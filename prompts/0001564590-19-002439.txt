Overview
 Manhattan Associates was founded in 1990 in Manhattan Beach, California and incorporated in Georgia in 1998. References in this filing to the “Company,” “Manhattan,” “Manhattan Associates,” “we,” “our” and “us” refer to Manhattan Associates, Inc., our predecessors, and our wholly-owned and consolidated subsidiaries. Our principal executive offices are located at 2300 Windy Ridge Parkway, Tenth Floor, Atlanta, Georgia 30339, and our telephone number is 770-955-7070. 
 We develop, sell, deploy, service and maintain software solutions designed to manage supply chains, inventory and omnichannel operations for retailers, wholesalers, manufacturers, logistics providers and other organizations. Our customers include many of the world’s premier and most profitable brands. 
 Specifically, Manhattan Associates develops modern commerce solutions that help its customers in three distinct areas of their business: 
  
• | Supply Chain - We provide companies the tools needed to manage distribution and optimize transportation costs throughout their entire commercial network. Manhattan’s Warehouse Management solutions are widely regarded as industry-leading systems designed to optimize productivity and throughput in distribution centers and warehouses around the world. Our software helps optimize fulfillment models to support our customers across a wide range of channels and fulfillment methods. Likewise, we provide shippers and carriers the most comprehensive transportation management solutions in the market. This includes software to help them move freight via the most cost-effective means possible while also meeting service-level expectations, to model their transportation network, and to automate the procurement-to-pay process.

• | Omnichannel - Meeting ever-evolving consumer expectations of service, inventory availability and delivery convenience is a challenge every merchant must meet head on. Manhattan’s Omnichannel solutions provide an operating platform for direct, brick and mortar, and wholesale businesses. Comprising Order Management, Point of Sale, and Customer Engagement as its core applications, Manhattan Omnichannel solutions provide CRM capabilities for contact center agents; end-to-end process enablement for store associates, and enterprise-wide inventory availability determination and order fulfillment optimization.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Inventory – Manhattan’s solutions provide distributors of finished goods (apparel, food, auto parts, pharmaceuticals, etc.) the ability to forecast demand, determine when, where and how much inventory is needed and translate this into a profitable inventory buying plan. These areas are ever more complex and critical to profitability as more wholesalers and retailers engage in omnichannel operations. Through the use of advanced science and sophisticated analytics, customer service level is maximized with the minimum necessary inventory investment. Industry changes driven by omni-channel retail, pharmaceutical regulations and other trends make this an area of particular need for many retailers and wholesale distributors.

Manhattan Associates’ Software Solution Portfolios 
 Our portfolio of solutions takes a platform-based approach to key areas.  This approach employs a holistic technology approach that provides customers with three major benefits:
  
• | Cross-Functional Business Solutions - By virtue of shared data, taxonomy and interfaces, platform solutions enable the organization to tackle business challenges that might otherwise be too technically daunting to achieve. For example, the ability to manage a buy online, pickup in store process at scale requires best in class capability within Order Management and Point of Sale/Store Systems. By building our solutions on a set of common, microservice based components, we eliminate data and process redundancy and deliver end-to-end process support for the modern merchant. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Lower Total Cost of Ownership - A single set of tools to administrate security, resource management, system configuration and integration across all three functional disciplines allows for economies of scale within IT departments. The use of standard technologies, development tools and languages also ensures needed technical skills are readily available in the marketplace. Furthermore, we also offer cloud-based/subscription-based access to certain of our applications, thus lowering initial and ongoing complexity of ownership.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Power of Shared Components - When an organization has multiple disparate systems, there are frequently costly, inefficient and redundant capabilities found across the enterprise. Examples include yard management, parcel shipping and inventory visibility. The consequences of duplicate systems range from the simple confusion brought on by different naming conventions to the expensive and complex data becoming out of sync, resulting in missed appointments, chargebacks and other issues.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Supply Chain Solutions 
 As previously described, Manhattan’s Supply Chain Solutions are focused on the distribution and transportation operations of the enterprise. There are three main components of Manhattan’s Supply Chain Solutions:

• | Distribution Management - These applications comprise Manhattan’s Warehouse Management Solutions (WMS) commonly used to manage the complexity of the modern distribution center. WMS manages the flow of goods and information across the distribution center. The complete distribution management suite not only includes capabilities focused on execution within the distribution center, but also on the management of personnel, performance, automation tools, robotics, and the overall distribution center layout. Manhattan’s WMS customers can benefit from its embedded warehouse execution system that coordinates the interaction between automation, robotics and labor for maximum efficiency. Manhattan’s WMS also enables the efficient utilization of a single distribution center for direct-to-consumer, retail replenishment and high-volume wholesale fulfilment. Our WMS provides the customer the most productive operation that can scale to meet the highest demands during peak season, yet can still operate effectively and profitably throughout the course of the year.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Transportation Management - Organizations today face a complex transportation environment with ever-changing demands driven by macro-economic trends and governmental regulations. Manhattan’s Transportation Management Solutions (TMS) are designed to help shippers navigate their way through these demands while meeting customer service expectations at the lowest possible freight costs. TMS components include procurement and modeling tools to setup a successful network, along with planning, execution and settlement tools to manage day-to-day transportation requirements. Our TMS can also connect shippers with a network of partners that can increase shipping capacity on an as-needed basis. Manhattan Carrier is a suite of solutions built specifically to help motor carriers optimize load assignments, minimize fuel costs, manage drivers’ hours of service and accommodate demand fluctuations. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Visibility - Crucial to effective supply chain management is visibility into the movement of goods between locations in the supply chain and outside the enterprise’s realm of control. Manhattan provides best in class visibility and event management tools that not only provide alerts to when events occur in the global supply chain, but also when they don’t occur (such as missing a vessel overseas) that can have a cascading effect on production lines, freight and, most importantly, customer commitments. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Manhattan SCALETM (SCALE) 
 SCALE is our portfolio of logistics execution solutions built on Microsoft’s .NET® platform. Purpose built for rapid development and a value-based total cost of ownership, it is targeted toward companies with execution-focused supply chain needs that require speed-to-value, resource-light system configuration and maintenance, and the ability to quickly scale their logistics operations up or down in response to market fluctuations or business requirement changes. SCALE combines the features of Trading Partner Management, Yard Management, Optimization, Warehouse Management and Transportation Execution. 
 Because SCALE leverages a common platform, solutions share common data elements and each user can access all applications through a single sign-on. Users also can set up “dashboards” that enable easy access to real-time information most relevant to their jobs. SCALE’s ease of deployment, operation and support make it a popular choice for organizations operating in countries with emerging and developing economies, and where technical support resources are limited.  
 Omnichannel Solutions 
 As omni-channel retail has placed new demands on organizations, it has also created new software solution needs.  These range from the ability to leverage inventory across the entire network to meet any demand, to providing store associates and call center representatives the means to take advantage of the available inventory.  Our Manhattan Active™ Omni set of solutions brings together Order Management, Store Inventory & Fulfillment, Point of Sale and Customer Engagement tools into a single application built on a shared, cloud-native, microservices platform.  This architecture enables our customers to more easily expand their systems to include more capabilities and quarterly product enhancements while always maintaining their customizations.

• | Enterprise Omnichannel Solutions - There is a wide range of new capabilities that must be leveraged at a corporate or ‘central’ level in retail today in order to enable best in class customer service, full inventory visibility, direct to client distribution and seamless fulfillment operations. The goal is to enable an omnichannel commerce platform that can be tapped into by any selling system—webstore, ERP, point-of-sale, call center, mobile app, etc. in order to more cost-effectively fulfill orders and inventory demand. Manhattan’s Enterprise Inventory builds out a complete inventory availability picture that can be updated in near-real time with feeds from the warehouse, the store and the network. Enterprise Order Management merges this inventory availability data with demand feeds from across the organization to match supply with demand in a way that satisfies customer delivery expectations while also striving to maximize profitability. Manhattan also offers a unique Customer Engagement solution that enables contact center associates to see a holistic view of the customer, as well as a complete customer sales and interaction history to better and more profitably satisfy shopper needs, regardless of whether it is an exchange, a return or a new order. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Omnichannel Solutions for the Store - As the consumer enters the store with more information than ever, it is vital to equip the sales associate with relevant information and capabilities to satisfy that shopper’s every demand. Store solutions include 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Point of Sale, available on mobile and fixed stations, to process purchase transactions and Clienteling to provide the associate with a complete picture of the shopper’s purchase history. Manhattan brings these solutions together on a single mobile platform to enable retailers to offer unparalleled service and convenience for the shopper.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Another important part of the Manhattan Active store offering is Store Inventory and Fulfillment. Most retailers are now looking to leverage store inventory to fulfill ecommerce demand (driving greater sales revenue with less inventory). In order to achieve this, solutions that can accurately maintain inventory integrity and enable productive, reliable fulfillment are required.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Inventory Solutions 
 The ability to accurately forecast demand and project inventory needs is heightened by omnichannel retail requirements that change traditional approaches to inventory management.  Manhattan’s Inventory solutions address which products should be carried and the quantity that will be needed at each location by date.

• | Inventory Optimization - This set of applications includes sophisticated demand forecasting capabilities that can address the particularly challenging slow-moving and intermittent products that frequently result in excess inventory due to unpredictability. Also included is the Replenishment module that can evaluate inventory needs across all locations and channels. This module can even suggest transferring inventory between locations (warehouses or stores) or ‘protect’ merchandise at a store from online sales in order to save it for walk-in traffic. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Planning - Manhattan’s Planning solutions provide merchants the tools they need to create channel-, store- or region-specific assortments. These tools offer channel-specific metrics and methodologies that optimize the planning process and maximize retailer revenues. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Technology Platform
 Our solutions can be deployed on Linux, IBM System i, Microsoft’s .NET computing platforms, as well as on all of the major public cloud infrastructures. Because omnichannel and supply chain solutions necessarily interact with other business operation systems, our solutions are designed to interoperate with software from other providers as well as with a company’s existing legacy systems. This interfacing and open system capability enables customers to continue using existing computer resources and to choose among a wide variety of existing and emerging computer hardware and peripheral technologies. We provide a framework to facilitate rapid and reliable integration to any Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) or host business system (including certified integration to both SAP and Microsoft Dynamics AX).  We also offer certain solutions in either on-premise software or cloud computing models so that customers can select the option that best meets their requirements for control, flexibility, cost of ownership, and time-to-deployment.
 To fulfil increasing market demand for software-as-a-service models, Manhattan offers Manhattan ActiveTM Solutions – cloud-native products designed to provide “always current” version-less product access. Like all Manhattan software, the solutions can be run on any type of device – mobile, tablet, or desktop. Manhattan Active solutions are sold directly in multi-year cloud subscription arrangements, typically for a period of three to more years, providing clients with regular software updates during the contract period to ensure access to the latest product features and benefiting Manhattan with a highly predictable and regular revenue stream.
 Maintenance
 We offer a comprehensive program that provides our perpetual license products with software upgrades for additional or improved functionality and technological advances incorporating emerging supply chain and industry advances. Over the past three years, our annual renewal rate for perpetual license customers subscribing to comprehensive support and enhancements has been greater than 90%. We are able to remotely access customer systems to perform diagnostics, provide online assistance, and facilitate software upgrades. We offer 24-hour customer support 365 days in the year, plus software upgrades for an annual fee that is paid in advance and is based on the solutions the customer has and the service level required. Software upgrades are provided under this program on a when-and-if- available basis. 
Professional Services 
 We advise and assist our customers in planning and implementing our solutions through our global Professional Services Organization. To ensure successful long-term customer relationships, consultants assist customers with the initial deployment of our systems, the conversion and transfer of the customer’s historical data onto our systems, and ongoing training, education, and system upgrades. We believe our Professional Services teams enable customers to implement our solutions knowledgeably and in the appropriate amount of time, help customers achieve expected results from system investments, continuously identify new opportunities for supply chain advancements and meaningfully add to our industry-specific knowledge base to improve future implementations and product innovations. 
 6

Substantially all of our customers utilize some portion of our Professional Services to implement and support our software solutions. Professional Services typically are rendered under time and materials contracts, with services billed by the hour. Professional Services sometimes are rendered under fixed-fee contracts, with payments due on specific dates or milestones. We believe that increased sales of our solutions will drive higher demand for our Professional Services. 
 Our Professional Services team delivers deep supply chain and enterprise commerce domain expertise to our customers through industry-specific “best-practices” protocols and processes developed through the collective knowledge we have gained from 29 years of implementing our supply chain solutions worldwide. We also extensively train our consulting personnel on enterprise commerce operations and on our solutions. 
 Business consultants, systems analysts, and technical personnel assist customers in all phases of implementing our systems, including planning and design, customer-specific module configuration, on-site implementation or conversion from existing systems, and integration with customer systems such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), web- and mobile-based commerce platforms, and Material Handling Equipment (MHE) systems. At times, third-party consultants, such as those from major systems integrators, assist our customers with certain implementations. 
 
Training and Change Management Services
 
We offer training and change management services for new and existing users, enabling our customers to align systems, people and processes. Services provided by Manhattan training experts cover a wide range of support from the intended design to the front-line of the customer’s business, including critical end-user adoption with hands-on, live training in a virtualized Manhattan software environment. These programs are provided at fixed fees per-person, per-class. In addition, computer-based training programs can be purchased for a fixed fee for use at client sites. Customers can also pursue certification at the Associate or Professional level through our certification programs for Omni-channel, Supply Chain or Inventory. 
 
Manhattan Training and Change Management Services are offered under six categories: Role-Based Training Paths, Comprehensive Training Programs, Change Management Services, Individual Product Training Courses, End-User Enablement and Knowledge Resources.
 Hardware Sales 
 As a convenience for our customers, we resell a variety of hardware developed and manufactured by others, including (but are not limited to) computer hardware, radio frequency terminal networks, RFID chip readers, bar code printers and scanners, and other peripherals. We resell all third-party hardware products and related maintenance pursuant to agreements with manufacturers or through distributor-authorized reseller agreements pursuant to which we are entitled to purchase hardware products and services at discount prices and to receive technical support in connection with product installations and any subsequent product malfunctions. We do not maintain hardware inventory as we generally purchase hardware from vendors only after receiving related customer orders. 
Strategy 
 Our objective is to extend our position as the leading global commerce solutions provider for organizations intent on creating and sustaining market advantages through technology-enabled commerce solutions. Our solutions help global distributors, wholesalers, retailers, logistics providers and manufacturers successfully manage accelerating and fluctuating market demands, as well as master the increasing complexity and volatility of their local and global supply chains. Our solutions are advanced, highly functional and highly scalable. They are designed to enable organizations to: create customer experiences consistent with their brand values; improve relationships with suppliers, customers and logistics providers; leverage investments across supply chain functions; effectively generate revenue and manage costs; and meet dynamically changing customer requirements. We believe our solutions are uniquely positioned to holistically optimize the way companies bring together omnichannel, supply chain and inventory management:
 Develop and Enhance Software Solutions. We continue to focus our research and development resources on enhancing our Supply Chain, Omnichannel Commerce and Inventory Solutions. We offer what we believe to be the broadest and most richly-featured software portfolio in the marketplace. To continuously expand functionality and value, we plan to continue to provide enhancements to existing solutions and to introduce new solutions to address evolving industry standards and market needs. We identify these opportunities through our Product Management, Professional Services, Customer Support and Account Management organizations through interactions such as ongoing customer consulting engagements and implementations, sessions with our solution user groups, association with leading industry analyst and market research firms, and participation on industry standards and research committees. Our solutions address needs in various vertical markets, including retail, consumer goods, food and grocery, logistics service providers, industrial and wholesale, high technology and electronics, life sciences and government. We intend to continue to enhance our solutions to meet the dynamic requirements of these and new vertical markets as business opportunities dictate.

Expand International Presence. Our solutions offer significant benefits to customers in markets around the world and for organizations with global operations. We have offices in Australia, Chile, China, France, Germany, India, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, Spain and the United Kingdom, as well as representatives in Mexico and reseller partnerships in Latin America, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, South Africa, and Asia. Our Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) operations support sales, implementation services, and customer support functions for customers in Europe as well as a number of customers across the Middle East, concentrated in countries we consider politically and economically stable. Our Asia Pacific (APAC) operations service emerging opportunities in China, Southeast Asia, and India, as well as more established markets in Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Our emerging markets international strategy includes leveraging the strength of our relationships with current U.S. and Europe-based customers that also have significant international operations. 
 Strategic Alliances and Indirect Sales Channels. We currently sell our products primarily through our direct sales personnel, and through partnership agreements with a select number of organizations in emerging markets where we do not currently have a direct sales presence. We have worked on joint projects and joint sales initiatives with industry-leading consultants and software systems implementers, including most of the large consulting firms specializing in our targeted industries, to supplement our direct sales force and professional services organization. We expand our indirect sales channels through reseller agreements, marketing agreements, and agreements with third-party logistics providers. These alliances extend our market coverage and provide us with new business leads and access to trained implementation personnel. 
 Acquire or Invest in Complementary Businesses. We continuously evaluate strategic acquisition opportunities of technologies, solutions, and businesses that are consistent with our platform-based strategy and enable us to enhance and expand our offerings. Preferred acquisition targets are those that would be complementary to our existing solutions and technologies, expand our geographic presence and distribution channels, extend our presence into additional vertical markets with challenges and requirements similar to those we currently serve, and further solidify our leadership position within the primary components of supply chain planning and execution. 
Sales and Marketing 
 We employ multi-disciplinary sales teams that consist of professionals with industry experience in sales and technical sales support. To date, we have generated the majority of our software license and cloud subscription revenue through our direct sales force. We plan to continue to invest in our sales, services, and marketing organizations within the Americas, EMEA, and APAC, and to pursue strategic marketing partnerships. We conduct comprehensive global marketing programs that include advertising, prospect profiling and targeting, lead generation, public relations, analyst relations, trade show attendance and sponsorships, supply chain conference hosting, digital marketing, joint promotion programs with vendors and consultants, and ongoing customer communication programs. 
 Our sales cycle typically begins with the generation of a sales lead — through in-house marketing efforts, advertising, targeted promotions, web inquiries, trade show presence, speaking engagements, hosted seminars, or other means of referral — or the receipt of a request for proposal from a prospective customer. Leads are qualified and opportunities are closed through a process that includes telephone-based assessments of requirements; responses to requests for proposals, presentations and product demonstrations, site visits and/or reference calls with organizations already using our supply chain solutions, and contract negotiations. Sales cycles vary substantially from opportunity to opportunity, but typically require nine to twelve months. 
 In addition to new customer sales, we continue to leverage our existing customer base to drive revenue from system upgrades, sales of additional licenses of purchased solutions, and sales of new or add-on solutions. To efficiently penetrate emerging global markets, we leverage indirect sales channels, including sales through reseller agreements, marketing agreements, and agreements with third-party logistics providers. To extend our market coverage, generate new business leads, and provide access to trained implementation personnel, we leverage strategic alliances with systems integrators skilled at implementing our solutions. Business referrals and leads are positively influenced by systems integrators, which include most of the large consulting firms and other systems consulting firms specializing in our targeted industries. 
 Our Manhattan Value Partner (Manhattan MVP™) and Manhattan GeoPartner™ programs foster joint sales and marketing with other organizations. Manhattan Value Partners are proven software and hardware providers, trusted third-party integrators and consultants who bring added value to customer engagements through vertical industry knowledge or technical specialization. Manhattan MVPs support and complement our supply chain solutions so we can provide customers with a comprehensive approach that is suited to their business requirements. This collaborative program is designed to benefit both Manhattan and our partners through tailored joint marketing, sales and, in some cases, co-development efforts. Among others, Manhattan MVPs include IBM, Deloitte, Kurt Salmon part of Accenture Strategy, Microsoft, Cap Gemini, HP, Zebra, Oracle and Intel. Manhattan GeoPartners represent a select group of companies that sell and implement our solutions in specific geographies around the world, each providing valuable localized expertise to meet customer needs in areas such as Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Russia, the Middle East, Latin America, Africa, and the Asia Pacific region.

Customers 
 To date, our customers have been suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and logistics providers in a variety of industries. Our top five customers (new or pre-existing) in the aggregate accounted for 13%, 9%, and 12% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 (“2018”), the year ended December 31, 2017 (“2017”) and the year ended December 31, 2016 (“2016”), respectively. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016. 
Product Development 
 We focus our development efforts on new product innovation and on adding new functionality to existing solutions; integrating our various solution offerings; enhancing the operability of our solutions across our platform and across distributed and alternative hardware platforms, operating systems, and database systems. We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to enhance existing solutions, to respond to dynamically changing customer requirements, and to develop new or enhanced solutions that incorporate new technological developments and emerging supply chain and industry standards. To that end, development frequently focuses on base system enhancements and incorporating new user requirements and features into our solutions. As a result, we deliver packaged, highly configurable solutions with increasingly rich functionality rather than custom-developed software. We also deliver interface toolkits for many major ERP systems to enhance communication and improve data flows between our core solutions and our clients’ host systems. 
 We leverage internal and external scientific advisors to inform our solution strategies and research and development approaches with the most advanced thinking on supply chain opportunities, challenges, and technologies. Our internal research team is comprised of Ph.D.-credentialed math and science experts who work on creating and solving algorithms and other constructs that advance the optimization capabilities and other aspects of our solutions. We also regularly communicate with and are advised by experts from leading educational institutions known for their supply chain disciplines, and practitioners from organizations deploying supply chain technology in innovative and market-advancing ways. Together, our research team and external advisors inform both the practical business approaches and the mathematical and scientific inventiveness of our solutions. 
 We conduct most research and development internally in the U.S. and India to retain domain knowledge and to promote programming continuity standards. However, we may periodically outsource some projects that can be performed separately and/or that require special skills. We also use third-party translation companies to localize our application software into various languages such as, but not limited to, Chinese, French, Japanese, and Spanish. 
 Competition 
 Our solutions are solely focused on enterprise commerce capabilities. Our solutions help global distributors, wholesalers, retailers, logistics providers and manufacturers successfully manage accelerating and fluctuating market demands, as well as master the increasing complexity and volatility of their local and global supply chains. Our solutions are designed to enable organizations to: create customer experiences consistent with their brand values; improve relationships with suppliers, customers and logistics providers; leverage investments across supply chain functions; effectively generate revenue and manage costs; and meet dynamically changing customer requirements characterized by rapid technological change in an intensely competitive environment. The principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our solutions include: industry expertise; company and solution reputation; company viability; compliance with industry standards; solution architecture; solution functionality and features; integration experience, particularly with ERP providers and material handling equipment providers; ease and speed of implementation; proven return on investment; historical and current solution quality and performance; total cost of ownership; solution price; and ongoing solution support structure. We believe we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors. 
 Our competitors are diverse and offer a variety of solutions directed at various aspects of enterprise commerce. Existing competitors include: 
  
• | Corporate information technology departments of current or potential customers capable of internally developing solutions;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ERP vendors, including Oracle, SAP, and Infor, among others;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | Supply chain execution and planning vendors, including JDA Software Group, Inc. (JDA), HighJump Software Inc., SAS Institute Inc., and the Sterling Commerce division of IBM, among others;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Point of sale vendors, including Aptos, Inc. and Oracle, among others; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Smaller independent companies that have developed or are attempting to develop supply chain execution solutions and/or planning solutions that apply in specific countries and/or globally.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We anticipate increased competition from ERP and supply chain management (SCM) applications vendors and from business application software vendors that may broaden their solution offerings by internally developing or by acquiring or partnering with independent developers of supply chain planning and execution software. Some of these ERP and other potential competitors have 
 9

longer operating histories; significantly more financial, technical, marketing and other resources; greater name recognition; broader solutions; and larger installed bases of customers than us. To the extent that ERP and SCM vendors or other large competitors develop or acquire systems with functionality comparable or superior to ours, their larger customer bases, long-standing customer relationships, and ability to offer broader solutions outside the scope of supply chain could create significant competitive advantage for them. It also is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and/or new competitors could emerge to win significant market share. Increased competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced earnings and margins and loss of market share. In turn, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow, and financial condition. 
 We believe we have established meaningful competitive differentiation through our supply chain and omnichannel commerce expertise; our platform-based solution approach; our track record of continuous supply chain commerce innovation and investment; our strong and endorsing customer relationships; our significant success in deploying and supporting supply chain, inventory and omnichannel solutions for market-leading companies; our success in helping our clients address the enterprise impacts of digital commerce; and our ability to out-execute others in identifying sales opportunities and demonstrating expertise throughout the sales cycle. However, to further our market success, we must continue to respond promptly and effectively to economic consumption models such as cloud subscription versus perpetual license, technological change and competitors’ innovations. Consequently, we cannot assure that we will not be required to make substantial additional investments in research, development, marketing, sales and customer service efforts in order to meet any competitive threat, or that we will be able to compete successfully in the future. 
 International Operations: Segments 
 We have three reportable segments based on geographic location: North and Latin America (the “Americas”); Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and Asia Pacific (“APAC”). For further information on our segments, see Note 7 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. International revenue includes all revenue derived from sales to customers outside the United States. At December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 1,700 employees in our international operations. 
 Proprietary Rights 
 We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trade secret, trademark, and trade dress laws, confidentiality procedures, and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights in our products, processes and technology. We have registered trademarks for Manhattan Associates and the Manhattan Associates logo, as well as a number of our products and features. Generally, we enter into confidentiality and assignment-of-rights agreements with our employees, consultants, customers and potential customers and limit access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information. We license our proprietary products to our customers under license agreements that we believe contain appropriate use and other restrictions in order to try to best protect our ownership of our products and our proprietary rights in them, and to protect our revenue potential from our products. However, despite our efforts to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights, we cannot ensure that we will successfully deter misappropriation, unintended disclosure or independent third-party development of our technology or our proprietary rights or information. Policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult, and, while we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software solutions exists, as is the case with any software company, piracy could become a problem. Further, to the extent that we enter into transactions in countries where intellectual property laws are not well developed or are poorly enforced, our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may be ineffective. Whether we seek to enforce our proprietary rights in the U.S. or abroad, our efforts, including litigation to enforce our rights, can result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, and such efforts, or our failure to succeed in such efforts, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, regardless of the final outcome. 
 As the number of supply chain management solutions available in the marketplace increases and solution functionality continues to overlap, supply chain software may increasingly become subject to claims of infringement or other misappropriation of intellectual property. Third parties may assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us relating to our products, processes or technology. Such claims, whether or not they have merit, generally are time-consuming and may result in costly litigation, divert management’s attention or cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements. Defense of infringement or other misappropriation claims, entering into royalty or licensing agreements, the unavailability of such agreements, or adverse determinations in proprietary rights litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. 
 Employees 
 At December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 3,000 employees worldwide. We have offices in Australia, Chile, China, France, Germany, India, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States, as well as representatives in Mexico and reseller partnerships in Latin America, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, South Africa, and Asia.
