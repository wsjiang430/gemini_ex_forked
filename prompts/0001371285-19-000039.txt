Item 1. Business 
Our Mission
Our mission is to help the pets we all love receive the best veterinary care.
Our Company and Approach
We provide medical insurance for cats and dogs throughout the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. Our data-driven, vertically-integrated approach enables us to provide pet owners with what we believe is the highest value medical insurance for the life of their pets, priced specifically for each pet’s unique characteristics. Our growing and loyal member base provides us with highly predictable and recurring revenue. We operate our business similar to other subscription-based businesses, with a focus on maximizing the lifetime value of each pet while sustaining a favorable ratio of lifetime value relative to acquisition cost, based on our desired return on investment.
Our target market is large and under-penetrated. We have pioneered a unique solution that sits at the center of the pet medical ecosystem, meeting the needs of pets, pet owners and veterinarians, and we believe we are uniquely positioned to continue to drive market penetration. Our aggregate total pets enrolled grew from 31,207 pets on January 1, 2010 to 521,326 pets on December 31, 2018, which represents a compound annual growth rate of 37%.
Total Revenue by New and Existing Pets Enrolled
(in millions)
It is very difficult for pet owners to budget for their pet becoming sick or injured when they don't know whether their pet's health will be average, lucky, or unlucky, and the cost of medical care varies dramatically by geography and pet breed. A pet owner budgeting for average medical care costs is not an effective solution for an unlucky pet. Additionally, the timing of accidents or illnesses may not align with the owner's budgeting approach. Our cost-plus model is designed to spread the risk evenly within each category of pets. Our goal is to charge each pet the appropriate amount for their specific circumstances (e.g., breed, age at enrollment, geography, etc.) so that each pet receives the same value proposition, and, in aggregate, the extra amount paid by lucky pets covers the veterinary costs incurred by unlucky pets. To an informed, responsible, and loving pet owner, Trupanion is a hedge to help them budget for the unexpected cost and variable timing of necessary veterinary care. 
We provide our members with a high-quality medical plan for the life of their cat or dog. Our product is simple, fair, and covers all unexpected illnesses and injuries, including those that are most likely to occur with particular breeds of pet, which other insurance providers may label as congenital or hereditary conditions. We pay 90% of actual veterinary costs if a pet becomes sick or injured, including all diagnostic tests, surgeries, and medications. In general, only certain taxes, examination fees, and medical issues existing prior to enrollment are not included. Once enrolled in our subscription, we pay for the veterinary costs for the pet's entire life, and pet owners are free to use any licensed veterinarian in the United States and Canada, including any referral or specialty hospital. We aim to pay veterinarians directly, within five minutes of the veterinary invoice being created and prior to the pet owner checking out, eliminating the traditional reimbursement model and providing our members the convenience of not having to pay out of pocket or confirm treatment. 
Veterinarians are able to recommend treatment to Trupanion members without having their decisions dictated by costs or the financial burden of the pet owner. Veterinarians, as a result, are able to establish stronger relationships and better alignment with pet owners who are protected by Trupanion. Our members tend to visit veterinarians more frequently and select the best course of treatment for their pet regardless of cost. 
We generate revenue primarily from our members' subscription fees. Fees are paid at the beginning of each subscription period, which automatically renews on a monthly basis. Since 2010, at least 88% of our subscription business revenue every quarter has come from existing members who had active subscriptions at the beginning of the quarter. Due to our focus on providing a superior value proposition and member experience, our members are very loyal, as evidenced by our 98.5% average monthly retention rate since 2010. For more information regarding average monthly retention, including an explanation of how we calculate this metric, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Operating Metrics.”
We enrolled our first pet in Canada in 2000 and our first pet in the United States in 2008. Our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $304.0 million, representing a compound annual growth rate of 41% from our revenue of $19.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. We have made and expect to continue to make substantial investments in member acquisition and in expanding our operations to support our expected growth. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we had a net loss of $0.9 million and our accumulated deficit was $83.7 million at December 31, 2018. 
Our Strategy
We are focused on attracting and retaining members by providing a best-in-class value and member experience by focusing on the following strategies:
Increase the number of referring veterinary practices. We intend to increase the number of veterinary practices that are actively introducing Trupanion to their clients. 
Increase the number of referrals from active veterinary practices. We intend to continue increasing the number and quality of interactions that we have with veterinarians to accelerate the rate at which active veterinary practices refer us leads.
Increase the number of third-party referrals from members. We believe that it is critical to our long-term success that existing members add a pet or refer their friends and family to Trupanion, so we focus on improving the member experience. For example, Trupanion Express® is designed to directly pay veterinary invoices, eliminating the reimbursement model and transforming the payment process to simplify the administrative hassle for our members.
Improve online lead generation and conversion. We are investing in our online marketing capabilities, and intend to continue to do so in order to fully capture the online opportunity. Our online marketing initiatives have played an integral role in converting leads to enrolled pets and also, to a lesser extent, in generating new leads.
Explore other member acquisition channels. We regularly evaluate new member acquisition channels. We intend to aggressively pursue those channels that we believe could, over time, generate an attractive ratio of lifetime value relative to acquisition cost, based on our desired return on investment.
Expand internationally. While we are primarily focused on capturing the large opportunity in the U.S. and Canadian markets, we are in the process of entering the Australian market and may choose to explore other international expansion in the future.
Pursue other revenue opportunities. We may opportunistically engage in other revenue opportunities. For example, our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, American Pet Insurance Company, has partnered with unaffiliated general agents offering pet insurance products since 2012.
Sales and Marketing
Marketing to Veterinarians
Veterinary practices represent our largest referral source, and combined with referrals from members, accounted for approximately 73% of our leads in 2018. Our Territory Partner model was designed to facilitate frequent, in-person, face-to-face communications with veterinarians and their staff about the benefits of Trupanion and high-quality medical insurance for the life of a pet. The most important job of a Territory Partner is to build strong relationships with each veterinary hospital, so the staff can trust and recommend Trupanion. Alignment with veterinarians is critical for a positive member experience, long-term retention, and pet owner referrals. We strongly believe that earning the trust of veterinarians and their staff is the first step to successfully capturing more of the North American market. 
The current market for veterinary services is highly fragmented and includes many sole-owner veterinary practices and small veterinary practices that are difficult to reach. We believe that no pet insurance company has a resource that compares in scale to our Territory Partners and that it would be extremely difficult, costly and time consuming to replicate. Our Territory Partners are independent contractors who market our product and are paid fees based on activity in their regions. Their role is not to sell or solicit policies directly to pet owners. Their role is instead to communicate and to build relationships with veterinarians and their staff, primarily through face-to-face interactions. We believe this structure aligns our interests and provides a platform that we can leverage over time.
Sales and Marketing to Pet Owners
We generate leads through a diverse set of third-party referrals and online member acquisition channels, which we then convert into members through our contact center and website.

• | Referrals from third-parties. We actively promote the value of Trupanion to veterinarians, veterinary affiliates (including purchasing groups and other veterinary membership organizations), corporate employee benefit providers, and shelters and breeders so they can inform their clients on the benefits of Trupanion. For the year ended December 31, 2018, 65% of our new pet enrollments were generated from these third-party referrals (excluding referral from existing members).


• | Referrals from existing members. For the year ended December 31, 2018, 26% of our new pet enrollments were generated from existing members adding a pet or referring their friends and family.


• | Online. We believe many of our members spend some time researching options before deciding to purchase our subscription. A significant portion of the members we acquire from online leads come through our paid search marketing, email marketing, social media marketing and search engine optimization initiatives.

Competition
We compete with consumers that self-fund veterinary costs with cash or credit, as well as traditional "pet insurance" providers and new entrants to our market. The vast majority of pet owners in the United States and Canada do not currently have medical insurance for their pets. We are primarily focused on expanding the overall size of the market by improving the value proposition for consumers. We view our primary competitive challenge as educating pet owners on why Trupanion is a better alternative to self-funding.
In addition, new entrants backed by large insurance companies with substantial financial resources have attempted to enter the market in the past and may do so again in the future. Further, traditional providers may consolidate, resulting in the emergence of new providers that are vertically integrated or able to create other operational efficiencies, which could lead to increased competition. We believe that we have competitive strengths that position us favorably related to existing and potential competitors. These include: a superior value proposition for pet owners due, in part, to our vertically integrated structure that reduces frictional costs; a unique member acquisition strategy, which we have developed using Territory Partners; a proprietary database containing historical data since the year 2000, which provides actionable data insights; a powerful technology infrastructure; and an experienced management team.
Intellectual Property
We rely on federal, state, common law, and international rights, as well as contractual restrictions, to protect our intellectual property. We control access to our proprietary technology, software, and documentation by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and partners, and confidentiality agreements with third parties, such as service providers, vendors, individuals and entities that may be exploring a business relationship with us. We also rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, patents, copyrights, trademarks, and domain names to establish and protect our intellectual property. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our technology, inventions, and improvements that are important to our business. We hold two U.S. patents related to the technology underlying our proprietary Trupanion Express platform, one patent for the design of the platform, and we have additional patent applications pending in the United States and in other jurisdictions. We additionally rely on data and market exclusivity, and patent term extensions when available. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to risk and may adversely impact our business.
Employees
We highly value our company culture. We are a mission-driven company and attract employees that share our passion for pets. Our culture enables our employees to channel that passion collectively toward our goals and is key to our success. As of December 31, 2018, we had 586 employees. 
Regulation
Each U.S. state, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories and possessions, as well as all of the Canadian provinces, have insurance laws that apply to companies licensed to transact insurance business in the jurisdiction. The primary regulator of an insurance company, however, is located in its state of domicile. Our insurance subsidiary, American Pet Insurance Company (APIC), is domiciled in New York State and its primary regulator is therefore the New York Department of Financial Services (NY DFS). APIC is currently licensed to do business in all 50 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia in the United States. As such, APIC is subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision under U.S. state and federal laws.
State insurance regulators have broad authority with respect to all aspects of the insurance industry, including the following:

• | licensing to transact business, and approval and issuance of certificates of authority;


• | revoking or suspending previously issued certificates of authority;


• | assessing the officers and directors to ensure a minimum level of competency and trustworthiness;


• | licensing of individual producers and agents and business entities marketing and selling insurance products;


• | licensing of claims adjusters and third-party administrators;


• | penalizing for noncompliance with respect to licensing requirements and regulations;


• | admitting assets to statutory surplus and regulating the nature of investments;


• | regulating premium rate levels for the insurance products offered;


• | approving policy forms;


• | regulating claims practices; and


• | establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards.

Regulators also have broad authority to perform on-site market conduct examinations of our management and operations, marketing and sales, underwriting, customer service, claims handling and licensing. Market conduct examinations can involve direct, on-site contact with a company to identify potential regulatory violations, discussion and correction of an identified problem, or obtaining a better understanding of how the company is operating in the marketplace.
State insurance laws and regulations in the United States require APIC to file financial statements with state insurance regulators everywhere it is licensed and its operations and accounts are subject to examination at any time. APIC’s statutorily required financial statements are available to the public. APIC prepares statutory financial statements in accordance with accounting practices and procedures prescribed or permitted by these regulators. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has approved a series of uniform statutory accounting principles (SAP) that have been adopted, in some cases with minor modifications, by all state insurance regulators. As a basis of accounting, SAP was developed to monitor and regulate the solvency of insurance companies. In developing SAP, insurance regulators were primarily concerned with assuring an insurer’s ability to pay all its current and future obligations to policyholders. As a result, statutory accounting focuses on conservatively valuing the assets and liabilities of insurers, generally in accordance with standards specified by the insurer’s domiciliary state. The values for assets, liabilities and equity reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles are usually different from those reflected in financial statements prepared under SAP.
In Canada, our medical insurance is written by an unaffiliated Canadian-licensed insurer, Omega General Insurance Company (Omega). Under the terms of our agreements with Omega, our subsidiary Trupanion Brokers Ontario acts as a general agent through a fronting and reinsurance agreement with Omega pursuant to which, we retain any financial risk associated with our Canadian business. Effective January 1, 2015, these agreements were restructured to include our segregated cell business, Wyndham Segregated Account AX (WICL), located in Bermuda. These restructured agreements automatically renew annually, but may be terminated by either party with one year’s written notice. Omega’s Canadian insurance operations are supervised and regulated by the Canadian federal, provincial and territorial governments. Omega is a fully licensed insurer in all of the Canadian provinces and territories in which we do business.
Though we are not directly regulated by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA), WICL’s regulation and compliance impacts us as it could have an adverse impact on the ability of WICL to pay dividends. WICL is regulated by the BMA under the Insurance Act of 1978 (Insurance Act) and the Segregated Accounts Company Act of 2000. The Insurance Act imposes on Bermuda insurance companies solvency and liquidity standards, certain restrictions on the declaration and payment of dividends and distributions, certain restrictions on the reduction of statutory capital, and auditing and reporting requirements, and grants BMA the powers to supervise and, in certain circumstances, to investigate and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies. Under the Insurance Act, WICL as a class 3 insurer is required to maintain available statutory capital and surplus at a level equal to or in excess of a prescribed minimum established by reference to net written premiums and loss reserves.
Under the Bermuda Companies Act of 1981, as amended, a Bermuda company may not declare or pay a dividend or make a distribution out of contributed surplus if there are reasonable grounds for believing that: (a) the company is, or would be after the payment, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due; or (b) the realizable value of the company’s assets would thereby be less than its liabilities. The Segregated Accounts Company Act of 2000 further requires that dividends out of a segregated account can only be paid to the extent that the cell remains solvent. The value of its assets must remain greater than the aggregate of its liabilities, issued share capital, and share premium accounts. Per our contractual agreements with WICL, the allowable dividend to be paid by WICL is equivalent to the positive undistributed profit attributable to the shares.
Insurance Holding Company Regulation
APIC is subject to laws governing insurance holding companies in New York, its state of domicile. These laws impact us in a number of ways, including the following:

• | We must file periodic information reports with the NY DFS, including information concerning our capital structure, ownership, financial condition and general business operations.


• | New York regulates certain transactions between APIC and our other affiliated entities, including the fee levels payable by APIC to affiliates that provide services to APIC.


• | New York law restricts the ability of any one person to acquire certain levels of our voting securities without prior regulatory approval. State insurance holding company regulations generally provide that no person, corporation or other entity may acquire control of an insurance company, or a controlling interest in any parent company of an insurance company, without the prior approval of such insurance company’s domiciliary state insurance regulator. Any person acquiring, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting securities of an insurance company is presumed to have acquired “control” of the company. To obtain approval of any change in control, the proposed acquirer must file with the applicable insurance regulator an application disclosing, among other information, its background, financial condition, the financial condition of its affiliates, the source and amount of funds by which it will effect the acquisition, the criteria used in determining the nature and amount of consideration to be paid for the acquisition, proposed changes in the management and operations of the insurance company and other related matters. In considering an application to acquire control of an insurer, the insurance commissioner generally will consider such factors as the experience, competence and financial strength of the applicant, the integrity of the applicant’s board of directors and executive officers, the acquirer’s plans for the management and operation of the insurer and any anti-competitive results that may arise from the acquisition.


• | New York law restricts the ability of APIC to pay dividends to its holding company parent. These restrictions are based in part on the prior year’s statutory income and surplus. In general, dividends up to specified levels are considered ordinary and may be paid without prior approval, and dividends in larger amounts, or extraordinary dividends, are subject to approval by the NY DFS. An extraordinary dividend or distribution is defined as a dividend or distribution that, in the aggregate in any 12-month period, exceeds the lesser of (i) 10% of surplus as of the preceding December 31 or (ii) the insurer’s adjusted net investment income for such 12-month period, not including realized capital gains.

Financial Regulation of Insurers
Risk-Based Capital Requirements
The NAIC has adopted risk-based capital requirements for life, health and property and casualty insurance companies. Refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for details of these requirements.
NAIC Insurance Regulatory Information System Ratios
The NAIC has developed a set of financial relationships or tests known as the Insurance Regulatory Information System, or IRIS, to assist state regulators in monitoring the financial condition of U.S. insurance companies and identifying companies requiring special attention or action. IRIS consists of a statistical phase and an analytical phase whereby financial examiners review insurers’ annual statements and financial ratios. The statistical phase consists of 12 key financial ratios based on year-end data that are generated from the NAIC database annually; each ratio has a “usual range” of results. For IRIS ratio purposes, APIC submits data annually to state insurance regulators who then analyze our data using prescribed financial data ratios. A ratio falling outside the prescribed “usual range” is not considered a failing result. Rather, unusual values are viewed as part of the regulatory early monitoring system. In many cases, it is not unusual for financially sound companies to have one or more ratios that fall outside the usual range. As of December 31, 2018, APIC had four such ratios outside the usual range, relating to net premiums written to surplus, change in policyholders’ surplus, and investment yield.
Regulators may investigate or monitor an insurance company if its IRIS ratios fall outside the prescribed usual range. The inquiries made by state insurance regulators into an insurance company’s IRIS ratios can take various forms. In some instances, regulators may require the insurance company to provide a written explanation as to the causes of the particular ratios being outside the usual range, management’s actions to produce results that will be within the usual range in future years and what, if any, actions the insurance company’s domiciliary state insurance regulators have taken. Regulators are not required to take action if an IRIS ratio is outside the usual range, but, depending on the nature and scope of the particular insurance company’s exception, regulators may request additional information to monitor going forward and, as a consequence, may take additional regulatory action.
Insurance Guaranty Associations, Residual Markets, Wind Pools and State-specific Reinsurance Mechanisms
Most jurisdictions in which we operate have laws or regulations that require insurance companies doing business in the state to participate in various types of guaranty associations or other similar arrangements designed to protect policyholders from losses under insurance policies issued by insurance companies that become impaired or insolvent. Typically, these associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on member insurers on the basis of the member insurer’s proportionate share of the business in the relevant jurisdiction in the lines of business in which the impaired or insolvent insurer is engaged. Some jurisdictions permit member insurers to recover assessments that they paid through full or partial premium tax offsets, usually over a period of years.
Some states in which APIC operates have residual markets, wind pools or state reinsurance mechanisms. The general intent behind these is to provide insurance to individuals and businesses that cannot find appropriate insurance in the private marketplace. The intent of state-specific reinsurance mechanisms generally is to stabilize the cost of, and ensure access to, reinsurance for admitted insurers writing business in the state. Historically, APIC has had minimal financial exposure to guaranty associations, residual markets, wind pools and state-specific reinsurance mechanisms; however there is no guarantee that these items will continue to be of low financial impact to APIC.
Federal Initiatives
The U.S. federal government generally does not directly regulate the insurance business. From time to time, various regulatory and legislative changes have been proposed in the insurance industry. Among the proposals that have in the past been, or are at present may be under consideration, are the possible introduction of federal regulation in addition to, or in lieu of, the current system of state regulation of insurers. There have also been proposals in various state legislatures (some of which have been enacted) to conform portions of their insurance laws and regulations to various model acts adopted by the NAIC. The NAIC has undertaken a Solvency Modernization Initiative focused on updating the U.S. insurance solvency regulation framework, including capital requirements, governance and risk management, group supervision, accounting and financial reporting and reinsurance. The NAIC Amendments are a result of these efforts. Additional requirements are also expected.
In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) established a Federal Insurance Office within the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The Federal Insurance Office initially is charged with monitoring all aspects of the insurance industry (other than health insurance, certain long-term care insurance and crop insurance), gathering data and conducting a study on methods to modernize and improve the insurance regulatory system in the United States. It is not possible to predict whether, in what form or in what jurisdictions any of these proposals might be adopted, or the effect federal involvement in insurance will have, if any, on us.
Privacy and Data Collection Regulation
There are numerous federal, state and foreign laws regarding privacy and the protection of member data. The regulatory environment in this area for online businesses is very unsettled in the United States and internationally and new legislation is frequently being proposed and enacted.
In the area of information security and data protection, many states have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards. In addition, our operations subject us to certain payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and rules, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, a security standard for companies that collect, store or transmit certain data regarding credit and debit cards, credit and debit card holders and credit and debit card transactions.
Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology or data to develop products that may compete with our offerings. Policing unauthorized use of our technology or data is difficult. The laws of other countries in which we operate may offer little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology. Our competitors could also independently develop technologies equivalent to ours, and our intellectual property rights may not be broad enough for us to prevent competitors from selling products incorporating those technologies.
Companies in our industry and in other industries may own a large number of patents, copyrights and trademarks and may frequently request license agreements, threaten litigation or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. From time to time, we face, and we expect to face in the future, allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, including our competitors. As we face increasing competition and as our business grows, we will likely face more claims of infringement.
