Corporate History and Recent Developments
 
We were incorporated pursuant to the laws of the State of Nevada on March 20, 2002 under the name Integrated Brand Solutions Inc., and on February 6, 2006, we changed our name to Upstream Biosciences Inc. From 2006 to December 2009, our company operated as a biotechnology company, and from 2010 until May 2013, our company had no operating business.
 
On May 24, 2013, our then majority stockholders sold their interests in our company to RealSource Acquisition Group, LLC, a Utah limited liability company, and Chesterfield Faring Ltd., a New York corporation, and on July 11, 2013, we changed our corporate name to RealSource Residential, Inc. Our initial business strategy in 2013 was to engage in various real estate related businesses. However, in 2016 we disposed of all of our real estate and other assets and continued operations as a public “shell” company.
 
On September 12, 2018, M1 Advisors, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company controlled by Michael Campbell, our current Chief Executive Officer and a director of our company (“M1 Advisors”), acquired from certain then majority stockholders of our company an aggregate of 440,256 shares (after giving effect to the subsequent reverse stock split described below) of our common stock, which shares represented approximately 70% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of our company at that time, for aggregate cash payments amounting to $260,000.
 
On September 12, 2018, following the closing of the change of control transaction described above, we entered into a Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Preferred Purchase Agreement”) with M1 Advisors, Piers Cooper, our newly appointed President and director, and the other investors who were signatories thereto (collectively, the Purchasers”). Pursuant to the Preferred Purchase Agreement, the Purchasers purchased from us an aggregate of 15,600,544 shares of Series A preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Series A Preferred Stock”), for an aggregate purchase price of $15,600.54, or $0.001 per share. Of the shares sold, 9,320,414 shares were purchased by M1 Advisors and 4,674,330 shares were purchased by Mr. Cooper. All of such shares of preferred stock were converted into shares of our common stock on December 20, 2018.
 
After the consummation of the change of control transaction and the sale of the Series A Preferred Stock on September 12, 2018 (the “Change of Control Transactions”), our company remained a shell company with no operating business. As a result of the September 12, 2018 transactions, our current executive officers and directors acquired effective control of our company and, in connection with such transactions, our board of directors determined to establish our company in the rapidly-growing legal cannabis industry, initially in the State of California. In order to fund such proposed business plan, we intend to raise additional funds from investors by issuing our common stock, preferred stock and/or debt securities to fund future operations, including the acquisition of manufacturing facilities and equipment.
 
On August 28, 2018, we filed a Certificate of Change to our Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to (i) reduce our authorized shares of common stock from 100,000,000 shares to 4,000,000 shares and (ii) to effectuate a stock combination or reverse stock split whereby every 25 outstanding shares of our common stock were converted into one share of common stock. This amendment became effective on August 30, 2018. All share and per share amounts in this Report have been restated to give effect to such reverse stock split.
 
On December 20. 2018, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to (i) change our corporate name from “RealSource Residential, Inc.” to “CalEthos, Inc.” and (ii) to increase our authorized shares of common stock from 4,000,000 shares to 100,000,000 shares. This amendment became effective immediately upon filing on December 20, 2018.
 
Plan of Operations
 
Immediately prior to the consummation of the Change of Control Transactions, our company was a shell company with no operating business. As a result of the Change of Control Transactions, Mr. Campbell acquired control of our company. It is the intention of Mr. Campbell to establish our company in the rapidly-growing legal cannabis industry, initially in the State of California, and our current management is currently exploring a number of business opportunities for engaging our company in such a business. In order to fund our proposed business plan, we intend to raise funds from investors by issuing common stock, preferred stock and/or debt securities. Upon the consummation of such fundraising efforts and the commencement of such operations, it is expected that our company will cease being a shell company.

At this time, the primary activity of our management is to seek, investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire an interest in business opportunities in the California cannabis industry. We will not restrict our search to any specific business, segment of the cannabis industry or geographical location and we may participate in a business venture of virtually any kind or nature.
 
This discussion of our proposed business is purposefully general and is not meant to be restrictive of our virtually unlimited discretion to search for and enter into potential business opportunities. Management anticipates that, initially, we may be able to participate in only one potential business venture because we have nominal assets and limited financial resources. This lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk to our shareholders because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another.
 
We may seek a business opportunity with entities that have recently commenced operations, or that wish to utilize the public marketplace in order to raise additional capital in order to expand into new products or markets, to develop a new product or service, or for other corporate purposes. We may acquire assets and establish wholly-owned subsidiaries in various businesses or acquire existing businesses as subsidiaries.
 
We anticipate that the selection of a business opportunity in which to participate will be complex and extremely risky. Due to general economic conditions, rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital. Our management believes there are numerous firms seeking the perceived benefits of a publicly-registered corporation. Such perceived benefits may include facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be sought, providing liquidity for incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, and providing liquidity (subject to restrictions of applicable statutes) for all shareholders, among other factors. Available business opportunities may occur in many different segments of the cannabis industry and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex.
 
Our officers have only limited experience in managing a shell company similar to ours and will rely upon their own efforts in accomplishing our business purposes. Nevertheless, we anticipate we will locate and make contact with possible target businesses primarily through the efforts of our officers and directors, who will meet personally with existing management and key personnel, visit and inspect material facilities, assets, products and services belonging to such prospects, and undertake such further reasonable investigation as they deem appropriate. Management has a network of business contacts, including our outside lawyers and accountants, and believes that prospective target businesses will be referred to us through this network.
 
We also anticipate that prospective target businesses will be brought to our attention from various other non-affiliated sources, including securities broker-dealers, investment bankers, venture capitalists, bankers, and other members of the financial community. We have neither the present intention, nor does the present potential exist for us, to consummate a business combination with a target business in which our management or their affiliates or associates directly or indirectly have a pecuniary interest, although no existing corporate policies would prevent this from occurring. We may engage the services of professional firms that specialize in finding business acquisitions and pay a finder’s fee or other compensation.
 
The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by, or under the supervision of, our officers and directors. In analyzing prospective business opportunities, management will consider such matters as the available technical, financial and managerial resources; working capital and other financial requirements; history of operations, if any; prospects for the future; nature of present and expected competition; the quality and experience of management services that may be available and the depth of that management; the potential for further research, development or exploration; specific risk factors not now foreseeable but that then may be anticipated to impact the proposed activities of our company; the potential for growth or expansion; the potential for profit; the perceived public recognition of, or acceptance of, products, services or trades; name identification; the regulatory landscape relating to the proposed business; and other relevant factors. Our officers and directors expect to meet personally with management and key personnel of the business opportunity as part of their investigation. To the extent possible, we intend to utilize written reports and investigation to evaluate the above factors. We will not acquire or merge with any company for which audited financial statements cannot be obtained within a reasonable period of time after closing of the proposed transaction. Our limited funds and the lack of full-time management, however, will likely make it impracticable to conduct a complete and exhaustive investigation and analysis of a target business before we commit our capital or other resources thereto. Management decisions, therefore, will likely be made without detailed feasibility studies, independent analysis, market surveys and the like which would be desirable if we had more funds available. We will be particularly dependent in making decisions upon information provided by the promoter, owner, sponsor or others associated with the business opportunity seeking our participation.

We will not restrict our search to any specific kind of business, but we may acquire a venture that is in its preliminary or development stage, which is already in operation, or in essentially any stage of its corporate life. It is impossible to predict at this time the status of any business in which we may become engaged, in that such business may need to seek additional capital, may desire to have its shares publicly traded, or may seek other perceived advantages which we may offer.
 
It is anticipated that we will incur expenses in the implementation of the business plan described herein, and such expenses may be substantial. However, we currently have only limited capital with which to pay these anticipated expenses.
 
The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business (including conducting a due diligence review) and to structure and consummate the business combination (including negotiating relevant agreements and preparing requisite documents for filing pursuant to applicable securities laws and state “blue sky” and corporation laws) cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Our officers and directors only devote a limited portion of their time to the operations of our company, and, accordingly, consummation of a business combination may require a greater period of time than if they devoted their full time to our company’s affairs. However, our officers and directors will devote such time as they deem reasonably needed.
 
In implementing a structure for a particular business opportunity, we may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, joint venture or licensing agreement with another corporation or entity. We may also acquire the stock or assets of an existing business. Upon the consummation of a transaction, it is possible that our present management and shareholders will no longer be in control of our company. In addition, our directors may, as part of the terms of the acquisition transaction, resign and be replaced by new directors without a vote of our current shareholders or may sell their stock in our company. Any and all such sales will only be made in compliance with the securities laws of the United States and any applicable state.
 
It is anticipated that any securities issued in any such reorganization will be issued in reliance upon exemption from registration under applicable federal and state securities laws. In some circumstances, however, as a negotiated element of its transaction, we may agree to register all or a part of such securities immediately after the transaction is consummated or at specified times thereafter. If such registration occurs, of which there can be no assurance, it will be undertaken by the surviving entity after we have successfully consummated a merger or acquisition and we are no longer considered a “shell” company. Until such time as this occurs, we do not intend to register any additional securities. The issuance of substantial additional securities and their potential sale into any trading market that may develop in our securities may have a depressive effect on the value of our securities in the future, if such a market develops, of which there is no assurance.
 
As a general rule, federal and state tax laws and regulations have a significant impact upon the structuring of business combinations. We will evaluate the possible tax consequences of any prospective business combination and will endeavor to structure a business combination so as to achieve the most favorable tax treatment for us, the target company and their respective stockholders. However, there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or relevant state tax authorities will ultimately assent to our tax treatment of a particular consummated business combination.
 
To the extent the IRS or any relevant state tax authorities ultimately prevail in recharacterizing the tax treatment of a business combination, there may be adverse tax consequences to us, the target business and their respective stockholders. Tax considerations as well as other relevant factors will be evaluated in determining the precise structure of a particular business combination, which could be effected through various forms of a merger, consolidation or stock or asset acquisition.

While the actual terms of a transaction to which we may be a party cannot be predicted, it may be expected that the parties to the business transaction will find it desirable to avoid the creation of a taxable event and thereby structure the acquisition in a so-called “tax-free” reorganization under Sections 368(a) (1) or 351 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). In order to obtain tax-free treatment under the Code, it may be necessary for the owners of the target business to own 80% or more of the voting stock of the surviving entity. In such event, our shareholders would retain less than 20% of the issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity, which would result in significant dilution in the equity of such shareholders. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that the IRS or relevant state tax authorities will ultimately assent to our tax treatment of a particular consummated business combination.
 
With respect to any merger or acquisition, negotiations with the target company’s management is expected to focus on the percentage of our company that the target company shareholders would acquire in exchange for all of their shareholdings in the target company. Depending upon, among other things, the target company’s assets and liabilities, it is possible that our shareholders will hold a substantially lesser percentage ownership interest in our company following any merger or acquisition. The percentage ownership may be subject to significant reduction in the event we acquire a target company with substantial assets. Any merger or acquisition effected by us can be expected to have a significant dilutive effect on the percentage of shares held by our then shareholders.
 
We will participate in a business opportunity only after the negotiation and execution of appropriate written agreements. Although the terms of such agreements cannot be predicted, generally such agreements will require some specific representations and warranties by all of the parties thereto, will specify certain events of default, will detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must be satisfied by each of the parties prior to and after such closing, will outline the manner of bearing costs, including costs associated with our attorneys and accountants, will set forth remedies on default and will include miscellaneous other terms.
 
As stated hereinabove, we will not acquire or merge with any entity that cannot provide independent audited financial statements within a reasonable period of time after closing of the proposed transaction. We are subject to all of the reporting requirements included in the Exchange Act. Included in these requirements is the affirmative duty to file independent audited financial statements as part of our Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission upon consummation of a merger or acquisition, as well as the audited financial statements included in our annual report on Form 10-K. If such audited financial statements are not available at closing, or within time parameters necessary to insure our compliance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, or if the audited financial statements provided do not conform to the representations made by the candidate to be acquired in the closing documents, the closing documents will provide that the proposed transaction will be voidable, at the discretion of our present management.
 
We do not intend to provide our security holders with any complete disclosure documents, including audited financial statements, concerning an acquisition or merger candidate and its business prior to the consummation of any acquisition or merger transaction.
 
Our company will remain an insignificant participant among the firms that engage in the acquisition of business opportunities in the cannabis industry, particularly in the State of California. There are many established venture capital and financial concerns that have significantly greater financial and personnel resources and technical expertise than we have. In view of our combined extremely limited financial resources and limited management availability, we will continue to be at a significant competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors.
 
We have had in the past, and continue to have, discussions with potential acquisition targets, or merger or acquisition partners, and while we do not have a definitive agreement in place with any potential acquisition target or partner to do so, we anticipate issuing shares of our common stock, and possibly preferred stock, as part of any merger or acquisition with a merger or acquisition partner.
