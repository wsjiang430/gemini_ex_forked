Item 1.    Business
Our Business
Ally Financial Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context otherwise requires, Ally, the Company, or we, us, or our) is a leading digital financial-services company with $178.9 billion in assets as of December 31, 2018. As a customer-centric company with passionate customer service and innovative financial solutions, we are relentlessly focused on “Doing It Right” and being a trusted financial-services provider to our consumer, commercial, and corporate customers. We are one of the largest full-service automotive-finance operations in the country and offer a wide range of financial services and insurance products to automotive dealerships and consumers. Our award-winning online bank (Ally Bank, Member FDIC and Equal Housing Lender) offers mortgage-lending services and a variety of deposit and other banking products, including savings, money-market, and checking accounts, certificates of deposit (CDs), and individual retirement accounts (IRAs). We also support the Ally CashBack Credit Card. Additionally, we offer securities-brokerage and investment-advisory services through Ally Invest. Our robust corporate-finance business offers capital for equity sponsors and middle-market companies.
We are a Delaware corporation and are registered as a bank holding company (BHC) under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (BHC Act), and a financial holding company (FHC) under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, as amended (GLB Act). Our primary business lines are Dealer Financial Services, which comprises our Automotive Finance and Insurance operations, Mortgage Finance, and Corporate Finance. Corporate and Other primarily consists of centralized corporate treasury activities, the management of our legacy mortgage portfolio, the activity related to Ally Invest, and reclassifications and eliminations between the reportable operating segments. Ally Bank’s assets and operating results are included within our Automotive Finance, Mortgage Finance, and Corporate Finance segments, as well as Corporate and Other, based on its underlying business activities. As of December 31, 2018, Ally Bank had total assets of $159.0 billion and total deposits of $106.2 billion.
Our strategic focus is centered around continuing to optimize our Automotive Finance and Insurance operations, to grow our deposits and customers, to increase the scale of our digital product offerings, to maintain efficient capital management and disciplined risk management, to build the long-term value of our business, and to foster a culture of relentlessly focusing on our customers, communities, associates, and stockholders. Within our Automotive Finance and Insurance operations, we are focused on strengthening our network of dealer relationships and pursuing digital distribution channels for our products and services, including through our operation of a direct-lending platform, our participation in other direct-lending platforms, and our work with dealers innovating in digital transactions—all while maintaining an appropriate level of risk. We also seek to extend our leading position in automotive finance in the United States by continuing to provide automotive dealers and their retail customers with premium service, a comprehensive product suite, consistent funding, and competitive pricing—reflecting our commitment to the automotive industry. Within our other banking operations—including Mortgage Finance and Corporate Finance—we seek to prudently expand our consumer and commercial banking products and services while providing a high level of customer service. In addition, we continue to focus on delivering significant and sustainable growth in deposit customers and balances while optimizing our cost of funds. At Ally Invest, we look to augment our securities brokerage and investment advisory services to more comprehensively assist our customers in managing their savings and wealth.
We continue to invest in enhancing the customer experience with integrated features across product lines on our digital platform. We also continue to build on our existing foundation of approximately 6.0 million consumer automotive financing and primary deposit customers, strong brand, and innovative culture. Upon launching our first ever enterprise-wide campaign themed “Do It Right,” we introduced a broad audience to our full suite of digital financial services, which emphasizes our relentless customer-centric focus and commitment to constantly create and reinvent our product offerings and digital experiences to meet the needs of consumers. Our product offerings and brand continue to gain traction in the marketplace, as demonstrated by industry recognition of our award-winning direct online bank and strong retention rates of our customer base.
Unless the context otherwise requires, the following definitions apply. The term “loans” means the following consumer and commercial products associated with our direct and indirect financing activities: loans, retail installment sales contracts, lines of credit, and other financing products excluding operating leases. The term “operating leases” means consumer- and commercial-vehicle lease agreements where Ally is the lessor and the lessee is generally not obligated to acquire ownership of the vehicle at lease-end or compensate Ally for the vehicle’s residual value. The terms “lend,” “finance,” and “originate” mean our direct extension or origination of loans, our purchase or acquisition of loans, or our purchase of operating leases as applicable. The term “consumer” means all consumer products associated with our loan and operating-lease activities and all commercial retail installment sales contracts. The term “commercial” means all commercial products associated with our loan activities, other than commercial retail installment sales contracts.

Industry and Competition
The markets for automotive financing, insurance, banking (including corporate finance and mortgage finance), securities brokerage, and investment-advisory services are highly competitive. We directly compete in the automotive financing market with banks, credit unions, captive automotive finance companies, and independent finance companies. Our insurance business also faces significant competition from automotive manufacturers, captive automotive finance companies, insurance carriers, third-party administrators, brokers, and other insurance-related companies. Some of these competitors in automotive financing and insurance, such as captive automotive finance companies, have 
3

Ally Financial Inc. • Form 10-K

certain exclusivity privileges with automotive manufacturers whose customers and dealers make up a significant portion of our customer base. In addition, our banking, securities brokerage, and investment-advisory businesses face intense competition from banks, savings associations, finance companies, credit unions, mutual funds, investment advisers, asset managers, brokerage firms, hedge funds, insurance companies, mortgage-banking companies, and credit card companies. Financial-technology (fintech) companies also have been partnering more often with financial services providers to compete against us in lending and other markets. Many of our competitors have substantial positions nationally or in the markets in which they operate. Some of our competitors have significantly greater scale, financial and operational resources, investment capacity, and brand recognition as well as lower cost structures, substantially lower costs of capital, and much less reliance on securitization, unsecured debt, and other capital markets. Our competitors may be subject to different and, in some cases, less stringent legislative, regulatory, and supervisory regimes than we are. A range of competitors differ from us in their strategic and tactical priorities and, for example, may be willing to suffer meaningful financial losses in the pursuit of disruptive innovation or to accept more aggressive business, compliance, and other risks in the pursuit of higher returns. Competition affects every aspect of our business, including product and service offerings, rates, pricing and fees, and customer service. Successfully competing in our markets also depends on our ability to innovate, to invest in technology and infrastructure, to maintain and enhance our reputation, and to attract, retain, and motivate talented employees, all the while effectively managing risks and expenses. We expect that competition will only intensify in the future.
Regulation and Supervision
We are subject to significant regulatory frameworks in the United States—at federal, state, and local levels—that affect the products and services that we may offer and the manner in which we may offer them, the risks that we may take, the ways in which we may operate, and the corporate and financial actions that we may take.
We are also subject to direct supervision and periodic examinations by various governmental agencies and industry self-regulatory organizations (SROs) that are charged with overseeing the kinds of business activities in which we engage, including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB), the Utah Department of Financial Institutions (UDFI), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (CFPB), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and a number of state regulatory and licensing authorities such as the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). These agencies and organizations generally have broad authority and discretion in restricting and otherwise affecting our businesses and operations and may take formal or informal supervisory, enforcement, and other actions against us when, in the applicable agency’s or organization’s judgment, our businesses or operations fail to comply with applicable law, comport with safe and sound practices, or meet its supervisory expectations.
This system of regulation, supervision, and examination is intended primarily for the protection and benefit of our depositors and other customers, the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF), the banking and financial systems as a whole, and the broader economy—and not for the protection or benefit of our stockholders (except in the case of securities laws) or non-deposit creditors. The scope, intensity, and focus of this system can vary from time to time for reasons that range from the state of the economic and political environments to the performance of our businesses and operations, but for the foreseeable future, we expect to remain subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and examinations.
This section summarizes some relevant provisions of the principal statutes, regulations, and other laws that apply to us. The descriptions, however, are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by the full text and judicial or administrative interpretations of those laws and other laws that affect us.
Bank Holding Company, Financial Holding Company, and Depository Institution Status
Ally and IB Finance Holding Company, LLC (IB Finance) are BHCs under the BHC Act. Ally is also an FHC under the GLB Act. IB Finance is a direct subsidiary of Ally and the direct parent of Ally Bank, which is a commercial bank that is organized under the laws of the State of Utah and whose deposits are insured by the FDIC under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act). As BHCs, Ally and IB Finance are subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the FRB. Ally Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System and is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the FRB and the UDFI.

• | Permitted Activities — Under the BHC Act, BHCs and their subsidiaries are generally limited to the business of banking and to closely related activities that are incident to banking. The GLB Act amended the BHC Act and created a regulatory framework for FHCs, which are BHCs that meet certain qualifications and elect FHC status. FHCs, directly or indirectly through their nonbank subsidiaries, are generally permitted to engage in a broader range of financial and related activities than those that are permissible for BHCs—for example, (1) underwriting, dealing in, and making a market in securities; (2) providing financial, investment, and economic advisory services; (3) underwriting insurance; and (4) merchant banking activities. The FRB regulates, supervises, and examines FHCs, as it does all BHCs, but insurance and securities activities conducted by an FHC or any of its nonbank subsidiaries are also regulated, supervised, and examined by functional regulators such as state insurance commissioners, the SEC, or FINRA. Ally’s status as an FHC allows us to provide insurance products and services, to deliver our SmartAuction finder services and a number of related vehicle-remarketing services for third parties, and to offer a range of brokerage and advisory services. To remain eligible to conduct these broader financial and related activities, Ally and Ally Bank must remain “well-capitalized” and “well-managed” as defined under applicable law. Refer to Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the section below titled Basel Capital Frameworks for additional information. In addition, our ability to expand these financial and related activities or to make acquisitions generally requires that we achieve a satisfactory or better rating under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA).

Further, under the BHC Act, we may be subject to approvals, conditions, and other restrictions when seeking to acquire control over another entity or its assets. For this purpose, control includes (a) directly or indirectly owning, controlling, or holding the power to vote 25% or more of any class of the entity’s voting securities, (b) controlling in any manner the election of a majority of the entity’s directors, trustees, or individuals performing similar functions, or (c) directly or indirectly exercising a controlling influence over the management or policies of the entity. For example, Ally generally may not directly or indirectly acquire control of more than 5% of any class of voting securities of any unaffiliated bank or BHC without first obtaining FRB approval.

• | Enhanced Prudential Standards — Ally is currently subject to enhanced prudential standards that have been established by the FRB as required or authorized under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act). In May 2018, targeted amendments to the Dodd-Frank Act and other financial-services laws were enacted through the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (EGRRCP Act), including amendments that affect whether and, if so, how the FRB applies enhanced prudential standards to BHCs like us with $100 billion or more but less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the FRB and other U.S. banking agencies issued proposals that would implement these amendments in the EGRRCP Act and establish risk-based categories for determining the prudential standards and the capital and liquidity requirements that apply to large U.S. banking organizations. Under the proposals, Ally would be treated as a Category IV firm and, as such, would be (1) made subject to the FRB’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) on a two-year cycle rather than the current one-year cycle, (2) made subject to supervisory stress testing on a two-year cycle rather than the current one-year cycle, (3) required to continue submitting an annual capital plan to the FRB for non-objection, (4) allowed to continue excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) from regulatory capital, (5) required to continue maintaining a buffer of unencumbered highly liquid assets to meet projected net cash outflows for 30 days, (6) required to conduct liquidity stress tests on a quarterly basis rather than the current monthly basis, (7) allowed to engage in more tailored liquidity risk management, including monthly rather than weekly calculations of collateral positions, the elimination of limits for activities that are not relevant to the firm, and fewer required elements of monitoring of intraday liquidity exposures, (8) exempted from company-run stress testing, the modified liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), and the proposed modified net stable funding ratio (NSFR), and (9) allowed to remain exempted from the supplementary leverage ratio, the countercyclical capital buffer, and single-counterparty credit limits. In the proposals, the FRB also expressed an intent to propose at a later date similar amendments to its capital-plan rule and a separate rulemaking on the applicability of resolution-planning requirements to banking organizations with $100 billion or more but less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets. The FRB and other U.S. banking agencies control when and how the existing proposals and any future proposals may be considered and adopted, and their actions cannot be predicted with any certainty. In the meantime, Ally remains subject to the enhanced prudential standards and the capital and liquidity requirements as currently applied and, in the case of the latter, further described later in this section.


• | Liquidity Coverage Ratio Requirements — The FRB and other U.S. banking agencies have adopted the LCR consistent with international standards developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee). The LCR complements the enhanced prudential standards for managing liquidity risk and establishes a minimum quantitative ratio of high-quality liquid assets to total net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period. Pending the adoption of proposals described earlier in Enhanced Prudential Standards, Ally is subject to a modified and less stringent version of the LCR that applies to BHCs with $100 billion or more but less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets and less than $10 billion in foreign exposures. Ally is required to calculate its LCR on a monthly basis and is subject to a minimum LCR of 100%. Additionally, effective October 1, 2018, Ally is required to publicly disclose quantitative information about its LCR calculation and a qualitative discussion of the factors that have a significant effect on its LCR.


• | Capital Adequacy Requirements — Ally and Ally Bank are subject to various capital adequacy requirements. Refer to Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the section below titled Basel Capital Frameworks for additional information.


• | Capital Planning and Stress Tests — Pending the adoption of proposals described earlier in Enhanced Prudential Standards, Ally must comply with the FRB’s current capital planning and stress testing requirements for large and noncomplex BHCs with $100 billion or more but less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets and less than $75 billion in total nonbank assets. Specifically, Ally is subject to annual supervisory and semiannual company-run stress tests and must submit a proposed capital plan to the FRB annually in connection with CCAR. The proposed capital plan must include an assessment of our expected uses and sources of capital and a description of all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon, including any issuance of a debt or equity capital instrument, any dividend or other capital distribution, and any similar action that the FRB determines could have an impact on Ally’s capital. The proposed capital plan must also include a discussion of how Ally, under expected and stressful conditions, will maintain capital commensurate with its risks and above the minimum regulatory capital ratios and will serve as a source of strength to Ally Bank. The FRB will either object to Ally’s proposed capital plan, in whole or in part, or provide a notice of non-objection. If the FRB objects to the proposed capital plan, or if certain material events occur after approval of the plan, Ally must submit a revised capital plan within 30 days. Ally received a non-objection to its 2018 capital plan in June 2018.

The FRB’s quantitative assessment of Ally’s proposed capital plan is based on the FRB’s estimate of Ally’s post-stress capital ratios under the supervisory stress test. Pending the adoption of proposals described earlier in Enhanced Prudential Standards, the FRB also requires Ally to conduct semiannual company-run stress tests under baseline, adverse, and severely adverse economic scenarios over a nine-quarter planning horizon. For the 2018 stress testing cycle, Ally submitted the results of its company-run stress tests to the FRB in April and October 2018.

Ally Financial Inc. • Form 10-K

In January 2017, the FRB amended its capital planning and stress testing rules, effective for the 2017 cycle and beyond. As a result of this amendment, the FRB may no longer object to the capital plan of a large and noncomplex BHC, like Ally, on the basis of qualitative deficiencies in its capital planning process. Instead, the qualitative assessment of Ally’s capital planning process is now conducted outside of CCAR through the supervisory review process. The amendment also decreased the de minimis threshold for the amount of capital that Ally could distribute to stockholders outside of an approved capital plan without the FRB’s prior approval, and modified Ally’s reporting requirements to reduce unnecessary burdens.
The FRB publishes summary quantitative results of the supervisory stress test of each large and noncomplex BHC, like Ally, ordinarily in June in connection with the culmination of the CCAR process. Additionally, we publicly disclose summary results of each company-run stress test under the severely adverse economic scenario in accordance with regulatory requirements. In 2018, we disclosed the summary results of our annual stress test on June 28, 2018, and the summary results of our mid-cycle stress test on October 5, 2018.
During the first quarter of 2019, the FRB announced that a number of large and noncomplex BHCs with $100 billion or more but less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets, including Ally, will not be required to submit a capital plan to the FRB, participate in the supervisory stress test or CCAR, or conduct company-run stress tests during the 2019 cycle. Instead, Ally’s capital actions during this cycle will be largely based on the results from its 2018 supervisory stress test.

• | Resolution Planning — Under the Dodd-Frank Act, Ally is required to periodically submit to the FRB and the FDIC plans (commonly known as a living will) for the rapid and orderly resolution of Ally and its significant legal entities under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and other applicable insolvency laws in the event of future material financial distress or failure. If the FRB and the FDIC jointly determine that the resolution plan is not credible and the deficiencies are not adequately remedied in a timely manner, they may jointly impose on us more stringent capital, leverage, or liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth, activities, or operations. Further, if we were to fail to address any deficiencies in our resolution plan when required, we could eventually be compelled to divest specified assets or operations. Ally submitted its most recent resolution plan to the FRB and the FDIC on December 31, 2017. In addition, under rules issued by the FDIC, Ally Bank is required to periodically submit to the FDIC a separate resolution plan, which is similarly assessed for its credibility. The most recent Ally Bank plan was filed on July 1, 2018. The public versions of the resolution plans previously submitted by Ally and Ally Bank are available on the FRB’s and the FDIC’s websites. With the enactment of the EGRRCP Act, the FRB and the FDIC have expressed their intent to revise the resolution-planning requirements for banking organizations like Ally and Ally Bank with $100 billion or more but less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets. As with related proposals, the FRB and the FDIC control when and how the revisions may be considered and adopted, and their actions cannot be predicted with any certainty.


• | Limitations on Bank and BHC Dividends and Other Capital Distributions — Federal and Utah law place a number of conditions, limits, and other restrictions on dividends and other capital distributions that may be paid by Ally Bank to IB Finance and thus indirectly to Ally. In addition, even if the FRB does not object to our capital plan, Ally and IB Finance may be precluded from or limited in paying dividends or other capital distributions without the FRB’s approval under certain circumstances—for example, when Ally or IB Finance would not meet minimum regulatory capital ratios after giving effect to the distributions. FRB supervisory guidance also directs BHCs like us to consult with the FRB prior to increasing dividends, implementing common-stock-repurchase programs, or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments. Further, the U.S. banking agencies are authorized to prohibit an insured depository institution, like Ally Bank, or a BHC, like Ally, from engaging in unsafe or unsound banking practices and, depending upon the circumstances, could find that paying a dividend or other capital distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice.


• | Transactions with Affiliates — Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the FRB’s Regulation W prevent Ally and its nonbank subsidiaries from taking undue advantage of the benefits afforded to Ally Bank as a depository institution, including its access to federal deposit insurance and the FRB’s discount window. Pursuant to these laws, “covered transactions”—including Ally Bank’s extensions of credit to and asset purchases from its affiliates—are generally subject to meaningful restrictions. For example, unless otherwise exempted, (1) covered transactions are limited to 10% of Ally Bank’s capital stock and surplus in the case of any individual affiliate and 20% of Ally Bank’s capital stock and surplus in the case of all affiliates; (2) Ally Bank’s credit transactions with an affiliate are generally subject to stringent collateralization requirements; (3) with few exceptions, Ally Bank may not purchase any “low quality asset” from an affiliate; and (4) covered transactions must be conducted on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices (collectively, Affiliate Transaction Restrictions). In addition, transactions between Ally Bank and an affiliate must be on terms and conditions that are either substantially the same as or more beneficial to Ally Bank than those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving nonaffiliates.

Furthermore, these laws include an attribution rule that treats a transaction between Ally Bank and a nonaffiliate as a transaction between Ally Bank and an affiliate to the extent that the proceeds of the transaction are used for the benefit of or transferred to the affiliate. Thus, Ally Bank’s purchase from a dealer of a retail installment sales contract involving a vehicle for which Ally provided floorplan financing is subject to the Affiliate Transaction Restrictions because the purchase price paid by Ally Bank is ultimately transferred by the dealer to Ally to pay off the floorplan financing.
The Dodd-Frank Act tightened the Affiliate Transaction Restrictions in a number of ways. For example, the definition of covered transactions was expanded to include credit exposures arising from derivative transactions, securities lending and 
6

Ally Financial Inc. • Form 10-K

borrowing transactions, and the acceptance of affiliate-issued debt obligations (other than securities) as collateral. For a credit transaction that must be collateralized, the Dodd-Frank Act also requires that collateral be maintained at all times while the credit extension or credit exposure remains outstanding and places additional limits on acceptable collateral.

• | Source of Strength — The Dodd-Frank Act codified the FRB’s policy requiring a BHC, like Ally, to serve as a source of financial strength for a depository institution subsidiary, like Ally Bank, and to commit resources to support the subsidiary in circumstances when Ally might not otherwise elect to do so. This commitment is also reflected in Ally Bank’s application for membership in the Federal Reserve System, as described in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The functional regulator of any nonbank subsidiary of Ally, however, may prevent that subsidiary from directly or indirectly contributing its financial support, and if that were to preclude Ally from serving as an adequate source of financial strength, the FRB may instead require the divestiture of Ally Bank and impose operating restrictions pending such a divestiture.


• | Single Point of Entry Resolution Authority — Under the Dodd-Frank Act, a BHC whose failure would have serious adverse effects on the financial stability of the United States may be subjected to an FDIC-administered resolution regime called the orderly liquidation authority as an alternative to bankruptcy. If Ally were to be placed into receivership under the orderly liquidation authority, the FDIC as receiver would have considerable rights and powers in liquidating and winding up Ally, including the ability to assign assets and liabilities without the need for creditor consent or prior court review and the ability to differentiate and determine priority among creditors. In doing so, moreover, the FDIC’s primary goal would be a liquidation that mitigates risk to the financial stability of the United States and that minimizes moral hazard. Under the FDIC’s proposed Single Point of Entry strategy for the resolution of a systemically important financial institution under the orderly liquidation authority, the FDIC would place the top-tier U.S. holding company in receivership, keep its operating subsidiaries open and out of insolvency proceedings by transferring them to a new bridge holding company, impose losses on the stockholders and creditors of the holding company in receivership according to their statutory order of priority, and address the problems that led to the institution’s failure.


• | Enforcement Authority — The FRB possesses extensive authorities and powers to regulate and supervise the conduct of Ally’s businesses and operations. If the FRB were to take the position that Ally or any of its subsidiaries have violated any law or commitment or engaged in any unsafe or unsound practice, formal or informal enforcement and other supervisory actions could be taken by the FRB against Ally, its subsidiaries, and institution-affiliated parties (such as directors, officers, and agents). The UDFI and the FDIC have similarly expansive authorities and powers over Ally Bank and its subsidiaries. For example, these governmental authorities could order us to cease and desist from engaging in specified activities or practices or could affirmatively compel us to correct specified violations or practices. Some or all of these government authorities also would have the power, as applicable, to issue administrative orders against us that can be judicially enforced, to direct us to increase capital and liquidity, to limit our dividends and other capital distributions, to restrict or redirect the growth of our assets, businesses, and operations, to assess civil money penalties against us, to remove our officers and directors, to require the divestiture or the retention of assets or entities, to terminate deposit insurance, or to force us into bankruptcy, conservatorship, or receivership. These actions could directly affect not only Ally, its subsidiaries, and institution-affiliated parties but also Ally’s counterparties, stockholders, and creditors and its commitments, arrangements, and other dealings with them.

In addition, the CFPB has broad authorities and powers to enforce federal consumer protection laws involving financial products and services. The CFPB has exercised these authorities and powers through public enforcement actions, lawsuits, and consent orders and through nonpublic enforcement actions. In doing so, the CFPB has generally sought remediation of harm alleged to have been suffered by consumers, civil money penalties, and changes in practices and other conduct.
The SEC, FINRA, the Department of Justice, state attorneys general, and other domestic or foreign government authorities also have an array of means at their disposal to regulate and enforce matters within their jurisdiction that could impact Ally’s businesses and operations.
Basel Capital Framework
The FRB and other U.S. banking agencies have adopted risk-based and leverage capital standards that establish minimum capital-to-asset ratios for BHCs, like Ally, and depository institutions, like Ally Bank.
The risk-based capital ratios are based on a banking organization’s risk-weighted assets (RWAs), which are generally determined under the standardized approach applicable to Ally and Ally Bank by (1) assigning on-balance sheet exposures to broad risk weight categories according to the counterparty or, if relevant, the guarantor or collateral (with higher risk weights assigned to categories of exposures perceived as representing greater risk), and (2) multiplying off-balance sheet exposures by specified credit conversion factors to calculate credit equivalent amounts and assigning those credit equivalent amounts to the relevant risk weight categories. The leverage ratio, in contrast, is based on an institution’s average unweighted on-balance sheet exposures.
Until January 1, 2015, the U.S. risk-based and leverage capital standards applicable to Ally and Ally Bank were based on the Basel I capital accord promulgated by the Basel Committee in 1989 (U.S. Basel I). Ally and Ally Bank were required to maintain, under U.S. Basel I, a minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of Tier 1 capital to RWAs of 4%, a minimum total risk-based capital ratio of total qualifying capital to RWAs of 8%, and a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to average on-balance-sheet exposures of 4%.

Ally Financial Inc. • Form 10-K

In December 2010, the Basel Committee reached an agreement on the global Basel III capital framework, which was designed to increase the quality and quantity of regulatory capital by introducing new risk-based and leverage capital standards. In July 2013, the U.S. banking agencies finalized rules implementing the Basel III capital framework in the United States as well as related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act (U.S. Basel III). U.S. Basel III represents a substantial revision to the previously effective regulatory capital standards for U.S. banking organizations. We became subject to U.S. Basel III on January 1, 2015, although a number of its provisions—including capital buffers and certain regulatory capital deductions—were subject to a phase-in period through December 31, 2018.
Under U.S. Basel III, Ally and Ally Bank must maintain a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%, a minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%, and a minimum total risk-based capital ratio of 8%. In addition to these minimum risk-based capital ratios, Ally and Ally Bank are also subject to a Common Equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of more than 2.5%, which was subject to a phase-in period from January 1, 2016, through December 31, 2018. Failure to maintain the full amount of the buffer would result in restrictions on the ability of Ally and Ally Bank to make capital distributions, including dividend payments and stock repurchases and redemptions, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. U.S. Basel III also subjects Ally and Ally Bank to a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%.
U.S. Basel III also revised the eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments and provided for the phase-out of instruments that had previously been recognized as capital but that do not satisfy these criteria. For example, subject to certain exceptions (e.g., certain debt or equity issued to the U.S. government under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act), trust preferred and other hybrid securities were excluded from a BHC’s Tier 1 capital beginning January 1, 2016. Also, certain items are deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 capital under U.S. Basel III that had not previously been deducted from regulatory capital, and certain other deductions from regulatory capital have been modified. Among other things, U.S. Basel III requires significant investments in the common stock of unconsolidated financial institutions, mortgage servicing assets, and certain deferred tax assets (DTAs) that exceed specified individual and aggregate thresholds to be deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 capital. U.S. Basel III also revised the standardized approach for calculating RWAs by, among other things, modifying certain risk weights and the methods for calculating RWAs for certain types of assets and exposures.
Ally and Ally Bank are subject to the U.S. Basel III standardized approach for counterparty credit risk but not to the U.S. Basel III advanced approaches for credit risk or operational risk. Ally is also not subject to the U.S. market risk capital rule, which applies only to banking organizations with significant trading assets and liabilities.
The capital-to-asset ratios play a central role in prompt corrective action (PCA), which is an enforcement framework used by the U.S. banking agencies to constrain the activities of depository institutions based on their levels of regulatory capital. Five categories have been established using thresholds for the Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, the total risk-based capital ratio, and the leverage ratio: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution, including any payment of a cash dividend or a management fee to its BHC, if the depository institution would become undercapitalized after the distribution. An undercapitalized institution is also subject to growth limitations and must submit and fulfill a capital restoration plan. While BHCs are not subject to the PCA framework, the FRB is empowered to compel a BHC to take measures—such as the execution of financial or performance guarantees—when PCA is required in connection with one of its depository institution subsidiaries. In addition, under FDICIA, only well-capitalized and adequately capitalized institutions may accept brokered deposits, and even adequately capitalized institutions are subject to some restrictions on the rates they may offer for brokered deposits. At December 31, 2018, Ally Bank was well capitalized under the PCA framework.
At December 31, 2018, Ally and Ally Bank were in compliance with their regulatory capital requirements. For an additional discussion of capital adequacy requirements, refer to Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (CECL), which is further described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. CECL introduces a new accounting model to measure credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost, which includes the vast majority of our finance receivables and loan portfolio. Under CECL, credit losses for each of these financial assets are measured based on the total current expected credit losses over the life of the financial asset or group of financial assets. In effect, this means that the financial asset or group of financial assets are presented at the net amount expected to ever be collected. CECL will become effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2020, and represents a significant departure from existing accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), which currently provide for credit losses on these financial assets to be measured as they are incurred. When effective for us on January 1, 2020, CECL is expected to substantially increase our allowance for loan losses with a resulting negative day-one adjustment to equity. In December 2018, the FRB and other U.S. banking agencies approved a final rule to mitigate the impact of CECL on regulatory capital by allowing BHCs and banks, including Ally, to phase in the day-one impact of CECL over a period of three years for regulatory capital purposes. In addition, the FRB announced that although BHCs subject to company-run stress tests as part of CCAR must incorporate CECL beginning in the 2020 cycle, the FRB also further clarified that, in order to reduce uncertainty, it will maintain its current modeling framework for the allowance for loan losses in supervisory stress tests through the 2021 cycle.
Prompted by the enactment of the EGRRCP Act, the FRB and other U.S. banking agencies in the fourth quarter of 2018 issued proposals that would establish risk-based categories for determining capital and liquidity requirements that apply to large U.S. banking organizations. Refer to Holding Company, Financial Holding Company, and Depository Institution Status earlier in this section. In April 2018, the FRB issued a proposal to more closely align forward-looking stress testing results with the FRB’s non-stress regulatory capital requirements for

banking organizations with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets. The proposal would introduce a stress capital buffer based on firm-specific stress test performance, which would effectively replace the non-stress capital conservation buffer. The proposal would also make several changes to the CCAR process, such as eliminating the CCAR quantitative objection, narrowing the set of planned capital actions assumed to occur in the stress scenario, and eliminating the 30% dividend payout ratio as a criterion for heightened scrutiny of a firm’s capital plan.
In December 2017, the Basel Committee approved revisions to the global Basel III capital framework (commonly known as Basel IV), many of which—if adopted in the United States—could heighten regulatory capital standards even more.
At this time, how all of these proposals and revisions will be harmonized and finalized in the United States is not clear or predictable.
Insured Depository Institution Status
Ally Bank is an insured depository institution and, as such, is required to file periodic reports with the FDIC about its financial condition. Total assets of Ally Bank were $159.0 billion and $137.4 billion at December 31, 2018, and 2017, respectively.
Ally Bank’s deposits are insured by the FDIC in the standard insurance amounts per depositor for each account ownership category as prescribed by the FDI Act. Deposit insurance is funded through assessments on Ally Bank and other insured depository institutions, and the FDIC may take action to increase insurance premiums if the DIF is not funded to its regulatory mandated Designated Reserve Ratio (DRR). Currently, the FDIC is required to achieve a DRR of 1.35% by September 30, 2020, and has established a target DRR of 2.0%. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC assesses premiums from each institution based on its average consolidated total assets minus its average tangible equity, while utilizing a scorecard method to determine each institution’s risk to the DIF. The Dodd-Frank Act also requires the FDIC, in setting assessments, to offset the effect of increasing its reserve for the DIF on institutions with consolidated total assets of less than $10 billion. To achieve the mandated DRR consistent with these provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC implemented a rule in 2016 imposing a surcharge of 4.5 basis points on all insured depository institutions with consolidated total assets of $10 billion or more in addition to their regular assessments. Under the rule, the surcharge would cease once a DRR of 1.35% had been achieved or on December 31, 2018, whichever came first. On September 30, 2018, the DRR reached 1.36%, and the surcharge was eliminated.
If an insured depository institution like Ally Bank were to become insolvent or if other specified events were to occur relating to its financial condition or the propriety of its actions, the FDIC may be appointed as conservator or receiver for the institution. In that capacity, the FDIC would have the power to (1) transfer assets and liabilities of the institution to another person or entity without the approval of the institution’s creditors; (2) require that its claims process be followed and to enforce statutory or other limits on damages claimed by the institution’s creditors; (3) enforce the institution’s contracts or leases according to their terms; (4) repudiate or disaffirm the institution’s contracts or leases; (5) seek to reclaim, recover, or recharacterize transfers of the institution’s assets or to exercise control over assets in which the institution may claim an interest; (6) enforce statutory or other injunctions; and (7) exercise a wide range of other rights, powers, and authorities, including those that could impair the rights and interests of all or some of the institution’s creditors. In addition, the administrative expenses of the conservator or receiver could be afforded priority over all or some of the claims of the institution’s creditors, and under the FDI Act, the claims of depositors (including the FDIC as subrogee of depositors) would enjoy priority over the claims of the institution’s unsecured creditors.
Consumer Financial Laws
Ally and Ally Bank are subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the CFPB with respect to federal consumer protection laws involving financial products and services. The Dodd-Frank Act also empowers state attorneys general and other state officials to enforce federal consumer protection laws under specified conditions. Ally and Ally Bank are subject to a host of state consumer protections laws as well.

• | Mortgage Operations — Our mortgage business is subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws, including related judicial and administrative decisions. The federal, state, and local laws to which our mortgage business is subject, among other things, impose licensing obligations and financial requirements; limit the interest rates, finance charges, and other fees that can be charged; regulate the use of credit reports and the reporting of credit information; impose underwriting requirements; regulate marketing techniques and practices; require the safeguarding of nonpublic information about customers; and regulate servicing practices, including in connection with assessments, collection and foreclosure activities, claims handling, and investment and interest payments on escrow accounts.

Through our direct-to-consumer mortgage offering, we offer a variety of jumbo and conforming fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgage products with the assistance of a third-party fulfillment provider. Jumbo mortgage loans are generally held on our balance sheet and are accounted for as held-for-investment. Conforming mortgage loans are generally originated as held-for-sale and then sold to the fulfillment provider, which in turn may sell the loans to the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), or other participants in the secondary mortgage market. The nature and dynamics of this market, however, continue to evolve in ways that are often not clear or predictable. For example, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been in conservatorship since September 2008. While the Federal Housing Finance Agency has published and pursued strategic goals for these government-sponsored enterprises during the conservatorship, their role in the market remains subject to uncertainty. Relatedly, during this same period, Congress has debated comprehensive housing-finance reform, but proposed legislation has yet to be meaningfully advanced.

• | Automotive Lending Business — In March 2013, the CFPB issued guidance about compliance with the fair-lending requirements of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B. The guidance was specific to the practice of indirect automotive finance companies purchasing financing contracts executed between dealers and consumers and paying dealers for the contracts at a discount below the rates dealers charge consumers. In December 2017, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) determined that the CFPB’s guidance constituted a rule under the Congressional Review Act. In May 2018, the guidance was disapproved and nullified under the Congressional Review Act by a joint resolution adopted by Congress and signed by the President.

Asset-backed Securitizations
Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires securitizers of different types of asset-backed securitizations, including transactions backed by residential mortgages, commercial mortgages, and commercial, credit card, and automotive loans, to retain no less than five percent of the credit risk of the assets being securitized, with an exemption for securitizations that are wholly composed of “qualified residential mortgages” (QRMs). Federal regulators issued final rules implementing this Dodd-Frank Act requirement in October 2014. The final rules aligned the definition of QRMs with the CFPB’s definition of “Qualified Mortgage” and also included an exemption for the mortgage-backed securities (MBS) of government-sponsored enterprises. The regulations took effect on February 23, 2015. Compliance was required with respect to securitization transactions backed by residential mortgages beginning December 24, 2015, and with respect to securitization transactions backed by other types of assets beginning December 24, 2016. Ally Bank has complied with the FDIC’s Safe Harbor Rule requiring it to retain five percent risk retention in consumer automotive loan and operating lease securitizations.
Insurance Companies
Certain of our Insurance operations are subject to certain minimum aggregate capital requirements, net asset and dividend restrictions under applicable state and foreign insurance laws, and the rules and regulations promulgated by various U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies. Under various state and foreign insurance regulations, dividend distributions may be made only from statutory unassigned surplus with approvals required from the regulatory authorities for dividends in excess of certain statutory limitations. Our insurance operations are also subject to applicable state laws generally governing insurance companies, as well as laws and regulations for products that are not regulated as insurance, such as vehicle service contracts (VSCs) and guaranteed asset protection (GAP) waivers.
Investments in Ally
Because Ally Bank is an insured depository institution and Ally and IB Finance are BHCs, direct or indirect control of us—whether through the ownership of voting securities, influence over management or policies, or other means—is subject to approvals, conditions, and other restrictions under federal and state laws. Refer to Bank Holding Company, Financial Holding Company, and Depository Institution Status earlier in this section. Investors are responsible for ensuring that they do not, directly or indirectly, acquire control of us in contravention of these laws.
Ally Invest Subsidiaries
Ally Invest Securities LLC (Ally Invest Securities) is registered as a securities broker-dealer with the SEC and in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, is registered with the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board as a municipal securities broker-dealer, and is a member of FINRA, Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), and various other SROs, including BATS BYX Exchange, BATS BZX Exchange, NYSE Arca, and Nasdaq Stock Market. As a result, Ally Invest Securities and its personnel are subject to extensive requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), SEC regulations, SRO rules, and state laws, which collectively cover all aspects of the firm’s securities activities—including sales and trading practices, capital adequacy, recordkeeping, privacy, anti-money laundering, financial and other reporting, supervision, misuse of material nonpublic information, conducting its business in accordance with just and equitable principles of trade, and personnel qualifications. The firm operates as an introducing broker and clears all transactions, including all customer transactions, through a third-party clearing broker-dealer on a fully disclosed basis.
Ally Invest Forex LLC (Ally Invest Forex) is registered with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as an introducing broker and is a member of the National Futures Association (NFA), which is the primary SRO for the U.S. futures industry. It is subject to similarly expansive requirements under the Commodity Exchange Act, CFTC and NFA rules governing introducing brokers and their personnel, and CFTC retail forex rules.
Ally Invest Advisors Inc. (Ally Invest Advisors) is registered as an investment adviser with the SEC. As a result, it is subject to a host of requirements governing investment advisers and their personnel under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, including certain fiduciary and other obligations with respect to its relationships with its investment advisory clients.
Regulators conduct periodic examinations of Ally Invest Securities, Ally Invest Forex, and Ally Invest Advisors, and regularly review reports that the firms are required to submit on an ongoing basis. Violations of relevant regulatory requirements could result in adverse consequences for the firms and their personnel, including censure, penalties and fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, and restriction, suspension or expulsion from the securities industry and other adverse consequences.
Other Laws
Ally is subject to numerous federal, state, and local statutes, regulations, and other laws, and the possibility of violating applicable law presents an ongoing risk to Ally. Some of the other more significant laws to which we are subject include:
10

Ally Financial Inc. • Form 10-K


• | Privacy and Data Security — The GLB Act and related regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to safeguard specified consumer information maintained by them, to provide notice of their privacy practices to consumers in specified circumstances, and to allow consumers to “opt-out” of specified kinds of information sharing with unaffiliated parties. Related regulatory guidance also directs financial institutions to notify consumers in specified cases of unauthorized access to sensitive consumer information. In addition, most states have enacted laws requiring notice of specified cases of unauthorized access to information. In February 2017, the NYDFS adopted expansive cybersecurity regulations that require regulated entities to establish cybersecurity programs and policies, to designate chief information security officers, to comply with notice and reporting obligations, and to take other actions in connection with the security of their information. As these and future laws impose increasingly stringent privacy and data-security obligations on us, our compliance costs and other liabilities could increase substantially.


• | Volcker Rule — Under the Dodd-Frank Act and implementing regulations of the CFTC, FDIC, FRB, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the SEC (the Volcker Rule), insured depository institutions and their affiliates are prohibited from (1) engaging in “proprietary trading,” and (2) investing in or sponsoring certain types of funds (covered funds) subject to certain limited exceptions. The final rules contain exemptions for market-making, hedging, underwriting, trading in U.S. government and agency obligations and also permit certain ownership interests in certain types of funds to be retained. They also permit the offering and sponsoring of funds under certain conditions. In early 2017, the FRB granted us a five-year extension to conform with requirements related to certain covered funds activities. The Volcker Rule imposes significant compliance and reporting obligations on banking entities. The impact of the Volcker Rule is not expected to be material to Ally’s business operations.


• | Fair Lending Laws — The Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, and similar fair-lending laws (collectively, Fair Lending Laws) generally prohibit a creditor from discriminating against an applicant or borrower in any aspect of a credit transaction on the basis of specified characteristics known as “prohibited bases,” such as race, gender, and religion. Creditors are also required under the Fair Lending Laws to follow a number of highly prescriptive rules, including rules requiring credit decisions to be made promptly, notices of adverse actions to be given, and, in the case of mortgage lenders of a certain size, anonymized data and information about mortgage applicants and credit decisions to be gathered and made publicly available. Ally, under the oversight of its Fair and Responsible Banking team, has established a comprehensive fair-lending program that is designed to identify and mitigate fair-lending risk. Because the Fair Lending Laws and interpretations of them continue to evolve, however, Ally remains at risk of being accused of violations.


• | Fair Credit Reporting Act — The Fair Credit Reporting Act regulates the dissemination of credit reports by credit reporting agencies, requires users of credit reports to provide specified notices to the subjects of those reports, imposes standards on the furnishing of information to credit reporting agencies, obligates furnishers to maintain reasonable procedures to deal with the risk of identity theft, addresses the sharing of specified kinds of information with affiliates and third parties, and regulates the use of credit reports to make preapproved offers of credit and insurance to consumers. All of these provisions impose additional regulatory and compliance costs on us and affect our marketing programs.


• | Truth in Lending Act — The Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and Regulation Z, which implements TILA, require lenders to provide borrowers with uniform, understandable information about the terms and conditions in certain credit transactions. These rules apply to Ally and its subsidiaries when they extend credit to consumers and require, in the case of certain mortgage and automotive consumer loans, conspicuous disclosure of the finance charge and annual percentage rate, as applicable. In addition, if an advertisement for credit states specific credit terms, Regulation Z requires that the advertisement state only those terms that actually are or will be arranged or offered by the creditor together with specified notices. The CFPB has issued substantial amendments to the mortgage requirements under Regulation Z, and additional changes are likely in the future. Amendments to Regulation Z and Regulation X, which implements the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, require integrated mortgage loan disclosures to be provided for applications received on or after October 3, 2015. Failure to comply with TILA can result in liability for damages as well as criminal and civil penalties.


• | Sarbanes-Oxley Act — The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 implemented a broad range of corporate governance and accounting measures designed to promote honesty and transparency in corporate America. The principal provisions of the act include, among other things, (1) the creation of an independent accounting oversight board; (2) auditor independence provisions that restrict non-audit services that accountants may provide to their audit clients; (3) additional corporate governance and responsibility measures including the requirement that the principal executive and financial officers certify financial statements; (4) the potential forfeiture of bonuses or other incentive-based compensation and profits from the sale of an issuer’s securities by directors and senior officers in the twelve-month period following initial publication of any financial statements that later require restatement; (5) an increase in the oversight and enhancement of certain requirements relating to audit committees and how they interact with the independent auditors; (6) requirements that audit committee members must be independent and are barred from accepting consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fees from the issuer; (7) requirements that companies disclose whether at least one member of the audit committee is a “financial expert” (as defined by the SEC) and, if not, why the audit committee does not have a financial expert; (8) a prohibition on personal loans to directors and officers, except certain loans made by insured financial institutions, on nonpreferential terms and in compliance with other bank regulatory requirements; (9) disclosure of a code of ethics; (10) requirements that management assess the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and that the independent registered public accounting firm attest to the assessment; and (11) a range of enhanced penalties for fraud and other violations.

• | USA PATRIOT Act/Anti-Money-Laundering Requirements — In 2001, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act (USA PATRIOT Act) was signed into law. Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act amends the Bank Secrecy Act and contains provisions designed to detect and prevent the use of the U.S. financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing activities. The Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act, requires banks, certain other financial institutions, and, in certain cases, BHCs to undertake activities including maintaining an anti-money-laundering program, verifying the identity of clients, monitoring for and reporting on suspicious transactions, reporting on cash transactions exceeding specified thresholds, and responding to certain requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies. We have implemented internal practices, procedures, and controls designed to comply with these anti-money-laundering requirements.


• | Community Reinvestment Act — Under the CRA, a bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the institution, to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income persons and neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions. However, institutions are rated on their performance in meeting the needs of their communities. Ally Bank filed its three-year CRA Strategic Plan with the FRB in October 2016, and received approval in November 2016. In addition, in 2017, Ally Bank received an “Outstanding” rating in its most recent CRA performance evaluation. Failure by Ally Bank to maintain a “Satisfactory” or better rating under the CRA may adversely affect our ability to expand our financial and related activities as an FHC or make acquisitions.

Employees
We had approximately 8,200 and 7,900 employees at December 31, 2018, and 2017, respectively.
