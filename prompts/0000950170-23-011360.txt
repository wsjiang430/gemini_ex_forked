ITEM 1. Business
Company Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the science of ribosome modulation, leveraging both our innovative TURBO-ZM chemistry technology platform and our library of novel aminoglycosides to develop novel oral small molecule Ribosome Modulating Agents (“RMAs”) and Eukaryotic Ribosome Selective Glycosides (“ERSGs”), for the treatment of rare and ultra-rare genetic diseases where patients have point nonsense genetic mutations that result in premature stop codons and less than full length proteins. Nonsense mutations result in premature stop codons in the impacted messenger RNA (“mRNA”) which in turn disrupt protein synthesis from that mRNA leading to less than full length proteins. Patients with these mutations have significantly worse outcomes than with missense mutations.
We have multiple programs in our pipeline including a clinical program for the treatment of Alport syndrome with ELX-02 (subcutaneous delivery), preclinical programs in investigational new drug ("IND") enabling stages in Recessive Dystrophic (“RDEB”) and Junctional Epidermolysis Bullosa (“JEB”) and Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (“FAP”) with ZKN-013, and IND enabling stage program with inhaled delivery of ELX-02 in Class 1 cystic fibrosis ("CF"). We also have various earlier discovery stage programs in CF and oncology. As our programs advance, we plan to actively look to expand our pipeline by seeking new indications in other rare diseases for compounds designed with our platforms. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has granted Fast Track designation for ELX-02 for the treatment of CF patients with nonsense mutations. In addition, the FDA granted ELX-02 Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of CF in July 2020 and, based on the European Medicines Agency’s (“EMA”) positive opinion, the European Commission granted ELX-02 orphan medicinal product designation in September 2018.
In March 2022, we announced our decision to advance ELX-02 delivered subcutaneously for the restoration of collagen IV protein for the treatment of Alport syndrome. Alport syndrome with nonsense mutations is a genetic kidney disorder that occurs in 1 in 50,000 newborns in the United States. It is caused by the loss of one of three collagen IV subtypes. This disease is characterized by blood (hematuria) and protein (proteinuria) in the patient's urine and results in progressive kidney disease, hearing loss, and eye abnormalities. In November 2022, we began a Phase 2 monotherapy clinical trial for ELX-02 for the treatment of Alport syndrome and in February 2023, we announced that the first patients had been enrolled. ELX-02 treatment has demonstrated restoration of full-length protein in multiple preclinical models, including collagen IV and collagen VII in cells, and also clinical activity in our Phase 2 cystic fibrosis trial. In February 2023 we announced that the first patients had been dosed in this Phase 2 trial. We believe our results, previously conducted in vivo studies showing improvement of kidney function with collagen IV restoration and the ability to achieve high kidney drug levels at tolerable doses support the clinical development of ELX-02 in Alport syndrome. This Phase 2 trial is targeting dosing of up to eight Alport syndrome patients with nonsense mutations in the collagen IV (COL4) gene. Patients will be dosed for two months with a three month follow-up. In addition to the primary endpoint of safety, the key secondary efficacy endpoint of proteinuria will be measured every two weeks. For eligible patients, induction of the COL IV protein will also be measured at the end of two months. Topline results are expected in the first half of 2023.
 We are also advancing ZKN-013 as an oral agent for the treatment of RDEB/JEB and FAP patients with nonsense mutations. RDEB and JEB are rare skin diseases characterized by mutations in Collagen VII (RDEB) and LAMB3(JEB) proteins. We estimate that there are approximately 4,000 patients with nonsense mutations in these diseases in the major markets of the United States, Japan, and western Europe. Patients suffer from severe skin bruising, wounds and internal lesions resulting in increased risk of skin cancer and severe malnourishment. FAP patients have mutations in the APC gene that result in a proliferation of polyps in the colon that if untreated can lead to colon and other related cancers. There are currently no approved disease modifying therapies for these diseases. ZKN-013 has demonstrated robust collagen VII restoration in patient cells comparable to 5-10% of protein restoration across a range of mutations. We have also seen in two separate studies, that treatment of APCMin mice, a validated model for evaluating potential treatment effects in FAP patients, with ZKN-013 for eight weeks reduced polyp number, polyp size and meaningfully improved survival. On March 24, 2023, we submitted an IND for ZKN-013 for the treatment of RDEB.
 In September 2022, in consultation with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (“CFF”), we terminated the development of ELX-02 delivered subcutaneously, for the treatment of CF patients with at least one nonsense (“Class 1 CF”) mutation. This decision was made after our Phase 2 trial of ELX-02 in combination with ivacaftor, an approved drug currently marketed for the treatment of certain CF patients under the trade name “Kalydeco”, did

not meet the secondary efficacy endpoint of reduction from baseline in sweat chloride concentration (SCC) or improvement from baseline in percent forced expiratory volume (FEV1). Encouragingly, we continued to see strong evidence of biological activity similar to that in our previously completed Phase 2 study that reported in November 2021 a reduction in sweat chloride concentration from baseline after one week of treatment with ELX-02. We believe that the lack of statistically significant clinical benefit in Class 1 CF patients was due to drug concentration in the lung tissue being significantly below that required for effect consistent with our preclinical studies. ELX-02 was well tolerated in the Phase 2 trial with no drug related adverse events even at the clinical dose of 1.5mg/kg. Going forward, we plan to only develop ELX-02 as an inhaled therapy for Class 1 CF patients because the achievable drug concentrations are more than one-hundred times higher in the lung tissue than when given subcutaneously. We have completed the IND enabling studies for inhaled ELX-02 in Class 1 CF but further clinical development is contingent upon funding from the CFF.
Acquisition of Zikani Therapeutics, Inc.
 On April 1, 2021, the Company acquired Zikani Therapeutics, Inc. (“Zikani” and such acquisition, the “Zikani Merger”), a company in preclinical development and engaged in the science of ribosome modulation, leveraging its innovative TURBO-ZMTM chemistry technology platform to develop novel RMAs as potential therapeutics for diseases with limited treatment options. The TURBO-ZMTM platform is designed to enable rapid synthesis of novel compounds that can be optimized to modulate the ribosome in a disease specific manner. The TURBO-ZMTM synthetic chemistry platform can design oral novel macrolide-based small molecules that are potent oral modulators with favorable therapeutic indices. Macrolides are antibiotics that inhibit protein synthesis in bacteria.
Our Technology
We are working to unlock the potential of the ribosome to transform genetic diseases. Ribosomes form the translation machinery that generates functional proteins from genetic sequences; modulating the ribosome subunits provides a therapeutic approach to addressing a number of diseases. We are focused on modulating the ribosome to address two specific defects: (1) nonsense mutations implicated in many rare diseases and (2) ribosomal mutations driving cancer.
We are using our TURBO-ZM chemistry technology platform and our library of novel aminoglycosides to develop novel small molecule RMAs and ERSGs, that are uniquely positioned to correct both nonsense mutations and ribosomal mutations. Clinical and preclinical results for the ability of macrolide and aminoglycoside antibiotics to restore proteins in nonsense mutations have been shown in more than 36 rare diseases. These molecules have also shown an ability to selectively stop protein translation. However, significant safety, tolerability and delivery limitations have prevented further development for human diseases. Our RMA and ERSG molecules are designed to be safer, more potent, and easier to deliver than traditional macrolide and aminoglycoside antibiotics and thus fulfill their clinical promise.
Nonsense mutations
Nonsense mutations, also known as premature termination or stop codons, are single point mutations within the DNA sequence which are either inherited or acquired that result in the premature termination of the translational process leading to truncated or absent proteins. The ribosome manufactures protein one amino acid at a time designated by a series of three nucleotides, called a codon. A nonsense mutation changes the codon for an amino acid into the codon for a “STOP” signal leading to the formation of a truncated protein with loss of function.
We believe that the segment of patients with diagnosed nonsense mutations on one or both alleles represents a high unmet medical need as there are currently no approved therapeutics targeting the impairment caused by these mutations. Nonsense mutations are involved in a large number of genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis, Alport, Polycystic Kidney disease, RDEB, JEB, and FAP. According to the Human Gene Mutation Database, nonsense mutations account for approximately 12% of patients with a given genetic disease. The disease phenotypes caused by nonsense mutations are frequently more severe than those caused by other kinds of mutations because these mutations often lead to a complete loss of protein production or function. In general, these diseases do not have specific therapies beyond symptomatic and palliative interventions.
Read-through of nonsense mutations is a naturally occurring process that can be attributed to the redundancy in the three-nucleotide codon structure. During read-through, either the typical healthy or a near-cognate substitute amino acid occurs resulting in the continuation of translation. Our RMAs and ERSGs (like ELX-02) are designed to

enhance the likelihood of readthrough by modulating the ribosome. Multiple compounds within our RMA and ERSG library are designed to demonstrate the readthrough of the premature stop codon.
 Drivers of ribosomal mutations in cancer
Loss or gain of ribosomal proteins and ribosome modifying factors in cancer can lead to cancer progression through translation of oncogenic proteins. These altered ribosomes are structurally distinct and can be selectively targeted by rationally designed macrolides designed with the TURBO-ZM platform. Active screening of compounds has identified several leads and hits which have shown promising results in colon cancer and small cell lung cancer patient organoids characterized by over expression of cMYC.
Current Data Supporting the Potential Mechanism of Action of ELX-02
ELX-02 is a novel investigational ERSG designed based on aminoglycoside antibiotics, such as gentamicin, with increased selectivity for the eukaryotic ribosome. The early observations of eukaryotic read-through activity were made in patients treated with aminoglycosides due to bacterial infections. However, despite the promising clinical observations of read-through activity, the use of aminoglycoside antibiotics as a read-through therapy is restricted since aminoglycosides may cause damage to the kidney and ear after prolonged administration. The effect of aminoglycoside antibiotics on the hair cells of the ear and the proximal tubular cells of the kidney may be attributed, in part, to the inhibition of mitochondrial protein production in these cells. Due to the markedly decreased affinity for the prokaryotic and mitochondrial ribosomes, ERSG compounds have little of the antibiotic activity associated with aminoglycosides. When compared in laboratory tests to gentamicin (a classic aminoglycoside antibiotic), ELX-02 showed a 100-fold lower antibacterial activity and nine-fold higher read-through activity for nonsense mutations. We believe this result was attributable to higher selectivity towards the eukaryotic cytoplasmic ribosome. Because ERSGs are selective for the eukaryotic cytoplasmic ribosome and have markedly decreased affinity for the mitochondrial ribosome, we believe ERSGs have the potential to show an acceptable safety and tolerability profile for chronic use. We believe that our library of ERSG compounds has the potential to show improved read-through activity with a reduced potential for impairment of the mitochondrial ribosome and may have an improved safety profile.
We evaluated a subset of our compounds in the cell by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (“qPCR”), western blot protein analysis and for proper localization of the restored protein by immunofluorescence. Consistent with our overall hypothesis, we have found that molecules in our library significantly increase both the mRNA (dose-dependent increases of 30-fold over vehicle control) and protein of interest (increased normalized full-length protein 4.7-fold over vehicle control) as well as the protein’s proper sub-cellular localization. In addition to supporting our overall mechanism of action hypothesis, these studies have enabled us to develop a robust (z’ factor = 0.88), high-throughput assay within this system to further evaluate compound-mediated read-through across our library.
Scope of Activities
 We are currently focused on the following program areas.
 Alport Syndrome with Nonsense Mutations
Alport syndrome is a major inherited kidney diseases that affects an estimated 155,000 to 215,000 patients worldwide and results from mutations in the COL4 gene which cause truncated or missense COLIV proteins. It is estimated that 85% of patients are X-linked and 15% have recessive mutations
 Approximately 6% of Alport patients carry a nonsense mutation on the COL4 gene and have truncated COLIV proteins. More than 70 nonsense mutations have been described. Alport is a progressive disease caused by a fragile (or none) base membrane of the glomeruli due to deficiency in COLIV protein. Alport patients have high levels of blood (Hematuria) and proteins (Proteinuria) in the urine. This in turn causes fibrosis, loss of kidney function (eGFR) and ultimately kidney failure. There are no approved treatments for Alport and 50% of patients with nonsense mutations lose their kidney function by the time they are 18 years old.
We are evaluating the treatment effect of ELX-02 delivered subcutaneously in a Phase 2 trial in Alport Patients. This Phase 2 trial is targeting dosing of up to eight Alport syndrome patients with nonsense mutations in the COL4 gene. Patients will be dosed for two months with a three-month follow-up. In addition to the primary endpoint of safety, the key secondary efficacy endpoint of proteinuria will be measured every two weeks. For eligible patients, induction of COL IV will also be measured at the end of two months. Topline results are expected in the first half of 2023.
Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (“RDEB”) and Junctional Epidermolysis Bullosa (“JEB”)
 Epidermolysis bullosa (“EB”) is a group of rare inherited skin disorders that cause the skin to become very fragile. Any trauma or friction to the skin can cause painful blisters. RDEB and JEB are the two main types of EB.
RDEB is caused by mutations in the COL7A1 gene that codes for COL7A1 protein. The COL7A1 gene is involved in coding for the collagen that helps attach the epidermis to underlying layers of skin. We are targeting nonsense mutations in COL7A1. These represent approximately 30-40% of all mutations in COL7A1.
 JEB is most commonly caused by mutations in the LAMA3, LAMB3 and LAMC2 genes. The LAMA3, LAMB3, and LAMC2 genes are involved in coding for a protein that plays an important role in strengthening and stabilizing the skin. We are targeting nonsense mutations in LAMB3 genes that represent approximately 70% of all mutations.
Infants are typically born with widespread blistering and areas of missing skin, often caused by trauma during birth. Most RDEB patients develop skin cancer by age 35 and the average mortality of patients with JEB is 18 months. RDEB affects approximately 4,000 patients worldwide with nonsense mutations and there are no approved treatments; management is palliative.
ZKN-013 is our lead TURBO-ZM based molecule in our program to address nonsense mutations in RDEB/JEB.
Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (“FAP”)
FAP is caused by a mutation in the APC gene coding for APC protein, which acts as a tumor suppressor and keeps cells from growing too fast or in an uncontrolled way. It is characterized by polyps developing in subjects as young as in their teens. These polyps have a high propensity for progression to cancer. Hence patients undergo prophylactic colectomy in adolescence or early adulthood to prevent colorectal cancer development.
 Our program to address FAP includes TURBO-ZM based RMAs including ZKN-013 and additional undisclosed compounds.
 Research and Development Programs
Our pipeline of programs is summarized in the following table:
 
Development Program for ELX-02 for the Treatment of Alport Syndrome
 In March 2022, we announced our decision to advance ELX-02 delivered subcutaneously for the restoration of the COL IV protein for the treatment of Alport syndrome, a rare kidney disease, with nonsense mutations, a rare kidney disease. In November 2022, we began a Phase 2 monotherapy clinical trial for ELX-02 for the treatment of Alport syndrome and in January 2023, we announced that the first patients had been enrolled and in February 2023 we announced that the first patients had been dosed. Alport syndrome with nonsense mutations is a genetic kidney disorder that occurs in 1 in 50,000 newborns in the United States. It is caused by the loss of one of three collagen IV subtypes. This disease is characterized by blood (hematuria) and protein (proteinuria) in the patient's urine, and results in progressive kidney disease, hearing loss, and eye abnormalities. ELX-02 treatment has demonstrated restoration of full-length protein in multiple preclinical models, including collagen IV and collagen VII in cells, and also clinical activity in our Phase 2 cystic fibrosis trial. We believe our results, previously conducted in vivo studies

showing improvement of kidney function with collagen IV restoration and the ability to achieve high kidney drug levels at tolerable doses support the clinical development of ELX-02 in Alport syndrome. In preclinical studies, significant improvement in kidney function and survival has been seen in Alport mice that lack full length Collagen IV proteins at very low protein levels when treated with protein restoration therapies. ELX-02 has demonstrated 6 to 15% collagen IV restoration in cellular systems. ELX-02 treatment in mice with another rare kidney disease, cystinosis, also resulted in a reduction of cystine levels, a marker for disease improvement. ELX-02 drug levels in the kidney are approximately 50-fold higher than in the plasma. As a result, at our targeted dose of 0.75mg/kg, which is half of the dose previously given to patients in our Phase 2 CF trial with ELX-02 and ivacaftor, we believe that ELX-02 levels in the kidney could result in protein restoration levels that may be sufficient to reduce proteinuria in Alport patients, a key endpoint for kidney function improvement. This Phase 2 trial is targeting dosing of up to eight Alport syndrome patients with nonsense mutations in the COL4 gene. Patients will be dosed for two months with a three month follow-up. In addition to the primary endpoint of safety, the key secondary efficacy endpoint of proteinuria will be measured every two weeks. For eligible patients, induction of COL IV will also be measured at the end of two months. Topline results are expected in the first half of 2023 and we plan to advance to a pivotal clinical trial if we observe a significant improvement in our efficacy endpoint of proteinuria reduction in the kidney.
 ZKN-013 - RDEB and JEB
 ZKN-013 is our lead TURBO-ZM based molecule in our program to address nonsense mutations in RDEB/JEB. Existing third-party data has paved the way for our development program, including third-party clinical studies evaluating gentamicin. Patients receiving gentamicin in these studies had an approximate 70% increase in wound closure and an approximate 70% decrease in blistering events.
Preclinical results support the potential for RMAs to restore functional collagen protein at levels comparable to high-dose gentamicin. IND-enabling pre-clinical studies have been completed and on March 24, 2023 we filed an IND for ZKN-013 for the treatment of RDEB.
FAP
 ZKN-013 has also shown promising in vivo and in vitro preclinical activity in FAP. Existing third-party data has paved the way for our development program, including results from third-party clinical studies evaluating erythromycin, a macrolide antibiotic and Celecoxib. Patients receiving erythromycin in these studies had an approximate 50% reduction in polyp number and polyp burden (area of polyps) after at 12 months after 6 months 400mg/day once daily Celecoxib showed an approximate 30% reduction (vs. those treated with placebo) in polyp number and size after 6 months of treatment.
In a pre-clinical study, evaluating the activity of ZKN-013 in mice models known as APCmin, that are considered to be representative of FAP patients, ZKN-013 showed a 40% reduction in polyp number (vs. untreated mice), an approximately 50% reduction in polyp burden (vs. untreated mice) and 50% survival benefit (vs. untreated mice). We believe that these results support the further development of ZKN-013 for the treatment of FAP patients. We continue to evaluate ZKN-013 and other RMAs for their potential to treat FAP patients with nonsense mutations.
ELX-02 – Class 1 CF Program
  In September 2022, in consultation with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (“CFF”), we terminated the development of ELX-02 delivered subcutaneously, for the treatment CF patients with at least one nonsense (“Class 1 CF”) mutations. This decision was made after our Phase 2 trial of ELX-02 in combination with ivacaftor, an approved drug currently marketed for the treatment of certain CF patients under the trade name “Kalydeco”, did not meet the secondary efficacy endpoint of reduction from baseline in sweat chloride concentration (SCC) or improvement from baseline in percent forced expiratory volume (FEV1). Encouragingly, we continued to see strong evidence of biological activity similar to that in our previously completed Phase 2 study that reported in November 2021 a reduction in sweat chloride concentration from baseline after one week of treatment with ELX-02. We believe that the lack of statistically significant clinical benefit in Class 1 CF patients was due to drug concentration in the lung tissue being significantly below that required for effect consistent with our preclinical studies. ELX-02 was well tolerated in the Phase 2 trial with no drug related adverse events even at the clinical dose of 1.5mg/kg.
Going forward, we plan to only develop ELX-02 as an inhaled therapy for Class 1 CF patients because the achievable drug concentrations are more than one-hundred times higher in the lung tissue than when given subcutaneously. We have completed the IND enabling studies for inhaled ELX-02 in Class 1 CF but further clinical development is contingent upon funding from the CFF.

Ongoing earlier stage discovery programs with our library of RMAs and ERSGs
 We continue to explore the potential of our libraries of RMAs and ESRGs, while expanding our RMA library using our TURBO-ZMTM platform, to expand into other rare diseases and cancers in our earlier stage discovery efforts. We have observed promising early in vitro and in vivo results in various cell line and animal cancer models that support our current efforts.
Intellectual Property
 Patent Portfolio
Our licensed and owned patent portfolio includes patents and applications relating to our lead compound, ELX-02 (formerly known as NB124), and over 40 other read-through inducing compounds, as well as methods of making and using these compounds. Each of our patent families is described briefly below.
 With regard to ELX-02, our primary composition of matter coverage derives from a first patent family that we exclusively license under the Research and License Agreement (the “Technion Agreement”) with Technion Institute for Research and Development Ltd. (“TRDF”) dated August 29, 2013. As of December 31, 2022, this family included issued patents in the United States, Europe, Canada, Hong Kong, India, Israel, and Japan, and a pending application in the United States and Israel. Issued patents in this family have claims directed to ELX-02 and other read-through inducing compounds, as well as claims directed to pharmaceutical compositions of the disclosed compounds and methods of using the compounds and compositions to treat genetic disorders associated with premature stop codon mutations including cystic fibrosis, neophropathic cystinosis, DMD, ataxia-telangiectasia, Hurler syndrome, hemophilia A and B, Usher Syndrome, and Tay-Sachs. Patents that have issued or which may issue in the future from this family are currently expected to expire in 2031, not including any extensions of term for which we may be eligible and that we may be granted. A second patent family licensed under the Research and License Agreement with TRDF includes one issued U.S. patent with claims directed to the use of ELX-02 and other read-through inducing compounds to treat Rett syndrome.
 We own two patent families that may provide additional protection for specific methods of using or manufacturing ELX-02 beyond the anticipated expiration date of the primary composition of matter patents.
 The first of these families is directed to methods for large-scale synthesis of ELX-02 and other read-through inducing compounds. As of December 31, 2022, this family included issued patents in the United States, Australia, Israel, India, and Japan and pending applications in the United States, Europe, Brazil, Canada, China Hong Kong, and India. Patents that have issued or which may issue in the future from this family are currently expected to expire in 2038, not including any extensions of term for which we may be eligible that we may be granted.
 The second family is directed to methods of using ELX-02 and other read-through inducing compounds to treat various ocular conditions associated with nonsense mutations, including retinitis pigmentosa, Usher Syndrome, Stickler Syndrome, aniridia, Leber congenital amaurosis, and choroideremia. As of December 31, 2022, this family includes pending applications in the United States, Europe, Australia, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, and South Korea. Any patents issuing from this family are currently expected to expire in 2039, not including any extensions of term for which we may be eligible and that we may be granted.
 Three additional patent families licensed under the Research and License Agreement with TRDF are directed to additional read-through inducing compounds.
The first of these families includes claims directed to ELX-03 (formerly known as NB84) and other read-through inducing compounds, as well as claims directed to pharmaceutical compositions and methods of using the compounds and compositions to treat genetic disorders including cystic fibrosis, DMD, ataxia-telangiectasia, Hurler syndrome, hemophilia A, hemophilia B, Usher Syndrome, and Tay-Sachs.

Patents that have issued or which may issue in the future from this family are currently expected to expire in 2038, not including any extensions of term for which we may be eligible and that we may be granted.
 Our licensed and owned patent portfolio also includes patents and applications relating to TURBO-ZMTM compounds that can be optimized to modulate the ribosome in a disease specific manner. The TURBO-ZMTM compounds are macrolides. Most commonly known macrolides are antibiotics such as azithromycin, erythromycin and clarithromycin that are delivered orally and have favorable safety profiles that have been shown to inhibit protein synthesis in bacteria. Until Zikani’s TURBO-ZMTM chemistry technology, macrolides were only made semi-synthetically which limited their use to antibiotics.
We have licensed four patent families from the President and Fellows of Harvard College ("Harvard") under the license agreement dated February 10, 2015, and subsequently amended and restated on March 31, 2020, claiming macrolides as well as methods of making and using these macrolides. Patents issuing from these families are expected to expire in 2034, 2035 and 2036, respectively, not including any extensions of term for which we may be eligible and that we may be granted.
We jointly own three patent families with Harvard claiming other macrolides as well as methods of making and using these macrolides. These families include pending applications in the United States, Europe, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, and South Korea. Any patents issuing from this family are currently expected to expire in 2038 and 2039, respectively, not including any extensions of term for which we may be eligible and that we may be granted. One of these patent families includes claims directed to ZKN-013, our lead TURBO-ZMTM compound.
Patent Term Extension
 The term of a U.S. patent is 20 years from its earliest effective filing date, assuming all maintenance fees are paid, the patent has not been terminally disclaimed, and the patent has not been invalidated through administrative and/or court proceedings. The term of foreign patents varies but is generally also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. In certain instances, the term of U.S. and certain foreign patents may be extended.
 In the United States, patent term may be extended in certain instances by patent term adjustment (“PTA”), which compensates for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office during examination of the patent. We have received a PTA for one of our exclusively licensed patents relating to ELX-01 and other related read-through inducing compounds, extending the expiration date of that patent from 2027 to 2028. However, we do not know whether any PTA will be granted for any of our future patents.
 For pharmaceutical products that have received FDA approval, the term of a U.S. patent covering the approved product, a method of manufacturing the approved product, or an approved method of use of the product may be extended under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act, in certain instances if specific statutory and regulatory requirements are satisfied. The Hatch-Waxman Act provides for a patent term extension, or PTE, of up to five years as compensation for effective patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. PTE is only available for the first approval of a particular product, the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years from the date of FDA approval, and only one patent may be extended for a particular regulatory review period. In the EU, a similar mechanism exists for extending patent term up to five years through the grant of a Supplementary Protection Certificate (“SPC”) following European Medicines Agency (the “EMA”) approval. Similar regulatory extensions are available or may be available in the future in other jurisdictions. If and when ELX-02 or other of our read-through inducing compounds are approved by the FDA, EMA, or other foreign regulatory authorities, we will apply for these and other patent term extensions on patents covering the approved products, methods of use, or methods of manufacture if the patents are eligible for such extension. However, we cannot provide any assurance that such extensions will be granted for any of our currently issued or future patents.
 Trade Secrets and Know-How
 With respect to our ERSG-based technology platform, we primarily rely on trade secrets and know-how to protect the proprietary nature of our platform. However, trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees,

consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data, know-how and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
License Agreements
Research and License Agreement with Technion Research and Development Foundation Ltd. ("TRDF")
On August 29, 2013, we entered into the Technion Agreement with TRDF, which was further amended and addended to reflect, among other things, the assignment of patents and extension of research periods, with respect to certain technology relating to aminoglycosides and the redesign of aminoglycosides for the treatment of human genetic diseases caused by premature stop mutations and further results of the research of the technology, in order to develop and commercialize products based on such technology. The Technion Agreement provides us with an exclusive, worldwide, non-transferrable license, with a right to grant sublicenses, and royalty-bearing licenses to the TRDF inventions, TRDF patent rights, TRDF’s interest in the joint inventions and joint patent rights, and certain materials and research results owned by TRDF, solely with respect to products in the field of prevention, diagnosis or treatment of any human disease or condition therefor. In return for the license we will pay TRDF (i) milestone payments with respect to each licensed product upon the achievement of certain pre-defined goals by us or one of our sublicensees as follows: $100,000 upon first dosing of a patient in a Phase 2 clinical study (which we paid to TRDF in 2020 for ELX-02); $1,000,000 upon first dosing of a patient in a pivotal study; and $5,000,000 upon first filing of a new drug application (NDA); (ii) certain royalties in the low- to mid-single-digit percentages of all net sales (subject to change in the case of (a) sublicensing to a big pharmaceutical or biotechnology company, or (b) payment of royalties to third parties, or (c) commercialization by a third party of an authorized generic to a licensed product); and (iii) a low- to mid-double-digit percentage of any non-royalty sublicense income. In addition to the milestone payments, we undertook to annually fund the research activities under the license, currently in the estimated annual amount of $0.1 million per year. The Technion Agreement further provides TRDF with an additional pre-emptive right, in force until the first exit event, to invest an amount equal to up to 5% of the amount contemplated to be raised in a proposed investment. TRDF is also entitled, until the closing of an exit event, to appoint an observer to the board under certain restrictions such as confidentiality or conflict of interest. Furthermore, we will reimburse TRDF for all patent filing expenses as of the effective date of the Technion Agreement and for past patent filing expenses in the amount of several hundred thousand New Israeli Shekels upon the occurrence of certain conditions.
Under the Technion Agreement, TRDF reserved the right, for itself, the Technion and other not-for-profit research organizations to utilize the technology solely for educational purposes. Furthermore, Professor Baasov, the principal investigator, had ongoing research programs involving covered compounds (as defined in the agreement) that are being funded by the National Institute of Health in the U.S., or the NIH, under sub-awards from the University of Alabama and the University of Michigan, and it is possible that such research programs will overlap with the research conducted according to the terms of our agreement. In the case of any such overlap, the work product of such research will be subject to the terms and conditions of such sub-awards, including certain obligations under 35 U.S.C. §§ 200-212 or 37 C.F.R. § 401 et seq. in the case of any TRDF inventions that are also “subject invention” as defined in 35 U.S.C. § 201.
The license agreement shall continue in full force and effect on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the expiration of all payment obligations for any such licensed product as described above. Upon the expiration, we will have a fully paid-up, worldwide non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable license (with the right to grant sublicenses) to use certain materials and the research results, solely with respect to products in the field of prevention, diagnosis or treatment of any human disease or condition.
License Agreement between Zikani and President and Fellows of Harvard College ("Harvard")
 On February 10, 2015, Zikani entered into an agreement to license certain patent rights owned by Harvard. This license agreement was subsequently amended and restated on March 31, 2020. Harvard is entitled to receive clinical and regulatory milestone payments totaling up to $3.6 million in the aggregate per licensed product approved in the United States, European Union, and Japan. The Company is also obligated to make additional royalty payments to Harvard upon the occurrence of certain sales milestones per licensed product up to a mid-single digit royalty percentage. The royalty percentage depends on the product and whether such licensed product is

covered by a valid claim within the certain patent rights that the Company licenses from Harvard. Further, the Company may sub license the patent rights and any income, with the Company obligated to remit to Harvard fees ranging from 20% to 30% of such sublicense income up to the achievement of certain milestone events. There were no royalties recorded in 2022 or 2021.
Under this agreement, the Company has an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license under Harvard’s interest in the Patent Rights, and a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license under Harvard’s interest in the Harvard Know-How, solely to develop, make, have made, use, offer for sale, sell, have sold and import and export licensed products solely within the field.
 Harvard retains the right, for itself and for other not-for-profit research organizations, to practice the patent rights within the scope of the license granted above, solely for non-commercial research, educational and scholarly purposes; provided, that, nothing herein shall be construed as permitting Harvard or any such not-for-profit research organization to grant any rights to any third party, including any for-profit sponsor, to practice or exploit any of the patent rights for any commercial purpose that would be inconsistent with the terms of the exclusive license of the patent rights, including any right to develop, manufacture, market or sell licensed products for use in the field; and the United States federal government retains rights in the patent rights pursuant to 35 U.S.C. §§ 200-212 and 37 C.F.R. § 401 et seq., and any right granted in this agreement greater than that permitted under 35 U.S.C. §§ 200-212 or 37 C.F.R. § 401 et seq. will be deemed modified.
Manufacturing
 ELX-02 is designed to be manufactured under current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) conditions and is formulated as a sterile frozen liquid or lyophilized powder in glass vials. ELX-02 is designed to be administered by parenteral subcutaneous injection after appropriate dilution or reconstitution, as required.
 We do not own or operate manufacturing or distribution facilities for the production of clinical quantities of ELX-02 or for our other preclinical product candidates. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture, packaging, labeling and distribution of clinical supplies of ELX-02 as well as any other candidate that we may develop.
We engage separate manufacturers for drug substance and drug product. We have a relationship with a manufacturer that is capable of providing fill and finish services for our clinical product at the current scale. To support later clinical trials, transfer of the manufacturing and release to a manufacturer with higher lot scale capacity will be needed for our clinical product.
All of our current drug candidates are organic compounds of low molecular weight. We have selected our lead compounds not only on the basis of their potential efficacy and safety but also for their ease of synthesis and reasonable cost of their starting materials. ELX-02 is manufactured in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes. We currently use a single third-party manufacturing source for the production of a key raw material, produced by bacterial fermentation; however, we have identified several other acceptable sources for this production.
We currently obtain clinical supplies of ELX-02 from third-party manufacturers pursuant to agreements that include specific supply timelines and volume expectations. If a manufacturer should become unavailable to us for any reason, we would seek to obtain supply from another manufacturer engaged by us for the applicable product or service. In the event that we were unable to procure the applicable supply from a currently qualified manufacturer, we believe that there are a number of potential replacements for each of our outsourced services; however, we would likely experience delays in our ability to supply ELX-02 in advancing our clinical trials while we identify and qualify replacement suppliers.
Government Regulation
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of drug products. A new drug must be approved by the FDA through the New Drug Application (“NDA”) process before it may be legally marketed in the United States. We, along with any third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval of our products and product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Drug Development Process
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 •completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”) requirements and other applicable regulations;
 •submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
 •approval by an independent Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) or ethics committee at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices (“GCPs”) to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;
 •preparation of and submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal trials;
 •a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the application for review
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCPs; and
 •FDA review and approval of the NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
 The preclinical developmental stage generally involves laboratory evaluations of chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate the product candidate’s toxicity in animals, in an effort to support subsequent clinical testing. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations, where applicable.
 Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, the trial sponsor must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product candidate, chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information, and any available human data or literature to support the use of the product candidate. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring subject safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. While the IND is active, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.


Furthermore, an independent IRB or ethics committee for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site, and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study, and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries, including clinicaltrials.gov.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 •Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. 
 •Phase 2: The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
 •Phase 3: The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
 In some cases, the FDA may require, or sponsors may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval, and may be used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
In addition, during the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meetings at the end of the Phase 2 trial to discuss Phase 2 clinical results and present plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 U.S. Review and Approval Process
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, preclinical and other non-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by independent investigators. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees, unless a waiver or exemption applies.

In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”) requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, NDAs and supplements must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation.
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once filed, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the filing date to complete a standard review of an NDA for a drug that is a new molecular entity. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is sufficient to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity.
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs.
After the FDA evaluates an NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”). An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the NDA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the CRL without first conducting required inspections and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the CRL, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the NDA in condition for approval, including requests for new clinical studies or additional information or clarification. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a medicine and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. The FDA may also require one or more Phase 4 post- market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
 The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. For example, the Fast Track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing product candidates that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a Fast Track product candidate has

opportunities for more frequent interactions with the applicable FDA review team during development and, once an NDA is submitted, the product candidate may be eligible for priority review. A Fast Track product candidate may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
A product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product candidate can receive Breakthrough Therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of senior managers.
 Any marketing application for a drug submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product candidate with a Fast Track designation and/or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as priority review and accelerated approval. An NDA is eligible for priority review if the product candidate is designed to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available alternatives for such disease or condition. For new-molecular-entity NDAs, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date, as opposed to ten months under standard review.
 Additionally, product candidates studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. Products receiving accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required post-marketing studies in a timely manner or if such studies fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, priority review, and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
 Orphan drug designation and exclusivity
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 individuals in the United States and when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.


If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular active ingredient for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA, to market the same drug for the same disease or condition for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.
 A designated orphan drug many not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or, as noted above, if a second applicant demonstrates that its product is clinically superior to the approved product with orphan exclusivity or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
 Post-approval Requirements
 Drug products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 •restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
 •fines, warning letters, or untitled letters;
 •clinical holds on clinical studies;
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
 •consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
 •mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;


•the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
 The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drug products. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe, in their independent professional medical judgment, legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA-approved labelling.
 Marketing Exclusivity
 Market exclusivity provisions authorized under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) or an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2) (505(b)(2) NDA) submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder.
 The FDCA alternatively provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to any preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of marketing exclusivity available in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity attached to another period of exclusivity if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA. The issuance of a written request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials.
Foreign Regulation
 We conduct clinical trials and plan to market our future products in numerous jurisdictions outside the U.S. Most of these jurisdictions have clinical trial, product approval and post-approval regulatory processes that are similar in principle to those in the U.S. Thus, whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the E.U., before we can commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
 Under the E.U. regulatory system, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for orphan medicines, medicines produced by biotechnology, and those medicines intended to treat AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, or diabetes, and optional for those medicines that are highly innovative, provides for the grant of a single

marketing authorization that is valid for all E.U. member states. In addition to the centralized procedure, the E.U. also has a nationalized procedure, which requires a separate application to and approval determination by each country; a decentralized procedure, whereby applicants submit identical applications to several countries and receive simultaneous approval; and a mutual recognition procedure, where applicants submit an application to one country for review and other countries may accept or reject the initial decision.
 Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
  Although we currently do not have any products on the market, we are and, upon approval and commercialization, will be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. In the United States, such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, price reporting, and transparency laws and regulations regarding payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and other licensed healthcare professionals.
  The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing, or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances.
  The federal False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act.
  The U.S. federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), also created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. Similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
  Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) annually report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain non-physician practitioners (physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse midwives) and teaching hospitals, certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.

 Violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us may result in significant penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of operations.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 Sales of any pharmaceutical product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any newly approved product, particularly for gene therapy products where the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) and other third-party payors in the United States have not yet established a uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement. Therefore, decisions. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. As a result, the coverage determination process can require manufacturers to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of a product to each payor separately and can be a time-consuming process, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization.
 In addition, third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for pharmaceutical products and services. The U.S. government and state legislatures have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Third-party payors are more and more challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical products, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product.
 In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of us placing the medicinal product on the market. Pharmaceutical products may face competition from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products and may also compete with imported foreign products. Furthermore, there is no assurance that a product will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be established even if coverage is available or that the third-party payors’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect the ability for manufacturers to sell products profitably.
Healthcare Reform
  A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products and services, implementing reductions in government healthcare programs and other healthcare funding and applying new payment methodologies. For example, in March 2010, the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, was enacted, which affected existing government healthcare programs and resulted in the development of new programs. Among the ACA’s provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical industry, in addition to those otherwise described above, are the following:
 
•an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs;


•an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively, and a cap on the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price, or AMP;
 •a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must now agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
 •extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
 •expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals, including individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
 •expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program; and
 •a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
  Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order initiating a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare. It is unclear how other healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration, if any, will impact our business.
  In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 and a 1% reduction from April 1, 2022 through June 30, 2022, unless additional Congressional action is taken. In addition, on January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. More recently, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, beginning January 1, 2024.
 The cost of prescription pharmaceuticals in the United States has also been the subject of considerable discussion. There have been several Congressional inquiries, as well as legislative and regulatory initiatives and executive orders designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. Members of Congress and the Biden Administration have indicated they will continue to pursue legislative or administrative measures to control prescription drug costs, although the likelihood of such measures being adopted remains uncertain. For example, the Build Back Better Act, if enacted, would introduce substantial drug pricing reforms, including the establishment of a drug price negotiation program within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that would require manufacturers to charge a negotiated “maximum fair price” for certain selected drugs or pay an excise tax for noncompliance, and the establishment of rebate payment requirements on manufacturers of certain drugs payable under Medicare Parts B and D. If the Build Back Better Act is not enacted, similar or other drug pricing proposals could appear in future legislation.

 Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
  We anticipate that these new laws will result in additional downward pressure on coverage and the price that we receive for any approved product, and could seriously harm our business. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products. In addition, it is possible that there will be further legislation or regulation that could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Data Privacy and Security Laws
 Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, regulations and standards govern the collection, use, access to, confidentiality and security of health-related and other personal information, and could apply now or in the future to our operations or the operations of our partners. In the U.S., numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws and consumer protection laws and regulations govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. In addition, certain foreign laws govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health-related data. In particular, the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”) and implementing legislation in individual European countries impose specific compliance obligations relating to the processing and transfer of personal data of natural persons, including certain kinds of clinical trial data. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
Competition
 Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. New therapies and treatments based on innovative discoveries emerge frequently.
Our potential competitors are public and private companies, pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies who may be engaged in targeting the same biological processes that our compounds are designed to impact and who may be developing products for the same indications as our investigational drug candidates. Potential competitors could also include academic institutions, government agencies, other public and private research organizations and charitable venture philanthropic organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and/or establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization.
Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources, technical resources, expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials. As a result, our competitors may commercialize products more rapidly or effectively than we do, which would affect our competitive position, the likelihood that our drug candidates, if approved, would achieve and maintain market acceptance and our ability to generate meaningful revenues from our products.
Our commercial opportunities could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer side effects, are more convenient or are more affordable than any products that we develop. The key competitive factors affecting the success of ELX-02 and our other product candidates are their impact on the targeted diseases, superiority over competing products, long-term safety, convenience, price and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
Several companies are involved in researching and developing molecules targeting suppression of nonsense mutations and enhancement of translational read-through. However, we believe that ELX-02 is the only drug candidate in clinical development designed to treat nonsense mutations in CFTR, the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis. Additional competition to ELX-02 may arise from other programs that do not target a specific CFTR mutation class but work via other mechanisms.
Employees and Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2022, we had 15 employees in the United States and three employees in Israel. We believe that we have a good relationship with our employees. In order to achieve our goals, it is crucial that we continue to attract and retain top talent. To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to make our Company a safe and rewarding workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by strong compensation, benefits, health and wellness programs.
 We strive to maintain an inclusive environment free from discrimination of any kind, including sexual or other discriminatory harassment. Our employees have multiple avenues available through which inappropriate behavior can be reported, including a confidential hotline.
 As of December 31, 2022, 44% of our employees were female and 56% were male. We are committed to creating and maintaining a diverse and inclusive workplace in which all employees have an opportunity to participate and contribute to the success of the business and are valued for their skills, experience, and unique perspectives. We seek and respect different perspectives, points of view, backgrounds, and communication styles.
 We frequently benchmark our compensation practices and benefits programs against those of comparable industries and peer companies, and in the geographic areas where our facilities are located. We believe that our compensation and employee benefits are competitive and allow us to attract and retain qualified employees throughout our organization. In addition to salaries, employee benefits include annual discretionary bonuses, equity awards, a 401(k) plan for U.S. employees, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, and flexible work schedules, among others.
