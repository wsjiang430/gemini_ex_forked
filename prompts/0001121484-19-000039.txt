Our Business Strategy
We have historically grown our product and service offerings organically, through capital spending, and also through strategic acquisitions. Our investments are focused in growth areas and on areas where we expect to be able to expand market share through technology and where we believe we can achieve an attractive return on our investment. As part of our long-term strategy, we continue to review complementary acquisitions, invest in research and development and make organic capital expenditures to enhance our cash flows, leverage our cost structure and increase our stockholders’ returns. For additional discussion of our business strategy, please read "Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."
Recent Developments
In addition to capital spending, we have invested in acquisitions of businesses complementary to our growth strategy. Our acquisition strategy has allowed us to leverage our existing and acquired products and services into new geographic locations and has expanded the breadth of our technology and product offerings while allowing us to leverage our cost structure. We have made strategic and complementary acquisitions in each of our business segments in recent years.
On December 12, 2017 we entered into an agreement to acquire GEODynamics, which provides oil and gas perforation systems and downhole tools in support of completion, intervention, wireline and well abandonment operations. On January 12, 2018, we closed the acquisition of GEODynamics for total consideration of approximately $615 million (the "GEODynamics Acquisition"), consisting of (i) $295 million in cash (net of cash acquired), (ii) approximately 8.66 million shares of our common stock and (iii) an unsecured $25 million promissory note.
In connection with the GEODynamics Acquisition, we completed several financing transactions to extend the maturity of our debt, while also providing us with the flexibility to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility with anticipated future cash flows from operations.

On January 30, 2018, we sold $200 million aggregate principal amount of our 1.50% convertible senior notes due 2023 (the "Notes") through a private placement to qualified institutional buyers. We received net proceeds from the offering of the Notes of approximately $194 million, after deducting issuance costs. We used the net proceeds to repay a portion of the borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility"), substantially all of which were drawn to fund the cash portion of the purchase price paid for GEODynamics.
Concurrently with the Notes offering, we amended our Revolving Credit Facility (the "Amended Revolving Credit Facility") to extend the maturity date to January 2022, permit the issuance of the Notes and provide for up to $350 million in borrowing capacity.
On February 28, 2018, we acquired Falcon Flowback Services, LLC ("Falcon"), a full service provider of flowback and well testing services for the separation and recovery of fluids, solid debris and proppant used during hydraulic fracturing operations. Falcon provides additional scale and diversity to our Completion Services operations in key shale plays in the United States. The acquisition price was $84.2 million in cash. The Falcon acquisition was funded with borrowings under our Amended Revolving Credit Facility.
See Note 5, "Business Acquisitions" and Note 7, "Long-term Debt" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K for further discussion of these acquisitions and financing transactions.
Our Industry
We principally operate in the oilfield services industry and provide a broad range of products and services to our customers through each of our business segments. See Note 14, "Segments and Related Information," to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for financial information by segment along with a geographical breakout of revenues and long-lived assets for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018. Demand for our products and services is cyclical and substantially dependent upon activity levels in the oil and natural gas industry, particularly our customers' willingness to invest capital on the exploration for and development of crude oil and natural gas reserves. Our customers’ capital spending programs are generally based on their outlook for near-term and long-term commodity prices, economic growth, commodity demand and estimates of resource production. As a result, demand for our products and services is largely sensitive to expectations with respect to future crude oil and natural gas prices.
Our consolidated results of operations in 2018 include contributions from the GEODynamics and Falcon acquisitions completed in the first quarter of 2018 and reflect the impact of industry trends and customer spending activities, which were directed toward growth in the U.S. shale play regions with a general slowing of investments in deepwater markets globally since the start of a prolonged industry downturn in 2014.
Our historical financial results reflect the cyclical nature of the oilfield services industry – witnessed by periods of increasing and decreasing activity in each of our operating segments. The severe industry downturn that started in the second half of 2014 continued into 2017. This prolonged industry downturn has been characterized by materially reduced capital investments made by our customers, lower rig counts, lower completion activity, lower crude oil prices and other negative industry events. The industry decline was very rapid in the U.S. shale plays given the general lack of long-term contracts or backlog in these regions of operations. The U.S. rig count declined 79% from the peak in 2014 before bottoming in May of 2016. While the average U.S. rig count increased by 18% in 2018 from the 2017 average, activity levels in 2017 and 2018 were still well below 2014 levels. This significant activity decline had a material negative effect on the results of our Well Site Services segment before activities began to recover in the second half of 2017 and 2018. Our Offshore/Manufactured Products segment was also negatively impacted by the industry downturn but our results of operations declined at a slower pace given higher levels of backlog that existed at the beginning of 2014. Despite an initially slower decline in revenues and operating income when compared to our Well Site Services segment, our Offshore/Manufactured Products backlog declined materially from 2014 to 2018. This negatively impacted our results, particularly those tied to major deepwater projects. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the price of crude oil fell approximately 40% – with West Texas Intermediate crude oil closing at $45 per barrel on December 28, 2018. This precipitous decline in crude oil prices had a moderately negative impact on our fourth quarter 2018 consolidated results of operations, particularly those tied to activity in the U.S. shale play regions. We expect further customer-driven activity declines in early 2019 as customers reassess their budgets and plans in light of lower commodity prices. If the current pricing environment for crude oil does not improve or declines further, our customers may be required to further reduce their capital expenditures. This may cause additional declines in the demand for, and prices of, our products and services, which would adversely affect our future results of operations, cash flows and financial position. For additional information about activities in each of our segments, see "Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

Our Well Site Services segment is primarily affected by drilling and completion activity in the United States, including the Gulf of Mexico, and, to a lesser extent, Canada and the rest of the world. U.S. drilling and completion activity and, in turn, our Well Site Services results, are particularly sensitive to near-term fluctuations in commodity prices given the call-out nature of our operations in the segment. While there have been notable improvements in recent quarters, our Well Site Services segment continues to be negatively affected by the material decline in crude oil prices from the levels seen in 2014.
Similar to our Well Site Services segment, demand for our Downhole Technologies segment products is predominantly tied to the level of oil and natural gas exploration and production activity on land in the United States. The primary driver for this activity is the price of crude oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas. Activity levels have been, and we expect will continue to be, highly correlated with hydrocarbon commodity prices. Over recent years, our industry experienced increased customer spending in crude oil and liquids-rich exploration and development in the North American shale plays utilizing horizontal drilling and completion techniques. According to rig count data published by Baker Hughes, a GE company ("Baker Hughes"), the U.S. oil rig count peaked in October 2014 at 1,609 rigs but has declined materially since late 2014 due to much lower crude oil prices, totaling 885 rigs as of December 31, 2018 (with the U.S. oil rig count having troughed at 316 rigs in May 2016, which was the lowest oil rig count during this current cyclical downturn). As of December 31, 2018, oil-directed drilling accounted for 82% of the total U.S. rig count – with the balance being natural gas related. The total U.S. rig count has increased 679 rigs, or 168%, since troughing in May of 2016, largely due to improved crude oil prices, decreased service costs and enhanced technologies applied in the shale play regions of the United States.
Demand for the products and services supplied by our Offshore/Manufactured Products segment is generally driven by both the longer-term outlook for commodity prices and changes in land-based drilling and completion activity. During 2013 and 2014, we benefited from high crude oil prices resulting in very active bidding and quoting activity for our Offshore/Manufactured Products segment. However, the decline in crude oil prices that began in 2014 and continued into 2017, coupled with the relatively uncertain outlook around shorter-term and possibly longer-term commodity price improvements, have caused exploration and production companies to reevaluate their future capital expenditures in regards to deepwater projects since they are expensive to drill and complete, have long lead times to first production and may be considered uneconomical relative to the risk involved. Bidding and quoting activity for our Offshore/Manufactured Products segment continued after 2014, albeit at a substantially slower pace in the years following 2014. However, deepwater project award potential appears to be improving despite the current commodity price environment.
See "Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Macroeconomic Environment" for further discussion on our industry.
Well Site Services
Overview
For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our Well Site Services segment generated approximately 44%, 43% and 27%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue. Our Well Site Services segment includes a broad range of equipment and services that are used to drill for, establish and maintain the flow of oil and natural gas from a well throughout its life cycle. In this segment, our operations primarily include completion-focused equipment and services as well as land drilling services. We use our fleet of completion tools and drilling rigs to serve our customers at well sites and project development locations. Our equipment and services are used in both onshore and offshore applications throughout the drilling, completion and production phases of a well's life cycle.
Well Site Services Market
Demand for our completion and drilling services is predominantly tied to the level of oil and natural gas exploration and production activity on land in the United States. The primary driver for this activity is the price of crude oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas. Activity levels have been, and we expect will continue to be, highly correlated with hydrocarbon commodity prices.
Completion Services
Our Completion Services operations includes the complementary Falcon business we acquired on February 28, 2018. The combined business, which is primarily marketed through the brand names Oil States Energy Services, Falcon and Tempress, provides a wide range of services used in the onshore and offshore oil and gas industry, including:

• | wellhead isolation services;


• | flowback and frac valve services;


• | wireline and coiled tubing support services;

-6-


• | well testing, including separators and line heaters;


• | downhole extended-reach technology;


• | pipe recovery systems;


• | thru-tubing milling and fishing services;


• | hydraulic chokes and manifolds;


• | blowout preventers;


• | gravel pack and sand control operations on well bores; and


• | ball launching services.

Employees in our Completion Services business typically rig up and operate our equipment on the well site for our customers. Our Completion Services equipment is primarily used during the completion and production stages of a well. As of December 31, 2018, we provided completion services through approximately 45 distribution locations serving our customers in the United States, including the Gulf of Mexico, Canada and other international markets. We typically provide our services and equipment based on daily rates which vary depending on the type of equipment and the length of the job. Billings to our customers typically separate charges for our equipment from charges for our field technicians. We own patents or have patents pending covering some of our technology, particularly in our wellhead isolation equipment and downhole extended-reach technology product lines. Our customers in the Completion Services business include major, independent and private oil and gas companies and other large oilfield service companies. No customer in this segment represented more than 10% of our total consolidated revenue in any period presented. Competition in the Completion Services business is widespread and includes many smaller companies, although we also compete with the larger oilfield service companies for certain equipment and services.
Drilling Services
Our Drilling Services business, which is marketed under the brand name Capstar Drilling, provides land drilling services in the United States for shallow to medium depth wells generally of less than 15,000 feet. We serve two primary markets with our Drilling Services business: the Permian Basin in West Texas and the Rocky Mountain region. Drilling services are typically used during the exploration and development stages of a field. As of December 31, 2018, we had thirty-four drilling rigs with hydraulic pipe handling booms and lift capacities ranging from 150,000 to 500,000 pounds. Twenty-four are based in the Permian Basin and ten are based in the Rocky Mountain region, although a majority of these rigs are currently stacked. Utilization of our drilling rigs averaged 30%, 29% and 12% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Utilization improvement over this period was largely due to higher crude oil prices but has been tempered due to a shift by our customers towards newer, larger and higher horsepower rigs needed to drill extended depths and horizontal wells. We believe commodity prices should improve over the longer-term but there will be fewer wells in our depth range which could influence overall utilization of our drilling rigs.
We market our Drilling Services directly to a diverse customer base, consisting primarily of independent and private oil and gas companies. We contract on both a footage and a dayrate basis. Under a footage drilling contract, we assume responsibility for certain costs (such as bits and fuel) and assume more risk (such as the time necessary to drill) than we would on a daywork contract. Depending on market conditions and availability of drilling rigs, we see changes in pricing, utilization and contract terms. The land drilling service business is highly fragmented, and our competition consists of a small number of larger companies and many smaller companies. Our Permian Basin drilling activities primarily target oil reservoirs while our Rocky Mountain drilling activities target oil, liquids-rich and natural gas reservoirs.
Downhole Technologies
Overview
Our Downhole Technologies segment is comprised of the GEODynamics business we acquired in January 2018. GEODynamics was founded in 2004 as a researcher, developer and manufacturer of consumable engineered products used in completion applications. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our Downhole Technologies segment contributed approximately 20% of our consolidated revenue. This segment provides oil and gas perforation systems, downhole tools and services in support of completion, intervention, wireline and well abandonment operations. This segment designs, manufactures and markets its consumable engineered products to oilfield service as well as exploration and production companies.

Downhole Technologies Market
Similar to our Well Site Services segment, demand for our Downhole Technologies segment products is predominantly tied to the level of oil and natural gas exploration and production activity on land in the United States. The primary driver for this activity is the price of crude oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas. Activity levels have been, and we expect will continue to be, highly correlated with hydrocarbon commodity prices. Demand for this segment's products is also influenced by continued trends toward longer lateral lengths, increased frac stages and more perforation clusters to target increased unconventional well productivity.
Products
Product and service offerings for this segment include advanced perforation technology achieved through patented and proprietary systems combined with advanced modeling and analysis tools. This expertise has led to the optimization of perforation hole size, depth, and quality of tunnels, which are key factors for maximizing the effectiveness of hydraulic fracturing. Additional offerings include proprietary toe valve and frac plug products, which are focused on zonal isolation for hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells, and a broad range of consumable products, such as setting tools and bridge plugs, that are used in completion, intervention and decommissioning applications.
Customers and Competitors
Our customers in the Downhole Technologies segment include other oilfield services companies as well as major, independent and private oil and gas companies. No customer in this segment represented more than 10% of our total consolidated revenue in any period presented. Competition in the Downhole Technologies business is widespread and includes many smaller companies, although we also compete with the larger oilfield service companies for certain products and services.
Offshore/Manufactured Products
Overview
For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our Offshore/Manufactured Products segment generated approximately 36%, 57% and 73%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue. Through this segment, we provide technology driven highly-engineered products and services for offshore oil and natural gas production systems and facilities, as well as certain products and services to the offshore and land-based drilling and completion markets. Our products and services used primarily in deepwater producing regions include our FlexJoint® technology, advanced connector systems, high-pressure riser systems, compact valves, deepwater mooring systems, cranes, subsea pipeline products, specialty welding, fabrication, cladding and machining services, offshore installation services and inspection and repair services. In addition, we design, manufacture and market numerous other products and services used in both land and offshore drilling and completion activities and by non-oil and gas customers, including consumable downhole elastomer products that are utilized in onshore completion activities, valves and sound and vibration dampening products. We have facilities that support our Offshore/Manufactured Products segment in Arlington, Houston and Lampasas, Texas; Houma, Louisiana; Oklahoma City and Tulsa, Oklahoma; the United Kingdom; Brazil; Singapore; Thailand; Vietnam; China; the United Arab Emirates; and India.
Offshore/Manufactured Products Market
The market for products and services offered by our Offshore/Manufactured Products segment centers primarily on the development of infrastructure for offshore production facilities and their subsequent operations, exploration and drilling activities, and to a lesser extent, new rig and vessel construction, refurbishments or upgrades. Demand for oil and natural gas, and the related drilling and production in offshore areas throughout the world, particularly in deeper water, drive spending for these activities. Sales of our shorter-cycle products to land-based drilling and completion markets is driven by the level and complexity of drilling, completion and workover activity, particularly in North America.
Products and Services
In operation for more than 75 years, our Offshore/Manufactured Products segment provides a broad range of products and services for use in offshore development and drilling activities. This segment also provides products for onshore oil and natural gas, defense and general industries. Our Offshore/Manufactured Products segment is dependent in part on the industry's continuing innovation and creative applications of existing technologies. We own various patents covering some of our technology, particularly in our connector and valve product lines.

Offshore Development and Drilling Activities. We design, manufacture, inspect, assemble, repair, test and market OEM equipment for mooring, pipeline, production and drilling risers, and subsea applications along with equipment for offshore vessel and rig construction. Our products are components of equipment used for the drilling and production of oil and natural gas wells on offshore fixed platforms and mobile production units, including floating platforms, such as tension leg platforms, floating production, storage and offloading ("FPSO") vessels, Spars, and other marine vessels, floating rigs and jack-up rigs. Our products and services include:

• | flexible bearings and advanced connection systems;


• | casing and conductor connections and joints;


• | subsea pipeline products;


• | compact ball valves, manifold system components and diverter valves;


• | marine winches, mooring systems, cranes and other heavy-lift rig equipment;


• | production, workover, completion and drilling riser systems and their related repair services;


• | blowout preventer ("BOP") stack assembly, integration, testing and repair services;


• | consumable downhole products; and


• | other products and services, including welding, cladding and other metallurgical technologies.

Flexible Bearings and Advanced Connection Systems. We are the key supplier of flexible bearings, or FlexJoint® connectors, to the offshore oil and natural gas industry as well as weld-on connectors and fittings that join lengths of large diameter conductors or casing used in offshore drilling and production operations. A FlexJoint® is a flexible bearing that allows for rotational movement of a riser or tension leg platform tether while under high tension and/or pressure. When positioned at the top, bottom, or, in some cases, middle of a deepwater riser, it reduces the stress and loads on the riser while compensating for the pitch and rotational forces on the riser as the production facility or drilling rig moves with ocean forces. FlexJoint® connectors are used on drilling, production and export risers and are used increasingly as offshore production moves to deeper water. Drilling riser systems provide the vertical conduit between the floating drilling vessel and the subsea wellhead. Through the drilling riser, the drill string is guided into the well and drilling fluids are returned to the surface. Production riser systems provide the vertical conduit for the hydrocarbons from the subsea wellhead to the floating production facility. Oil and natural gas flows to the surface for processing through the production riser. Export risers provide the vertical conduit from the floating production facility to the subsea export pipelines. Our FlexJoint® connectors are a critical element in the construction and operation of production and export risers on floating production systems in deepwater.
Floating production systems, including tension leg platforms, FPSO facilities and Spars (defined below), are a significant means of producing oil and natural gas, particularly in deepwater environments. We provide many important products for the construction of these facilities. A tension leg platform ("TLP") is a floating platform that is moored by vertical pipes, or tethers, attached to both the platform and the sea floor. Our FlexJoint® tether bearings are used at the top and bottom connections of each of the tethers, and our Merlin™ connectors are used to efficiently assemble the tether joints during offshore installation. An FPSO is a floating vessel, typically ship shaped, used to produce and process oil and natural gas from subsea wells. A Spar is a floating vertical cylindrical structure which is approximately six to seven times longer than its diameter and is anchored in place. Our FlexJoint® connectors are used to attach the various production, injection, import or export risers to all of these floating production systems.
Casing and Conductor Connections and Joints. Our advanced connection systems provide connectors used in various drilling and production applications offshore. These connectors are welded onto pipe to provide more efficient joint to joint connections with enhanced tensile and burst capabilities that exceed those of connections machined onto plain-end-pipe. Our connectors are reusable and pliable and, depending on the application, are equipped with metal-to-metal seals. We offer a suite of connectors offering differing specifications depending on the application. Our Merlin™ connectors are our premier connectors combining superior static strength and fatigue life with fast, non-rotational make-up and a slim profile. Merlin™ connectors have been used in sizes up to 60 inches (outside diameter) for applications including open-hole and tie-back casing, offshore conductor casing, pipeline risers and TLP tendons which moor the TLP to the sea floor.
These flexible bearings and advanced connector systems are primarily manufactured through our Arlington, Texas, United Kingdom and Singapore locations.
Subsea Pipeline Products. We design and manufacture a variety of equipment used in the construction, maintenance, expansion and repair of offshore oil and natural gas pipelines. New construction equipment includes:

• | pipeline end manifolds and pipeline end terminals;


• | deep and shallow water pipeline connectors;


• | midline tie-in sleds;

-9-


• | forged steel Y-shaped connectors for joining two pipelines into one;


• | pressure-balanced safety joints for protecting pipelines and related equipment from anchor snags or a shifting sea-bottom;


• | electrical isolation joints; and


• | hot-tap clamps that allow new pipelines to be joined into existing lines without interrupting the flow of petroleum product.

We provide diverless connection systems for subsea flowlines and pipelines. Our HydroTech® collet connectors provide a high-integrity, proprietary metal-to-metal sealing system for the final hook-up of deep offshore pipelines and production systems. They also are used in diverless pipeline repair systems and in future pipeline tie-in systems. Our lateral tie-in sled, which is installed with the original pipeline, allows a subsea tie-in to be made quickly and efficiently using proven HydroTech® connectors without costly offshore equipment mobilization and without shutting off product flow.
We provide pipeline repair hardware, including deepwater applications beyond the depth of diver intervention. Our products include:

• | repair clamps used to seal leaks and restore the structural integrity of a pipeline;


• | mechanical connectors used in repairing subsea pipelines without having to weld;


• | misalignment and swivel ring flanges; and


• | pipe recovery tools for recovering dropped or damaged pipelines.

Our subsea pipeline products are primarily designed and manufactured at three of our Houston, Texas manufacturing locations.
Compact Ball Valves, Manifold System Components and Diverter Valves. Our Piper Valve division designs and manufactures compact high pressure valves and manifold system components for all environments of the oil and gas industry including onshore, offshore, drilling and subsea applications. Our valve and manifold bores are designed to closely match the inside diameter of the required pipe schedule for the system working pressure. The result is elimination of piping transition areas that minimize erosion and system friction pressure loss, resulting in a more efficient flow path. Our floating ball valve design with its large ball/seat interface has over 30 years of field service experience in upstream unprocessed produced liquids and gasses, assuring reliable service. Oil States Piper Valve Optimum Flow Technology is our way of helping end users maximize space, minimize weight and increase production. These products are designed and manufactured at our Oklahoma City, Oklahoma location.
Marine Winches, Mooring Systems, Cranes and other Heavy-Lift Rig Equipment. We design, engineer and manufacture marine winches, mooring systems, cranes and certain rig equipment. Our Skagit® winches are specifically designed for mooring floating and semi-submersible drilling rigs as well as positioning pipelay and derrick barges, anchor handling boats and jack-ups. Our Nautilus® marine cranes are used on production platforms throughout the world. We also design and fabricate rig equipment such as automatic pipe racking, blowout preventer handling equipment, as well as handling equipment used in the installation of offshore wind turbine platforms. Our engineering teams, manufacturing capability and service technicians, who install and service our products, provide our customers with a broad range of equipment and services to support their operations. Aftermarket service and support of our installed base of equipment to our customers is also an important source of revenue to us. These products are provided through our Houma, Louisiana; Navi Mumbai, India; and Rayong, Thailand locations.
Production, Workover, Completion and Drilling Riser Systems and their related repair services. Utilizing the expertise of our welding technology group, we have extended the boundaries of our Merlin™ connector technology with the design and manufacture of multiple riser systems. The unique Merlin™ connection has proven to be a robust solution for even the most demanding high-pressure (up to 20,000 psi) riser systems used in high-fatigue, deepwater applications. Our riser systems are designed to meet a range of static and fatigue stresses on par with those of our Tension Leg Element connectors. The connector can be welded or machined directly onto upset riser pipe and provide sufficient material to perform "re-cuts" after extended service. We believe that our marine riser offers superior tension capabilities together with one of the fastest run times in the industry. Auxiliary riser system components and running tools can be provided along with full service inspection and repair of these riser systems by our facilities worldwide.
BOP Stack Assembly, Integration, Testing and Repair Services. While not typically a manufacturer of BOP components, we design and fabricate lifting and protection frames for BOP stacks and offer the complete system integration of BOP stacks and subsea production trees. We can provide complete turnkey and design fabrication services. We also design and manufacture a variety of custom subsea equipment, such as riser flotation tank systems, guide bases, running tools and manifolds. In addition, we also offer blowout preventer and drilling riser testing and repair services. These assembly and testing services are offered through our Houston, Texas, United Kingdom, Singapore and Brazil locations.

Consumable Downhole Products. North American shale play development has expanded the need for more advanced completion tools. In order to reduce well completion costs, minimizing the time to drill out tools is very important. Our Offshore/Manufactured Products segment has leveraged its knowledge of molded thermoset composites and elastomers to help meet this demand. For example, we have had success in developing and producing composite drillable zonal isolation tools (i.e., bridge/frac plugs) utilizing design and production techniques that reduce cost while still delivering high quality performance. Time to drill out has been reduced significantly in comparison to other filament wound products in the market. Our products also include:

• | Swab Cups - used primarily in well servicing work;


• | Rod Guides/Centralizers - used in both drilling and production for pipe protection;


• | Gate Valve and Butterfly Valve Seats – we service many markets in the valve industry including well completion, refining, and distribution;


• | Casing and Cementing Products – we are a custom manufacturer of cementing plugs, well bore wipers, valve assemblies, combination plugs, specialty seals and gaskets; and


• | Service Tools – our products include frac balls, packer elements, zonal isolation tools, as well as many custom molded products used in the well servicing industry.

Other Products & Services. Our Offshore/Manufactured Products segment also produces a variety of products for use in industrial, military and other applications outside the oil and gas industry. For example, we provide:

• | sound and vibration isolation equipment for marine vessels;


• | metal-elastomeric FlexJoint® bearings used in a variety of naval and marine applications; and


• | drum-clutches and brakes for heavy-duty power transmission in the mining, paper, logging and marine industries.

Backlog
Offshore/Manufactured Products’ backlog consists of firm customer purchase orders for which contractual commitments exist and delivery is scheduled. Backlog in our Offshore/Manufactured Products segment was $179 million at December 31, 2018, compared to $168 million at December 31, 2017 and $199 million at December 31, 2016. We expect approximately 78% of our backlog at December 31, 2018 to be recognized as revenue during 2019. In some instances, these purchase orders are cancelable by the customer, subject to the payment of termination fees and/or the reimbursement of our costs incurred. While backlog cancellations have historically been insignificant, we incurred cancellations totaling $6.5 million during 2018 and $3.5 million during 2017, which we believe is attributable to lower commodity prices, the resultant decrease in capital spending by our customers and, in some cases, the financial condition of our customers. Additional cancellations may occur in the future, further reducing our backlog. Our backlog is an important indicator of future Offshore/Manufactured Products’ shipments and major project revenues; however, backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of our actual operating results for any future period. We believe that the offshore construction and development business is characterized by lengthy projects and a long "lead-time" order cycle. The change in backlog levels from one period to the next does not necessarily evidence a long-term trend.
Regions of Operations
Our Offshore/Manufactured Products segment provides products and services to customers in the major offshore crude oil and natural gas producing regions of the world, including the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Brazil, West Africa, the North Sea, Azerbaijan, Russia, India, Southeast Asia, China, the United Arab Emirates and Australia. In addition, we provide shorter-cycle products to customers in the land-based drilling and completion markets in the United States and, to a lesser extent, outside the United States.
Customers and Competitors
We market our products and services to a broad customer base, including direct end-users, engineering and design companies, prime contractors, and at times, our competitors through outsourcing arrangements. While no customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues in 2016, Halliburton Company individually accounted for 10% and 16% of our total consolidated revenues in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our main competitors in this segment include Cameron (a division of Schlumberger Limited), Dril-Quip, Inc., National Oilwell Varco, Inc., Baker Hughes (a GE Company), Hutchinson Group (a subsidiary of Total S.A.), Sparrows Offshore Group LTD, Oceaneering International, Inc. and Raina Engineers.

Seasonality of Operations
Our operations are directly affected by seasonal differences in weather in the areas in which we operate, most notably in the Rocky Mountain region, and the Gulf of Mexico. Severe winter weather conditions in the Rocky Mountain region can restrict access to work areas for our Well Site Services and Downhole Technologies segment operations. Our operations in the Gulf of Mexico are also affected by weather patterns. Weather conditions in the Gulf Coast region generally result in higher drilling activity in the spring, summer and fall months with the lowest levels of activity in the winter months. In addition, summer and fall drilling activity can be interrupted by hurricanes and other storms prevalent in the Gulf of Mexico and along the Gulf Coast. As a result of these seasonal differences, full year results are not likely to be a direct multiple of any particular quarter or combination of quarters.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, the Company employed 3,926 full-time employees on a consolidated basis, 49% of whom are in our Well Site Services segment, 13% of whom are in our Downhole Technologies segment, 36% of whom are in our Offshore/Manufactured Products segment, and 2% of whom are in our corporate headquarters. This compares to a total of 3,077 full-time employees as of December 31, 2017. We were party to collective bargaining agreements covering a small number of employees located in Argentina and the United Kingdom as of December 31, 2018. We believe we have good labor relations with our employees.
Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Matters
Our business operations are subject to numerous environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations that may be imposed domestically at the federal, regional, state, tribal and local levels or by foreign governments. Numerous governmental entities, including domestically the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives ("ATF"), the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration and analogous state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, often requiring difficult and costly actions. These laws and regulations may, among other things, (i) require the acquisition of permits to conduct drilling and other regulated activities; (ii) restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment or injected into subsurface formations in connection with oil and natural gas drilling and production activities; (iii) limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; (iv) impose stringent regulations on the licensing or storage and use of explosives; (v) require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as requirements to close pits and plug abandoned wells; (vi) impose specific safety and health criteria addressing worker protection; and (vii) impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from drilling operations and well site support services.
The more significant of these existing environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations include the following U.S. legal standards, as amended from time to time:

• | the Clean Air Act ("CAA"), which restricts the emission of air pollutants from many sources and imposes various pre-construction, operational, monitoring and reporting requirements, and that the EPA has relied upon as authority for adopting climate change regulatory initiatives relating to greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions;


• | the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act, which regulates discharges of pollutants from facilities to state and federal waters and establishes the extent to which waterways are subject to federal jurisdiction and rulemaking as protected waters of the United States;


• | the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which subjects owners and operators of vessels, onshore facilities, and pipelines, as well as lessees or permittees of areas in which offshore facilities are located, to liability for removal costs and damages arising from an oil spill in waters of the United States;


• | U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which govern oil and natural gas operations on federal lands and waters and impose obligations for establishing financial assurances for decommissioning activities, liabilities for pollution cleanup costs resulting from operations, and potential liabilities for pollution damages;


• | the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, which imposes liability on generators, transporters, and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur;


• | the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA"), which governs the generation, treatment, storage, transport, and disposal of solid wastes, including hazardous wastes;


• | the Safe Drinking Water Act ("SDWA"), which ensures the quality of the nation’s public drinking water through adoption of drinking water standards and controlling the injection of waste fluids into below-ground formations that may adversely affect drinking water sources;

-12-


• | the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, which requires facilities to implement a safety hazard communication program and disseminate information to employees, local emergency planning committees, and response departments on toxic chemical uses and inventories;


• | the Occupational Safety and Health Act, which establishes workplace standards for the protection of the health and safety of employees, including the implementation of hazard communications programs designed to inform employees about hazardous substances in the workplace, potential harmful effects of these substances, and appropriate control measures;


• | the Endangered Species Act, which restricts activities that may affect federally identified endangered and threatened species or their habitats through the implementation of operating restrictions or a temporary, seasonal, or permanent ban in affected areas;


• | the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires federal agencies, including the Department of the Interior, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to impact the environment and that may require the preparation of environmental assessments and more detailed environmental impact statements that may be made available for public review and comment;


• | the Department of Transportation regulations, which relate to advancing the safe transportation of energy and hazardous materials, including explosives, and emergency response preparedness; and


• | regulations adopted by the ATF, a law enforcement agency under the U.S. Department of Justice, that impose stringent licensing conditions with respect to the acquisition, storage and use of explosives for well site support services in the oil and natural gas sector.

These environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations generally restrict the level of pollutants emitted to ambient air, discharges to surface water, and disposals or other releases to surface and below-ground soils and ground water. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil, and criminal penalties; the imposition of investigatory, remedial, and corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures; the occurrence of restrictions, delays or cancellations in the permitting, development or expansion of projects; and the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting some or all of our activities in a particular area. Additionally, multiple environmental laws provide for citizen suits, which allow environmental organizations to act in place of the government and sue operators for alleged violations of environmental laws. See Risk Factors under Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10‑K for further discussion on environmental laws and regulations, including with respect to hydraulic fracturing; ozone standards, induced seismicity regulatory developments; climate change, including methane or other GHG emissions; storage and use of explosives; offshore drilling and related regulatory developments, including with respect to decommissioning obligations; and other regulations relating to environmental protection. The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor determinable as existing standards are subject to change and new standards continue to evolve.
Additionally, there exist regional, state, tribal and local jurisdictions in the United States where we operate that also have, or are developing or considering developing, similar environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations governing many of these same types of activities. Outside of the United States, there are foreign countries and provincial, regional, tribal or local jurisdictions therein where we are conducting business that also have, or may be developing, regulatory initiatives or analogous controls that regulate our environmental-related activities. While the legal requirements imposed in foreign countries or jurisdictions therein may be similar in form to U.S. laws and regulations, in some cases the actual implementation of these requirements may impose additional, or more stringent, conditions or controls that can significantly restrict, delay or cancel the permitting, development or expansion of a project or substantially increase the cost of doing business. Moreover, both in the United States and in foreign countries, environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations, including new or amended legal requirements that may arise in the future to address potential environmental concerns such as air and water impacts or to address perceived health or safety-related concerns such as oil and natural gas development in close proximity to specific occupied structures and/or certain environmentally-sensitive or recreational areas, are expected to continue to have a considerable impact on our operations.
We have acquired certain properties supportive of oil and natural gas activities from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons, hazardous substances or wastes at or from such properties were not under our control prior to acquiring them. Under environmental laws and regulations, we could incur strict joint and several liability for remediating hydrocarbons, hazardous substances or wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators. We also could incur costs related to the clean-up of third-party sites to which we sent regulated substances for disposal or to which we sent equipment for cleaning, and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at or from such third-party sites.
We have incurred and will continue to incur operating and capital expenditures, some of which may be material, to comply with environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. Historically, our environmental compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operational results. The ultimate

financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor determinable as existing standards are subject to change and new standards continue to evolve. Although we are not fully insured against all environmental and occupational health and safety risks, and our insurance does not cover any penalties or fines that may be issued by a governmental authority, we maintain insurance coverage that we believe is sufficient based on our assessment of insurable risks and consistent with insurance coverage held by other similarly situated industry participants. Nevertheless, it is possible that other developments, such as stricter and more comprehensive environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations, claims for damages to property or persons or disruption of our customers' operations resulting from our actions or omissions, and imposition of penalties due to our operations could have a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations.
