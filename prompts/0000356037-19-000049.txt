Item 1.     Business
 CSP Inc. ("CSPi" or "CSPI" or "the Company" or "we" or "our") was incorporated in 1968 and is based in Lowell, Massachusetts. To meet the diverse requirements of our commercial and defense customers worldwide, CSPi and its subsidiaries develop and market IT integration solutions, advanced security products, managed IT services, cloud services, purpose built network adapters, and high-performance cluster computer systems.
 On July 31, 2018, CSPi LTD sold all of the outstanding stock of Modcomp GmbH for $14.4 million cash, and recognized a gain of $16.8 million. The divestiture of our German operations and our increased cash position enables us to focus time and resources on our higher-margin and greater-potential growth opportunities. We are encouraged by the traction of our managed services business in the U.S. and we intend to continue to invest and focus on our new ARIA SDS cyber security products and to capitalize on the proliferation of our wireless service business.
 Segments
 CSPI operates in two segments: Technology Solutions ("TS") and High Performance Products ("HPP").
 TS Segment
 The TS segment consists of our wholly-owned Modcomp subsidiary, which operates in the United States and the United Kingdom.
 The TS segment generates product revenues by reselling third-party computer hardware and software as a value added reseller ("VAR"). The TS segment generates service revenues by the delivery of integration services for complex IT environments, including advanced security; unified communications and collaboration; wireless and mobility; data center solutions; and network solutions as well as managed IT services ("MSP") that primarily serve the small and mid-sized business market ("SMB").
 Third party products and professional services are marketed and sold through the Company’s direct sales force into a variety of vertical markets, including; automotive; defense; health care; education; federal, state and local government; and maritime.
 CSPi sold all of the outstanding stock of Modcomp GmbH to Reply AG on July 31, 2018 for total cash consideration of $14.4 million. CSPi recognized a one-time gain of $16.8 million. The Company determined the German subsidiary met the criteria for discontinued operations under ASC 205. The Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Operations reflect the results of Modcomp GmbH classified as discontinued operations at and as of September 30, 2018. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
 HPP Segment

· | The HPP segment revenue comes from four distinct product lines: (i) a cybersecurity solution marketed as ARIA™ Software-Defined Security (“SDS”), which is offered to commercial, original equipment manufacturers ("OEM") and government customers; (ii) the Myricom® network adapters for commercial, government and OEM customers; (iii) the ARIA nVoy Series of appliances for Managed Security Service Providers (“MSSPs”) and end-user customers; and (iv) the legacy Multicomputer product portfolio for digital signal processing ("DSP") applications within the defense markets. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The ARIA SDS solution is a software portfolio starting with the underlying platform (orchestrator, light-weight instances), and hosted applications, as well as supporting hardware (turn-key security appliances), all developed to secure an organization’s network, enterprise-wide, to better protect critical devices, applications and high-

value data, such as personally identifiable information ("PII"), from breaches. Revenue will come from the sale of licenses of our software platform components, hosted applications, turnkey appliances and the required support packages. The software licenses are renewable on an annual basis. The ARIA SDS platform and applications can be deployed on our separately sold Myricom adapters that can be deployed within our customers servers, or via our turn-key appliances that can be deployed in data centers or within the customers network to provide network security services. Alternatively, with future releases, organizations will be able deploy ARIA SDS on cloud infrastructure as a service to protect this portion of their IT environment. We had our first sale in the last half of fiscal year 2019 and the pipeline has started to build up for fiscal year 2020. We expect to have additional revenue starting in the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, which we expect will increase throughout the year. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We anticipate that the ARIA SDS portfolio will be of value to regulated industries, such as financial services or healthcare, due to the rise of data-privacy regulations enforced at the federal, U.S. state, and international level, as well as industry entities. We also believe the unique, patent-pending approach will be attractive to managed security services providers (MSSP) and OEMs that pursue differentiated security services for their customers. While our initial offerings of the ARIA SDS portfolio are available now, the number of offerings will continue to expand over time.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Myricom network adapters (ARC Series and SIA) are optimized for and sold into markets that require high bandwidth and low latency including (i) packet capture, (ii) financial transactions, and (iii) storage interconnect. And with our SIA organizations that require advanced security features added to their production server deployments. Our primary customers for packet capture include government agencies that need to capture, inject, and analyze network traffic at line rate, and OEMs selling into vendors of computer security appliances. Financial institutions, such as banks, and brokerage firms use Myricom adapters to decrease transaction times. Our storage interconnect customers, primarily in the film industry, use our adapters for video capture and film editing. Organizations that run advanced network security features benefit from the ability to run such applications safely on our adapter preserving server performance for production applications. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The nVoy Series of appliances (Packet Recorder and Packet Broker) can be deployed as part of an organization’s data security structure as a new component to complement existing systems and provides data breach verification and notification as well as compliance reporting. The primary customers will be OEMs or MSSPs that are looking to expand their product and services offerings of industry regulation compliance and breach response solutions.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Multicomputer products for DSP applications are no longer being actively developed but will continue to be sold for deployment and supported for several years. Revenue flows come from servicing previously deployed products for a modest number of existing high-value defense customers. Therefore, the revenue from these products, as a percentage of overall Company revenue, is expected to decline over time.

management, security and storage systems integration services business, our competitors are extensive and vary to a certain degree in each of the geographical markets, but they also include such national competitors as HP/EDS, IBM and Cap Gemini.
 Nearly all of our product offerings are available through other channels. Favorable competitive factors for the TS segment include procurement capability, product diversity which enables the delivery of complete and custom solutions to our customers and the strength of our key business relationships with the major IT OEMs. We also consider our ability to meet the unique and/or specialized needs of the SMB and LEB markets and our strong knowledge of the IT products that we sell to be a key competitive advantage. Our ability to provide managed services through our network operations center and the professional IT services required to design and install custom IT solutions to address our customers' IT needs are distinct competitive advantages. Unfavorable competitive factors include low name recognition, limited geographic coverage and pricing.
 Backlog
 The backlog of customer orders and contracts for the TS segment was approximately $4.0 million at September 30, 2019, as compared to $7.2 million at September 30, 2018. Our backlog can fluctuate greatly. These fluctuations can be due to the timing of receiving large orders for third-party products and/or IT services. It is expected that all of the customer orders in backlog will ship and/or be provided during fiscal year 2020.
 HPP Segment
 Products and Services
 The mission of the HPP team is to deliver a differentiated, smarter approach to cybersecurity. Our software-defined platform makes it easier for organizations to achieve enterprise-wide network security and protection of critical assets, applications and devices by improving their network visibility capabilities and accelerating their incident response.     Products
 The ARIA SDS solution will give organizations an automated, central, and coordinated way to accelerate cyber threat detection and response, implement and enforce security polices, control which applications can access critical assets, and to protect applications and the associated data. The ARIA Orchestrator ("SDSo") and instances ("SDSi"), provide the foundation of the ARIA platform, so that a series of lightweight advanced security applications can be deployed, provisioned and managed uniformly across any sized organization.
     These instances can be deployed in a variety of scenarios including bare metal servers, virtual machines ("VMs"), and container-based compute environments. The ARIA SDSo will automatically detect any instances and will programmatically execute the specified applications security feature set strengthening an organization's security posture.
     For customers that desire a turnkey solution, a bundled offering can be created for deployment and opens the possibility for professional services and integration services offerings to our channel.
     ARIA SDS APPLICATIONS
 The deployment of hosted applications bring life to the ARIA SDS platform.  Application availability will expand over time as new products are released. However, the current offerings we believe have significant market potential.
    
1) ARIA SDS Packet Intelligence: The ARIA Packet Intelligence ("PI") application directs all of an organization’s network traffic to existing intrusion detection systems (“IDS”) security tools such as security information and event management solutions ("SIEMs"), user and entity behavior analytics ("UEBA"), or network intrusion protection systems ("NIPS” or “IPS"), and making these tools more effective at detecting network-born threats.
    
 
  6
 


The ARIA PI application will be available as licensed functionality within a low-cost high-availability ("HA") security appliance, or probe, that taps into an organization’s network infrastructure, as well as on the Myricom Secure Intelligent Adapter ("SIA"). The probe will be able to mine data at 10-25G line rates and perform remedial actions to stop threats on a per-traffic stream basis while minimizing impact on network traffic performance. Built-in APIs allow compatible 3rd party threat detection tools to take actions to stop detected threats. It is our belief that competing solutions currently do not provide this mix and level of capability. We will be able to provide a packaged solution by installing 3rd party IPS/IDS applications, onto ARIA hardware appliances that run alongside and are fed by ARIA SDS applications, such as Packet Intelligence. The ARIA PI application will be able to improve IPS or IDS performance by preprocessing the data feeds, allowing such solutions to run effectively at higher line rates.
    
2) ARIA SDS Packet Capture: Our Sniffer10G ("SNF") software is used by intelligence agencies for packet capture, network surveillance applications, and to perform detailed cyber-threat analysis. It’s a recommended solution to increase the Zeek IDS (formerly known as Bro) to support 10G line rates rather than the standard 1G. With the introduction of ARIA SDS and the Myricom SIA, SNF will be upgraded to support a 25G line-rate. When used in conjunction with the Packet Intelligence application, the SNF application can provide the details required to determine the exact type of threat and/or identify the compromised data records.
    
3) ARIA SDS KMS (Key Management Server): The ARIA KMS application will make it easier to add encryption and decryption capabilities to applications which leverage a standards-based key management interoperability protocol ("KMIP") client. For example, each of VMware’s vSphere and vSAN instances leverage a KMIP client to encrypt their application data output. As such, they need to be fed KMIP compatible keys to perform encryption. Depending upon the size of the environment, this could require hundreds of keys per minute. Our KMS key management server solution provides such KMIP keys securely and rapidly at scale while ensuring that the key servers are highly available at all times. Our application was designed to solve the deployment complexity challenges currently associated with key management.
    
4) ARIA AIR (Automated Investigative Response) The ARIA AIR and Packet Recorder applications will make it easier to detect data breaches and exfiltrated data from critical data applications. Used in conjunction with threat intelligence tools which will alert if an internal system is accessing a bad site, we ingest the alert use it to trigger a search our recordings of the traffic flowing from the critical applications to determine if there is a match. This indicates a breach and provides a record of all the records that have been exfiltrated.
     MYRICOM NETWORK ADAPTERS
    
Myricom ARC Series product line includes a portfolio of Ethernet adapters and specialized software, which is branded as DBL for financial institutions and Sniffer10G ("SNF") for network monitoring. Both are compatible with Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, and VMware ESX. Our adapters act as stand-alone Network Interface Cards ("NIC”) and support purpose-built for applications that provide high bandwidth, low latency and line-rate packet capture, and processing off load for high-frequency financial trading and network traffic analysis applications.


Myricom Secure Intelligent Adapter ("SIA") is our next-generation adapter and will provide additional compute capabilities and specialized hardware to run the ARIA SDS platform and applications. A 25G version of SNF is being developed to deliver higher line rates as required by enterprise and government customers. This will also let these organizations achieve lossless packet capture and packet inspection, which is required for network surveillance use cases and tools, such as lawful intercept, deep packet inspection, forensic tools, and threat detection applications. Other customers for the SIA include OEMs and MSSP partners to run their own applications upon.
     ARIA SECURITY APPLIANCES
     ARIA Security Appliances provides a standalone solution that can be either deployed in line to provide network security or within a data center to provide security services. These appliances are built with one or multiple built in SIA adapters. This allows for broader options to deploy our services in a turnkey fashion.

 nVoy Series is comprised of a 100G Packet Broker and a 10G Packet Recorder appliance optimized to run our ARIA software. These tools assist customers in the deployment of our ARIA solution into higher speed networks, as well as provide the compute and storage intensive functions needs to provide some of our services such as Packet recording.
     MULTICOMPUTER PRODUCTS
    
Multicomputer products portfolio includes the 2000 SERIES VME and 3000 SERIES VXS systems. The 2000 SERIES products, based on PowerPC RISC processors with AltiVec™ technology, high-speed memory, and Myrinet-2000™ cluster interconnect, are currently is use by customers in the aerospace, commercial, and defense markets. The 3000 SERIES VXS product line, incorporating the Freescale QorIQ PowerPC processors with AltiVec technology, targets high-performance DSP, signal intelligence ("SIGINT"), and radar and sonar applications in airborne, shipboard, and unmanned aerial vehicle ("UAV") platforms where space, power, and cooling are at a premium. The HPP segment will continue to ship and repair existing Multicomputer products to its customer base and support an installed base of DSP systems.
     Royalties on Multicomputer products
      We license the design of certain 2000 SERIES computer processor boards and switch interconnect technology to third parties. In exchange for licensing this technology, we receive a royalty payment for each processor board that utilizes our design for these products.
     Markets, Marketing and Dependence on Certain Customers
     Aerospace & Defense Market
     Our focus for fiscal 2020 and beyond is to continue our support of established Multicomputer and Myricom products allowing system deployments to be made by government entities. These programs have support requirements that often extend beyond twenty years.     Financial Transactions Market
     Myricom network adapters with DBL application software address the need for the ultra-low latency required in the world of financial trading. Running DBL on the Myricom ARC Series provides acceleration for 10G Ethernet environments, with benchmarked application-to-application latency in the single digit microsecond range for Linux and Microsoft Windows operating systems.

 Cyber Security Products Market
     The ARIA SDS solution is targeted at organizations that need to get additional functionality out of their current cyber security solutions to find and stop intrusion threats, while also reducing their operating costs. While our ARIA SDS solutions will be offered through our direct sales channel, it is more likely that sales will come through via independent software vendor channels to the end customers. These value added resellers will find ARIA appealing to expand their portfolio of security products and services and replace less-effective tools and processes in their customer environments.
     OEMs in the cyber security segments will be candidates for ARIA SDS deployments. These vendors can benefit from integrating the ARIA applications as internal solution toolsets to allow their application to scale, add critical functionality, or solve particular problems, such as poor performance. OEMs are interested in the Myricom Adapters including our SIA running our ARIA SDS applications, for use as Smart NICs within their appliances. We believe this will be a large growing market we can participate in in the coming years.
     Another target for the ARIA solution will be the managed security services providers, as these providers’ desire simple, yet differentiated, solutions that can be deployed across their customer bases. The orchestration and automation capabilities found in ARIA SDS are valuable as they allow these security service providers to scale their offerings while increasing the productivity of their security operation center staff.
     Competition
     CSPi’s competition in the cybersecurity space comes primarily from the large, traditional security vendors like Dell, IBM, and Intel. Due to the ARIA’s approach to network and data security, we also face competition from traditional security tools and current approaches to finding network based attacks. The competition includes common firewall manufacturers with broad portfolios such as Palo Alto or Cisco, and in the case of data packet brokers, Gigamon and Ixia. Competitors for ARIA SDS encryption include applications and appliances provided by Thales, HPE’s Voltaic group, and other smaller market players.
     In the crowded security products market, our history of supporting defense and government military programs, strong security application expertise, and the ability to develop optimized products for OEMs will help set us apart. However, we must continually develop new features and solutions to stay abreast of evolving customer requirements and leverage advances in technology. One example is Intel’s chip-level roadmap that may provide additional functionality for our ARIA SDS solution but our competitors could also attempt to leverage this. Some of these competitors may also be potential go-to-market partners or OEM customers looking to integrate our capabilities within their products and solutions.
     Customers who need a combination of advanced data protection features and who require optimized application performance are best suited to the ARIA solution. Security adapter products will also leverage previous generation Myricom ARC Series network adapter capabilities that include advanced filtering, support for kernel bypass technologies, lossless packet capture, and precision time stamping. These new capabilities will offer a variety of security service combinations that our customers can put to use.
     Manufacturing, Assembly and Testing
     Currently, all Multicomputer products are shipped to our customers directly from our plant in Lowell, Massachusetts. Our manufacturing activities consist mainly of final assembly and testing of printed circuit boards and systems that are designed by us and fabricated by outside third-party vendors.
     Upon our receipt of material and components from outside suppliers, our quality assurance technicians inspect these products and components. During manufacture and assembly, both sub-assemblies and completed systems are subjected to extensive testing, including burn-in and environmental stress screening designed to minimize equipment failure at delivery and over the useful service life of the system. We also use diagnostic programs to detect and isolate

potential component failures. A comprehensive log is maintained of past failures to monitor the ongoing reliability of our products and improve design standards.
     Currently, Myricom products, including the nVoy appliances and Myricom network adapters, are shipped to our customers directly from our plant in Lowell, Massachusetts. The packet recorder and packet broker appliances are sourced from third-party partners, integrated with CSPi software and resold under the CSPi brand. Our network adapters are designed in-house and fabricated by outside third party vendors. Material and components received from outside suppliers are inspected by our quality assurance technicians.
     The ARIA SDS solution (platform and applications) will be downloaded and licensed from servers or content-delivery services directly controlled by CSPi. The ARIA software can be sold in conjunction with the Myricom SIA, or our appliances, which may be preloaded with the appropriate images. Licensing will be handled by the ARIA SDSo which will be accessible by CSPi’s licensing severs to allow proper flexible services feature set activation and payment.
     We provide a warranty covering defects arising from the sale of Multicomputer and Myricom products, which varies from 90 days to three years, depending upon the particular unit in question.
     Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
     Several components used in our HPP segment products are obtained from sole-source suppliers. We are dependent on key vendors such as Xilinx or NXP for a variety of processors for certain products and Wind River Systems, Inc. for VxWorks operating system software. Despite our dependence on these sole-source suppliers, based on our current forecast and our projected sales obligations, we believe we have adequate inventory on hand and our current near-term requirements can be met in the existing supply chain.     Research and Development
 For the year ended September 30, 2019, our expenses for R&D were approximately $2.8 million compared to approximately $3.3 million for fiscal year 2018. Expenditures for R&D are expensed as they are incurred. Product development efforts in fiscal year 2019 involved development of the ARIA SDS product set, and enhancements to our Myricom products, in which we expect to continue to make investments related to the development of new hardware adapter products and the ARIA SDS software that enables the hardware to meet the needs of specific applications. Our current R&D plan is intended to extend the usefulness and marketability of these products by adding features and capabilities to meet the needs of our markets. Intellectual Property
 We rely on a combination of trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights. We have two pending patents for the ARIA SDS software and will be pursuing additional patent rights over time.     Backlog
 The backlog of customer orders and contracts in the HPP segment was approximately $0.5 million at September 30, 2019 as compared to $1.0 million at September 30, 2018. Our backlog can fluctuate greatly. These possible large fluctuations can be due to the timing of receipt of large orders often for purchases from prime contractors for sales to the government. It is expected that all of the customer orders in backlog will ship within the next twelve months from September 30, 2019.
