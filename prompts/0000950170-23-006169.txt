Industry Overview
 We serve a growing multi-billion dollar global industrial market that is highly fragmented and comprised of many industrial sectors and niche applications. Our legacy sectors include industrial wastewater treatment, industrial ventilation systems and contamination controls and filtration, semiconductor fabrication, electronics manufacturing, baseload and backup power generation, hydrocarbon processing, chemical processing, natural gas processing and transport, automobile and aircraft production, polysilicon production, battery recycling, metals processing and production, and produced water treatment. Emerging sectors and applications include electric vehicle and battery production, desalination water transport, ultra-high purity water treatment for electrolysis and electronics production, naval/marine vessel oily water treatment, aluminum beverage can production, and lightweight, high-strength metals production.
We believe demand for our products and services will continue to be driven by the following factors:
 •Global Focus on the Environment. Increased demand for efficient solutions and reduced air and water emissions remains at the forefront of sustainable production. As our customers and end markets navigate this changing landscape, we are making production and power generation cleaner, more efficient and flexible, and workplaces safer. Increasingly society, along with government regulation, is calling for companies to commit to the preservation and protection of the environment. We believe that through our air and water quality and emissions control offerings, companies want to work with us to protect people and our planet from the harmful effects of industrial processes. 
 •Increasingly Stringent Regulatory Environment. The adoption of increasingly stringent environmental regulations globally requires businesses to pay strict attention to environmental protection and efficient production processes. The businesses and industries we serve must comply with these various international, federal, state and local government regulations or potentially face substantial fines or be forced to suspend production or alter their production processes. Providing assistance in meeting or exceeding stringent environmental regulations are a principal factor that drives our business. 
 •Favorable Investment Climate for Net-zero Technologies. Our businesses are positively impacted by capital expenditures on technologies to address climate change and improve environmental outcomes.
 •Emerging Market Industrialization. The rapid expansion of manufacturing in emerging economies increases the demand for our industrial air treatment and pollution controls for newly constructed and upgraded facilities. For investments in 


semiconductor and electronics production, sources of ultra-pure water are required as are emission controls and scrubbers. We expect that more rigorous regulations being introduced to protect the workforce, the environment, and the operating equipment will favorably impact demand for our products and solutions.
 •Developed Market Industrial Reshoring. The industries in which we operate have historically embraced a global supply chain which has provided certain advantages by offshoring select production and services. Today many companies are relocating their global supply chains to resume in-region. We believe the re-shoring of manufacturing operations is a driver of business growth.
 •Expansion and Renewal of Infrastructure. There is a growing trend to better manage and reduce air and water emissions which our products and solutions equipment will serve. In 2021, the US Congress passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act with $550 billion of new federal spending aimed at rebuilding roads and bridges, improving climate resilience, and improving environmental outcomes. As industrial capital expenditures grow, corporations are seeking to make these investments with a smaller environmental impact. This new spending serves as a driver of increased interest for our portfolio of products and solutions.
 •Water Scarcity. There are increasing risks associated with water quality and water access around the globe. Protecting water resources is crucial for the health and resiliency of our communities, ecosystems and our customers. We expect that more rigorous regulations are being, and will be introduced, to protect water as a natural resource. We are well-positioned to deliver solutions to our customers to meet this growing need.
 •Increased Demand for Electrical Power Generation. An accelerating shift away from traditional fossil fuel powered electricity generation and transportation towards cleaner and sustainable forms of power generation and mass “electrification” of transportation is underway. Demand for cleaner burning natural gas, renewable natural gas, hydrogen and its derivatives, renewables including solar and wind, and a resurgence in interest in nuclear is growing. In addition, the planned retirements of the coal- and oil-fired plants require greater investments in natural gas-fired and renewables generation. Natural gas-fired power plants have lower initial capital requirements and are more flexible in terms of operations. The transition to hydrogen and other “green” fuels (such as HVO’s, biogas, and green ammonia) are in their infancy but will be part of the energy transition over the next decade. Even though considered “green” fuels, power plants using these fuels will continue to require exhaust emissions control solutions which we provide, as will the production facilities and producers of the lightweight materials, batteries, and electronics required to build and operate the new vehicles being deployed.
 •Expanding Natural Gas Infrastructure. The International Energy Association projects a pronounced shift in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries for electricity generation away from oil and coal towards natural gas, including liquified natural gas (“LNG”), and renewables. Natural gas, including LNG, continues to be the growth fuel of choice for the electrical power and industrial sectors in many of the world’s regions in primary power generation, and as a complement to renewables as a source of backup and standby power. The pipeline and storage infrastructure required to supply these new users creates increased interest in our products and services.
 •Hydrocarbon Processing. Hydrocarbon processing involves the production, refining, and processing of hydrocarbons and organic chemicals (petrochemicals) for use in a variety of downstream applications, such as gasoline, aviation fuel, fertilizers, lubricants, polymers, plastics, paints and coatings, and additives that keep industry and our economies operating. In response to increasing global demand for petrochemicals and refined products, companies are producing a wider range of intermediate and final products from new sources, upgrading and expanding existing facilities and process lines, and constructing new production and processing. These new and expanded facilities must comply with stricter environmental regulations, wastewater discharge, and emission controls requirements, and the adaptation of production processes will require new or modified catalyst recovery and regeneration systems which we provide.
 These factors, individually or collectively, tend to drive increases in industrial capital spending that are not directly impacted by general economic conditions. In contrast, favorable conditions in the economy generally lead to plant expansions and the construction of new industrial sites. However, in a weak economy, customers tend to lengthen the time from initial inquiry to the purchase order or may elect to defer purchases.

We continually collaborate with our customers on projects to ensure the proper solution and customer satisfaction. The project development cycle may follow many different paths depending on the specifics of the job and end market. The cycle can take from one to more than twelve months from concept and design to production but may vary significantly depending on developments that occur during the process, including among others, the emergence of new environmental demands, changes in design specifications and ability to obtain necessary approvals.
Sales, Marketing and Support
 Our global commercial strategy is to provide a solutions-based approach for our customers, which may take on the role of single source provider of technology, products and equipment for a particular project. When called upon, this strategy involves expanding our scope of supply by utilizing our portfolio of in-house technologies and those of third-party equipment suppliers, many of which have been long-standing partners evolved from pure supplier roles to value-added business partners. Where we identify a technology that is a critical element or commonly required for a solution, we will consider acquiring such technology to ensure we have the appropriate degree of strategic control. This enables us to leverage existing business with selective alliances of suppliers and

application specific engineering expertise. Our value proposition to our customers is to provide competitively priced, customized solutions that leverage our vast project experience base and design library. Our industry-specific knowledge, accompanied by our product and service offerings, provides valuable benefits for our customers and synergies across our network of partners.
 We sell and market our products and services with our own direct sales force, in key regions including the United States, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Canada, United Arab Emirates, India, China, Korea, and Singapore. Our direct sales and business development teams when appropriate will work in conjunction with outside sales representatives in the North America, South America, Europe, Middle East, Southeast and East Asia, and India regions. We expect to continue expanding our sales and support capabilities and our network of outside sales representatives in key regions domestically and internationally.
 We market our offerings to our customers through a variety of channels including, but not limited to, digital, web, social media, email campaigns, individual customer visits, product announcements, brochures, magazine articles, advertisements and cover or article features in trade journals and other publications. We also participate in public relations and promotional events, including industry tradeshows and technical conferences.
Our customer service organization and sales force provides our customers with technical assistance, use and maintenance information as well as other key information regarding their purchase. We also actively provide our customers with access to key information regarding changes and pending changes in environmental regulations as well as new product or service developments. We believe that maintaining a close relationship with our customers and providing them with the support they request improves their level of satisfaction and enables us to foresee their potential future product needs or service demands. Moreover, this approach can lead to sales of annual service and support contracts as well as consumables. Our website also provides our customers with online tools and technical resources.
 Quality Assurance
 In engineered systems, quality is defined as system performance. We review with our customers, before the contract is signed, the technical specification and the efficiency of the equipment that will be customized to meet their specific needs. We then review these same parameters internally to assure that warranties will be met. Standard project management and production management tools are used to help ensure that all work is done to specification and that project schedules are met. Equipment is tested at the site to ensure it is functioning properly.
Customers
 We are not dependent upon any single customer, and no customer contributed 10% or more of our consolidated revenues for 2022.
 Suppliers and Subcontractors
 We purchase our raw materials and supplies from a variety of global sources. When possible, we directly secure iron and steel sheet and plate products from steel mills, whereas other materials are purchased from a variety of steel service centers. Steel prices have traditionally been volatile, but we typically mitigate the risk of higher prices by including a “surcharge” on our standard products. On contract work, we try to mitigate the risk of higher prices by including the current price in our estimate and generally include price inflation clauses for protection.
Typically, on turnkey projects, we subcontract manufacturing, electrical work, concrete work, controls, conveyors and insulation. We use subcontractors with whom we have good working relationships and review each project at the beginning and on an ongoing basis to help ensure that all work is being done according to our specifications. Subcontractors are generally paid when we are paid by our customers according to the terms of our contract with the customer. Our asset-light business model focuses on effective management of subcontractors and flow of raw and finished materials, which allows us to optimize working capital levels through reduction in certain assets and reduce capital expenditures.
 While we believe we have a good relationship with our suppliers and subcontractors, we are currently experiencing shortages of raw materials and inflationary pressures for certain materials and labor. We expect these supply chain challenges and cost impacts to continue for the foreseeable future as markets continue to recover and supply chains further normalize. Although we have secured additional raw materials from existing and alternate suppliers and have taken other mitigating actions to mitigate supply disruptions, we cannot guarantee that we can continue to do so in the future. In this event, our business, results and financial condition could be adversely affected.
Backlog
 Backlog (i.e., unfulfilled or remaining performance obligations) represents the sales we expect to recognize for our products and services for which control has not yet transferred to the customer. Backlog was $311.7 million as of December 31, 2022 as compared to $213.9 million as of December 31, 2021, an increase of $97.8 million or 45.7%. Backlog is adjusted on a quarterly basis for fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Substantially all backlog is expected to be delivered within 18 months, with a majority within 12 months. Backlog is not defined by United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and our methodology for calculating backlog may not be consistent with methodologies used by other companies.
Competition
 The markets we serve are highly fragmented with numerous small and regional participants. We believe no single company competes with us across the full range of our solutions and products. Competition in the markets we serve is based on a number of considerations, including past performance, track record, customer approvals, lead times, technology, applications experience, know-how, reputation, product warranties, service and price. Demand for our product can vary period over period depending on conditions in the markets we serve. We believe our product performance and quality, reliability, durability, on-time delivery, and safety supported by advanced engineering and operational excellence differentiate us from many of our competitors, including those competitors who often offer products at a lower price.
 Due to the size and shipping weight of many of our projects, localized manufacturing/fabrication capabilities are very important to our customers. As a result, competition varies widely by region and industry. The market for our engineered products is reasonably competitive and is characterized by technological stability, continuously evolving environmental regulations, and increasing customer requirements. We believe that the additional competitive factors in our markets include:
 •performance track record and reputation;
 •comprehensive portfolio of solutions;
 •brand recognition;
 •high design standard;
 •quality customer service and support; and
 •financial and operational stability.
 We believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors.
 Government Regulations
We believe our operations are in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We believe that changes in environmental laws and regulations create opportunity given the nature of our business.
Our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations. While there are not currently regulations proposed or pending that we believe will result in material capital, operating or other costs to the business at this time, such regulations could be proposed and/or passed into law in 2023 or beyond. Other regulations currently in place could be withdrawn and replaced with more stringent requirements in 2023 or beyond. New laws and regulations and the costs of compliance with such new laws and regulations can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more defined through regulatory guidance and enforcement.
Intellectual Property
 We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, employee and third-party nondisclosure/confidentiality agreements and license agreements to protect our intellectual property. We sell most of our products under a number of registered trade names, brand names and registered trademarks, which we believe are widely recognized in the industry. While we hold patents within a number of our businesses, we do not view our patents to be material to our business.
 Commitment to Values and Ethics
 
At CECO, we act in accordance with our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (“Code of Conduct”), which sets forth expectations and guidance for employees to make appropriate decisions. Our Code of Conduct covers topics such as anti-corruption, discrimination, harassment, data privacy, appropriate use of company assets, protecting confidential information, and reporting Code

of Conduct violations. The Code of Conduct reflects our commitment to operating in a fair, honest, responsible and ethical manner and also provides direction for reporting complaints in the event of alleged violations of our policies, including through an anonymous helpline. Our executive officers and managers maintain an “open door” policy, and any form of retaliation is strictly prohibited.
 
Human Capital Management
 
CECO recognizes that in order to drive innovation and operational excellence, we must identify, attract, retain and motivate world-class talent. As of December 31, 2022, CECO has approximately 1,000 employees, across nine countries. 126 of our US employees are unionized in our Pennsylvania, Tennessee and North Carolina facilities.
Talent, Leadership and People Development
 
To support personal and professional development, we have strategically committed resources to leadership and management development programs, product knowledge, job skills, and compliance training. In 2022, CECO continued to leverage an online learning platform so our employees can continue developing their skill sets and knowledge. Our learning platform offers over 16,000 courses and certifications ranging from job function to leadership and resource training. As of December 31, 2022, 85% of our employees have engaged with this learning platform and each is spending an average of approximately two hours per month building their knowledge and skills. Additionally, in 2021 we further invested in high performing leaders by partnering with top US Universities including Wharton, Yale, MIT University of CA Berkeley, University of Pennsylvania and more, to build strategic, leadership and operational excellence skills. We also partnered with the Center of Creative Leadership to further reinforce leadership skills by investing in executive level coaching of high performing leaders. We believe this investment in our team members and leaders results in a more knowledgeable and competent workforce today while strengthening our succession plan and leadership bench for the future.
 
We provide a variety of resources to help our employees grow in their current roles and build new skills to thrive in the workplace of the future. Strategic talent reviews are conducted annually across all business areas. Our Board of Directors ("Board") is updated on the Company’s people strategy on an annual basis, which is refined based on business drivers, market factors and key initiatives designed to drive the corporate strategy and business results and meets to review our succession planning strategy and leadership pipeline for key roles, taking into account the Company’s long-term strategy.

Health and Safety
 
At CECO, the health and safety of our employees is one of our highest priorities. We believe that all injuries, occupational illnesses and incidents are preventable, and we are committed to operating with a zero-incident culture. Through our environmental, health and safety program we implement policies and training programs, as well as perform self-audits to ensure our colleagues leave the workplace safely every day. To better understand employee safety at the site level, we have safety committees and safety scorecards to share best practices between sites.

We currently share scorecard information monthly to foster visibility, accountability and commitment across our workplace, communicating and celebrating successful results across the enterprise. In addition to lagging indicators, such as injury performance, the scorecards highlight leading indicators such as safety observations and near-misses, as well as other proactive actions taken at each site to ensure worker safety. For the year ended December 31, 2022, CECO’s domestic Total Recordable Incident Rate (“TRIR”) was 1.1% as compared to our benchmark industry average TRIR of 4.1%.

Diversity, Equity, and an Inclusive Culture
 
At CECO we believe a diverse and inclusive workforce is critical to inspiring innovative thinking, creative problem-solving, performance, and results, so we cultivate an environment where team members feel valued, engaged, and inspired to give their best. The unique characteristics that shape each individual help inform our decisions as a company, and this mindset allows CECO to realize new opportunities and add value to our customers, partners, and stockholders.

As part of our efforts to expand CECO’s diverse workforce, we:
 •initiated and implemented recruitment efforts to attract and build a more diverse workforce, including expanding career opportunity postings on career websites to diverse job boards, as well as search engines that aggregate and display job openings by employers, including those dedicated to diverse candidates;
 •are developing a comprehensive Diversity, Equity and Inclusive roadmap to align with our operational structure. 


CECO’s commitment to expanding our diverse workforce and enhancing our inclusive culture is driven by our recognition that a workplace that is reflective of our global customer base establishes a firm foundation to drive creativity and innovation, which lead to problem solving, development, performance, and business success.
