ITEM 1.    BUSINESS 
Overview 
 Veeva is the leading provider of industry cloud solutions for the global life sciences industry. We were founded in 2007 on the premise that industry-specific cloud solutions could best address the operating challenges and regulatory requirements of life sciences companies. Our solutions are designed to meet the unique needs of our customers and their most strategic business functions—from research and development (R&D) to commercialization. Our solutions are designed to help life sciences companies develop and bring products to market faster and more efficiently, market and sell more effectively, and maintain compliance with government regulations. 
 Customer success is one of our core values, and our focus on it has allowed us to deepen and expand our strategic relationships with customers over time. Because of our industry focus, we have a unique, in-depth perspective into the needs and best practices of life sciences companies. This allows us to develop targeted solutions, quickly adapt to regulatory changes, and incorporate highly relevant enhancements into our existing solutions at a rapid pace.
Our goal is to become the most strategic technology partner to the life sciences industry and achieve long-term leadership with our solutions that support the R&D and commercial functions of life sciences companies. Our commercial solutions help life sciences companies achieve better, more intelligent engagement with healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations across multiple communication channels, including face-to-face, email, and web. Our R&D solutions for the clinical, regulatory, quality, and, when available, safety functions help life sciences companies streamline their end-to-end product development processes to increase operational efficiency and maintain regulatory compliance throughout the product lifecycle.
We are now also bringing the benefits of our content and data management solutions to a new set of customers outside of life sciences in regulated industries, including consumer goods, chemicals, and cosmetics. We believe that the ability of our solutions to meet the demanding business and compliance requirements of life sciences companies translates well into many other regulated industries. Our application currently offered to companies outside of life sciences is designed to help customers efficiently manage critical regulated processes and content in a compliant way and to enable secure collaboration across internal and external stakeholders, including outsourcing partners and vendors.
 Executing in the Veeva Way
 Fundamental to our business model is what we call The Veeva Way. The Veeva Way is key to our disciplined approach to achieve our goal of long-term leadership in each of the product markets we serve.
 We start with a focus on addressing clear and correct target markets. Those are large product markets in which the problem being addressed by our solution is strategic to the businesses of our customers and in which we believe Veeva can become the leader over the long-term if we execute well. We embrace the concept of running to complexity, an approach in which we strive to solve the most important and challenging information technology problems our customers face. 
 We focus on delivering product excellence and cloud innovation. Our product development process begins with assembling and investing in strong product teams focused on building deep, best-in-class applications in every product market we serve. Through innovative cloud technology, we also aim to eliminate disparate systems by delivering unified application suites that work together on a common platform.

We strive to forge strong relationships with our customers and focus on customer success. When we enter a new product market, we begin with a small number of early adopter customers. We focus on learning from these early adopters and ensuring that they are successful with our products. Once successful, our early adopters have developed into vocal advocates, enabling our reference selling model.   
 Finally, our goal is to drive strong growth and profitability through highly efficient, targeted sales and marketing, disciplined product planning, and profitable professional services. Our strong growth and profitability has allowed us to make ongoing investments for continued product innovation in our existing markets and provides us with the resources to continue to invest in new market opportunities.

Our Employees 
 As of January 31, 2019, we employed 2,553 people worldwide. We also engage temporary employees and consultants. Our employees in the United States are not represented by a labor union, however, in certain foreign locations, there are workers’ councils that represent our employees. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be very good. 
Research and Development 
 Our R&D organization is responsible for the design, development, and testing of our solutions and applications. Based on customer feedback and needs, we focus our efforts on developing new solutions functionality, applications, and core technologies and further enhancing the usability, functionality, reliability, performance, and flexibility of existing solutions and applications.
Sales and Marketing 
 We sell our solutions through our direct sales organization. In large life sciences companies, the R&D and commercial business functions commonly have separate technology and business decision makers. Accordingly, we market and sell our solutions to align with the distinct characteristics of those decision makers. We have distinct R&D and commercial sales teams, which we further segment to focus on selling to large global life sciences companies and smaller life sciences companies. We also have a distinct sales team for our sales efforts to companies in regulated industries outside of life sciences. 
Technology Infrastructure and Operations 
 Our solutions utilize a pod-based architecture that allows for scalability, operational simplicity, and security. Our products are hosted in data centers located in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and Japan. We utilize third-parties to provide our computing infrastructure and manage the infrastructure on which our solutions operate. For example, for Veeva CRM and certain of our multichannel CRM applications, we utilize the hosting infrastructure provided by salesforce.com. For our Veeva Vault applications, Veeva Network applications, and certain other Veeva Commercial Cloud applications, we utilize Amazon Web Services.
 Our infrastructure providers employ advanced measures to ensure physical integrity and security, including redundant power and cooling systems, fire and flood prevention mechanisms, continual security coverage, biometric readers at entry points and anonymous exteriors. We also implement various disaster recovery measures such that data loss would be minimized in the event of a single data center disaster. We architect our solutions using redundant configurations to minimize service interruptions. We continually monitor our solutions for any sign of failure or pending failure, and we take preemptive action to attempt to minimize or prevent downtime.
 Our technology is based on multitenant architectures that apply common, consistent management practices for all customers using our solutions. We enable multiple customers to share the same version of our solutions while securely partitioning their respective data. Portions of our multichannel customer relationship management applications are built on the Salesforce1 Platform of salesforce.com inc. Veeva Vault, Veeva Network, and portions of our other Commercial Cloud applications are built upon our own proprietary platforms.

Quality and Compliance Program
 Veeva maintains a quality management system certified to ISO9001 to ensure process controls conform to established industry standards across our product offerings. To comply with IT healthcare regulations, certain capabilities such as robust audit trail tracking, compliant electronic signature capture, data encryption, and secure access controls must be designed for and embedded in our solutions. In addition to design requirements, our solutions must be thoroughly tested to comply with the regulations that apply to electronic record keeping systems for the life sciences industry, which include: 

Regulation | Regulation Description 
---------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
21 CFR 820.75 | U.S. FDA device regulation on system validation 
21 CFR 211.68 | U.S. FDA pharma GMP regulation on system validation 
21 CFR 11 | U.S. FDA requirement for maintenance of electronic records 
EU Annex 11 | EU GMP requirement for maintenance of electronic records 
21 CFR 203 | Drug sample tracking as required by the Prescription Drug Marketing Act 
PFSB Notification, No. 0401022 (Japan) | Use of Electromagnetic Records and Electronic Signatures for Approval of, or License for, Drugs

 
Each version of our solutions that are subject to regulations that require companies to maintain certain records and submit information to regulators as part of compliance verification undergoes validation testing against these and other relevant standards. 
 Security Program
 Veeva maintains an information security management system certified to ISO 27001 to ensure security controls conform to established standards across both product and infrastructure components. Our solution undergoes internal vulnerability testing prior to release, and we employ a third party to perform penetration and vulnerability tests on our solutions on at least an annual basis. We also obtain independent third-party audit opinions related to security and availability annually, such as SOC 2, Type II reports and ISO 27001 attestation reports. We also require role-based security and security awareness training and have defined security incident response processes.
Privacy Program
 Veeva maintains a global privacy program aligned to applicable laws and regulations, including the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Veeva also maintains an EU-U.S. Privacy Shield certification and a Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield certification in order to allow the transfer of EU and Swiss personal data to the United States. In addition, Veeva maintains privacy policies and procedures and requires role-based privacy awareness training. 
Competition
 The markets for our solutions are global, rapidly evolving, highly competitive, and subject to changing regulations, advancing technology, and shifting customer needs. In new sales cycles, we generally compete with other cloud-based solutions from providers that make applications geared toward the life sciences industry. The principal such competitor for our Veeva Commercial Cloud applications is IQVIA Inc. (which offers a CRM application built on the Salesforce1 Platform, various data products, and other applications). While no single vendor offers products that compete with all of our Veeva Vault applications, IQVIA, Medidata Solutions, Inc., OpenText Corporation, Oracle Corporation, and other smaller application providers offer applications that compete with certain of our Veeva Vault applications. 
 Our Commercial Cloud and Veeva Vault application suites also compete to replace client server-based legacy solutions offered by companies such as Oracle, Microsoft Corporation, and other smaller application providers. Our customers may also choose to use horizontal cloud-based applications or platforms that are not life sciences specific—such as Box.com, Amazon Web Services, or Microsoft—for certain of the functions our applications provide. 
 8 Veeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K


Our data products compete with IQVIA and other smaller data providers.
We sell certain of our Veeva Vault applications to companies outside the life sciences industry. In this segment of our business, we compete with solutions such as those offered by OpenText, Microsoft, Sparta Systems Inc., EtQ Management Consultants, LLC, Oracle, and Box and custom-built software developed by third-party vendors or in-house by our potential customers.
 Our professional services offerings compete with a range of professional services firms. 
 Some of our actual and potential competitors have advantages over us, such as longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing or other resources, stronger brand and business recognition, larger intellectual property portfolios, and agreements with a broader set of system integrators and other partners. We expect competition to intensify in the future, and we may face competition from new market entrants as well. 
 We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following: 
  
• | level of customer satisfaction;
--+--------------------------------


• | regulatory compliance verification and functionality;
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | domain expertise with respect to life sciences;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | ease of deployment and use of solutions and applications;
--+----------------------------------------------------------

• | modern and adaptive technology platform;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | capability for customization, configurability, integration, security, scalability and reliability of applications;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | total cost of ownership;
--+-------------------------


• | ability to innovate and respond to customer needs rapidly;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | size of customer base and level of user adoption;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | ability to secure the rights to load and process third party proprietary data licensed by customers; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ability to integrate with legacy enterprise infrastructures and third-party applications.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that we generally compete favorably on the basis of these factors.

Intellectual Property 
 We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contractual protections, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We have developed a process for seeking patent protection for our technology innovations. As of January 31, 2019, we have secured 17 U.S. patents, three Japanese patents, and two Chinese patents, which expire between May 2023 and January 2038, and we have over 40 pending U.S. and international patent applications. Our patents and patent applications cover technology within the following of our product categories: Veeva Commercial Cloud, Veeva Vault Platform, Veeva Vault Clinical, Veeva Vault RIM, Veeva Vault CDMS, and Veeva Vault Safety. We plan to continue expanding our patent portfolio. We require our employees, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements and control access to software, documentation and other proprietary information. Although we rely on our intellectual property rights, as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our proprietary rights, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new features and functionality and frequent enhancements to our applications are essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position as provider of software solutions and applications to the life sciences industry. 
 Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop applications with the same functionality as our application. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult, and protection of our rights through civil enforcement mechanisms may be expensive and time consuming. 
 Companies in our industry often own a number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property or other rights. We are currently engaged in legal proceedings with competitors in which the competitors are asserting trade secret misappropriation and other claims, and we may face new allegations in the future that we have infringed the patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights of other competitors or non-practicing entities. We expect that we and others in our industry will continue to be subject to third-party infringement claims by competitors as the functionality of applications in different industry segments overlaps, and by non-practicing entities. Any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us at any time. For example, see the description of our current litigations in note 13 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.
