ITEM 1. BUSINESS
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
 
THE COMPANY
 
Biomerica, Inc. ("Biomerica", the "Company", "we", us or "our") was incorporated in Delaware in September 1971 as Nuclear Medical Systems, Inc. The Company has two wholly owned subsidiaries, Biomerica de Mexico, which is used for assembly/ manufacturing and BioEurope GmbH, which acts as a distributor of Biomerica products in certain markets. 
 
The Company develops, manufactures, and markets medical diagnostic products designed for the early detection and monitoring of chronic diseases and medical conditions. Our medical diagnostic products are sold worldwide in two markets: 1) clinical laboratories and 2) point of care (physicians' offices and over-the-counter drugstores). The diagnostic test kits are used to analyze blood, urine, or fecal specimens from patients in the diagnosis of various diseases and other medical complications, by measuring or detecting the existence and/or level of specific bacteria, hormones, antibodies, antigens or other substances, which may exist in a patients body, stools, or blood, often in extremely small concentrations.
 
We primarily focus on products for gastrointestinal diseases, food intolerances, diabetes and certain esoteric tests. These diagnostic test products utilize immunoassay technology. Our products are CE marked and/or sold for diagnostic use around the world where they are registered by each countrys regulatory agency. In addition, some products are cleared for sale in the U.S. by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 
 
Technological advances in medical diagnostics have made it possible to perform diagnostic tests within the home and the physician's office (the point of care), rather than in the clinical laboratory. One of our objectives has been to develop and market rapid diagnostic tests that are accurate, employ easily obtained specimens, and are simple to perform without instrumentation. Our over-the-counter and professional rapid diagnostic products help to manage existing medical conditions and may save lives through early detection and prompt diagnosis. In the past, tests of this kind required the services of medical technologists and sophisticated instrumentation. Frequently, results were not available until at least the following day. We believe that rapid point of care tests can be as accurate as laboratory tests when used properly, require limited to no instrumentation, give reliable results in minutes and can be performed with confidence in the home or the physician's office.
 
 Biomerica maintains its headquarters in Irvine, California where it houses administration, product development, sales and marketing, customer services and some manufacturing operations. Biomerica also maintains manufacturing and assembly operations in Mexicali, Mexico, in order to reduce the cost of manufacturing and compete more effectively worldwide. The Company expends considerable funds in research and development of certain new products that diagnose and, in certain cases, are designed to be used as a therapy for several major medical diseases. These products are both internally developed and licensed from others. We utilize experienced technical personnel to improve existing products, develop new products and evaluate and implement technology technical transfers activities. We are currently pursuing the development of multiple tests for the gastrointestinal market.
 
PRODUCTION
 
Most of our diagnostic test kits are manufactured and/or assembled at our facilities in Irvine, California and in Mexicali, Mexico. We established our manufacturing facility in Mexicali, Mexico in fiscal 2003 and moved a significant portion of our diagnostic production (primarily our packaging and assembly) to that facility. 
 
Production of diagnostic tests can involve formulating component antibodies and antigens in specified concentrations, attaching a tracer to the antigen, filling components into vials, packaging and labeling. We continually engage in quality control procedures to assure the consistency and quality of our products and to comply with applicable FDA and international regulations. 
 
Our manufacturing operations and facilities are regulated by the FDA Good Manufacturing Practices for medical devices. We have an internal Quality department that monitors and evaluates product quality and output. We also have an internal Quality Systems department whose goal is to ensure that our operating procedures are in compliance with current FDA, CE Mark and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) regulations. We either produce our own antibodies and antigens or purchase these materials from qualified vendors. We have alternate, approved sources for most critical raw materials and are working to procure alternate sources for the few that we do not have. Based on our experience, we do not believe that material availability in the foreseeable future will be a problem.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 
We are currently developing and pursuing the regulatory approval of two tests for the gastrointestinal market.  Our increase in research and development spending is due to our focus on these tests and studies to demonstrate the feasibility of possible FDA clearance for such tests. The Company also utilizes technical personnel to conduct other development activities and improve existing products, as well as explore potential new technologies that the Company may wish to develop. Research and development expenses include the costs of materials, supplies, personnel, consultants, legal fees, facilities and equipment as well as outside contract services. Consolidated research and development expenses incurred by Biomerica for the years ended May 31, 2019 and 2018 aggregated $1,679,098, and $1,398,368, respectively. 
 
The Company has developed a unique diagnostic guided therapy (DGT) that is designed to allow physicians to identify patient-specific foods (e.g. pork, milk, onions, sugar, chickpeas, etc.), that when removed from the diet, may alleviate or improve an individual's symptoms of IBS. This product is called InFoods® IBS and is currently is in clinical studies at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Inc., a Harvard Medical School Teaching Hospital, and at the University of Michigan. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has issued the Company a patent for the InFoods® IBS product. Further, we are also developing, and have filed patents for other diseases in the InFoods® family of products, which include:  Functional Dyspepsia, Crohns Disease, Ulcerative Colitis and Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). 
 
The Company is also in clinical studies to evaluate the performance of its new and proprietary Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) test.  The clinical studies are being conducted at the University of Southern California (USC), a European University and several other U.S. locations. The patient clinical studies are expected to take less than 6 months to complete. The Company will then need to complete the analytical studies and prepare for submission to the FDA and plans to utilize a 510(k) pathway clearance of the test. Biomericas test is designed to increase the sensitivity and specificity of H. pylori testing and monitoring of treatment. 
 
We are planning to pursue a de novo 510(k) clearance with the FDA rather than a Premarket Approval Application (PMA) for the InFoods® IBS product. De novo clearance is typically faster and less expensive than the PMA route, which is the most stringent type of device marketing application required by the FDA. We expect to submit the H. pylori product using a 510(k) application. 
 
MARKETS AND METHODS OF DISTRIBUTION
 
Biomerica has approximately 340 current customers for its diagnostic business, of which approximately 100 are foreign distributors, 40 are domestic distributors and the balance are primarily domestic hospital and clinical laboratories, medical research institutions, medical schools, pharmaceutical companies, chain drugstores, wholesalers and physicians' offices.
 
We have recently added a director of sales and marketing for Europe and South America who is headquartered in Germany.  This new director joins Biomerica with 22 years of experience selling and marketing Diagnostic and Life Science products across multiple diagnostics technologies and disciplines. She possesses broad international business experience, with communication skills in German, English, Spanish, French and Portuguese, and scientific and technical understanding of gastrointestinal diagnostic products. She also has strong relationships with key strategic entities in Europe, Eastern Europe, Latin America, Canada and U.S. that we believe will help Biomerica add new distributors for existing products, and add new product-lines for future distribution by the Company. In her previous role, this director managed relationships that accounted for approximately 50% of the employer Groups sales. 
 
We rely on affiliated and unaffiliated distributors, advertising in medical and trade journals, exhibitions at trade shows, direct mailings and an internal sales staff to market our diagnostic products. We target two main markets: (a) clinical laboratories and (b) point of care testing (physicians' offices and over-the-counter drug stores).

For the years ended May 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had two distributors and one distributor which accounted for 46.3% and 43.3%, respectively, of net consolidated sales.  
 
BACKLOG
 
At May 31, 2019 and 2018, Biomerica had a backlog of unshipped orders of approximately $207,000 and $268,000 respectively.
 
RAW MATERIALS
 
The principal raw materials utilized by Biomerica consist of various chemicals, serums, reagents and packaging supplies. Almost all of our raw materials are available from several sources, and we are not dependent upon any single source of supply or a few suppliers. However, due to the limited number of suppliers of some materials, especially those such as antibodies, there is always the possibility that the Company may encounter difficulty in the future obtaining key raw materials for its manufacturing processes or that such materials may be exceedingly costly. For the year ended May 31, 2019, one vendor accounted for 23.8% of our purchases of raw materials. For the year ended May 31, 2018, two vendors accounted for 27.7% of our purchases of raw materials. 
 
Our inventory consists of various types of materials including antibodies, antigens, bottles, boxes, various chemicals and reagents utilized in the manufacture of our test kits as well as products in various stages of completion.
 
COMPETITION
 
Immunodiagnostic products are currently produced by more than 100 companies. Biomerica is not a significant player in the overall market.
 
Our competitors vary greatly in size. Many are divisions or subsidiaries of well-established medical and pharmaceutical companies which are much larger than Biomerica and expend substantially greater amounts than we do for research and development, manufacturing, advertising and marketing.
 
The primary competitive factors affecting the sale of diagnostic products are uniqueness, technology, quality of product, performance, price, service and marketing. We believe we compete primarily on the basis of the uniqueness of our products, the quality of our products, the speed of our test results, our patent position, our pricing and our prompt shipment of orders. We offer a broader range of products than many competitors of comparable size, but have had limited marketing capability. We are working on expanding this capability through marketing and strategic cooperation with larger companies and distributors as well as hiring new marketing and sales expertise. 
 
GOVERNMENT REGULATION OF OUR DIAGNOSTIC BUSINESS
 
Our primary business consists of selling products that are legally defined to be in vitro diagnostic and medical devices. As a result, we are considered to be an in vitro diagnostic and medical device manufacturer, and as such are subject to the regulations of numerous governmental entities. These agencies include the FDA, Environmental Protection Agency, Federal Trade Commission, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, U.S. Department of Agriculture ("USDA"), and Consumer Product Safety Commission. These activities are also regulated by various agencies of the states and localities in which our products are sold. These regulations govern the introduction of new medical devices, the observance of certain standards with respect to the manufacture and labeling of medical devices, the maintenance of certain records, the reporting of potential product problems, and other matters.
 
The Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act of 1938 (the "FDCA") regulates medical devices in the United States by classifying them into one of three classes based on the extent of regulation believed necessary to ensure safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are those devices for which safety and effectiveness can reasonably be assured through general controls, such as device listing, adequate labeling, and adherence to the Quality System Regulation ("QSR") as well as Medical Device Reporting (MDR), labeling and other regulatory requirements. Some Class I medical devices are exempt from the requirement of Pre-Market Notification or clearance. Class II devices are those devices for which safety and effectiveness can reasonably be ensured through the use of special controls, such as performance standards, post-market surveillance and patient registries, as well as adherence to the general controls provisions applicable to Class I devices. Class III devices are devices that generally must receive clearance prior to marketing by the FDA pursuant to a pre-market approval to ensure their safety and effectiveness. Generally, Class III devices are limited to life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices. However, this classification can also apply to novel technology or new intended uses or applications for existing devices. The Company's products are primarily either Class I or Class II medical devices.

Pursuant to FDA requirements, we have registered our manufacturing facility with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer, and listed the medical devices we manufacture. We are also subject to inspection on a routine basis for compliance with FDA regulations. This includes the QSR, which requires that we manufacture our products and maintain our documents in a prescribed manner with respect to issues such as design controls, manufacturing, testing and validation activities. Further, we are required to comply with other FDA requirements with respect to labeling, and MDR regulation which requires that we provide information to the FDA on deaths or serious injuries alleged to have been associated with the use of our products, as well as product malfunctions that are likely to cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. We believe that we are currently in material compliance with all relevant QSR and MDR requirements.
 
In addition, our facility is required to have a California Medical Device Manufacturing License. The license is not transferable and must be renewed biannually. Approval of the license requires that we be in compliance with QSR, labeling and MDR regulations. Our current license expires on December 31, 2019. These licenses are renewed periodically, and to date we have never failed to obtain a renewal.
 
Through compliance with FDA and California regulations, we can market some of our medical devices throughout the United States. International sales of medical devices are also subject to the regulatory requirements of each country. In Europe, the directives of the European Union (EU) require that a device have a "CE Mark" in order to be sold in EU countries. The directive went into effect beginning December 7, 2003. The Company has completed the process for complying with the "CE Mark" directives; and In Vitro Diagnostics Directive 98/79/EC. We also comply with ISO 13485 for medical devices Quality Management Systems. 
 
At present, outside the EU the regulatory international review process varies from country to country. We, in general, rely upon our distributors and sales representatives in the foreign countries in which we market our products to ensure that we comply with the regulatory laws of those countries. We believe that our international sales to date have been in compliance with the laws of all foreign countries in which we have made sales. Exports of most medical devices are also subject to certain FDA regulatory controls.
 
Biomerica is licensed to design, develop, manufacture and distribute in vitro diagnostic and medical devices and is subject to the Code of Federal Regulations, Section 21, parts 800 - 1299. The FDA is the governing body that assesses and issues Biomerica's license to assure that it complies with these regulations. Biomerica is currently licensed, and its last assessment was in February 2015. During the inspection, the FDA noted five observations that were corrected in a timely manner. Biomerica is also registered and licensed with the State of California's Department of Health Services. The last audit with the State of California was in November 2009 and no observations were noted. The Company believes that all Biomerica products sold in the U.S. comply with the FDA and state regulations.
 
Biomerica's Quality Management System is in compliance with the EN ISO 13485:2016. EN ISO 13485:2016 is an internationally recognized standard in which companies establish their methods of operation and commitment to quality.   
SEASONALITY OF BUSINESS
 
The businesses of the Company and its subsidiaries have not been subject to significant seasonal fluctuations.

We recognize that our foreign sales could be subject to some special or unusual risks, which are not present in the ordinary course of business in the United States. Changes in economic factors, government regulations, terrorism, tariffs and import restrictions all could impact sales within certain foreign countries. In addition, these factors could also impact the ability of the Company to collect foreign accounts receivable. Foreign countries have licensing requirements applicable to the sale of diagnostic products, which vary substantially from domestic requirements; depending upon the product and the foreign country, these may be more or less restrictive than requirements within the United States. Foreign diagnostic sales at Biomerica are made primarily through a network of approximately 100 independent distributors in approximately 65 countries.
 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
We regard the protection of our methodologies, designs, product formulations, manufacturing processes, diagnostic procedures, copyrights, service marks, trademarks and trade secrets as important to our future success. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patents, service mark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights in products and services. We have entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and nondisclosure agreements with most of our fulfillment partners and strategic partners to limit access to and disclosure of proprietary information. We cannot be certain that these contractual arrangements or the other steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property will prevent misappropriation of our technology. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks, patents or copyrighted material, to third parties. While we attempt to ensure that the quality of our product brands is maintained by such licensees, we cannot be certain that such licensees will not take actions that might hurt the value of our proprietary rights or reputation.
BRANDS, TRADEMARKS, PATENTS, LICENSES
 
We registered the tradenames "Fortel", "Isletest", and "GAP" with the Office of Patents and Trademarks on December 31, 1985. We registered the tradename InFoods on December 24, 2016. Our unregistered tradenames are "EZ-Detect", "EZ-H.P." and "EZ-PSA". A trademark for "Aware" was issued and assigned in November 2001 and renewed in 2011. Biomerica has acquired from third parties the rights to manufacture and sell certain products. In some cases, royalties are paid on the sales of these products. Biomerica anticipates that it will license or purchase the rights to other products or technologies in the future.  Biomerica has filed twenty-two provisional patent applications with regard to new tests to identify possible triggers for causing specific symptoms to multiple diseases.  The International Search Authority (ISA) has deemed that for one of Biomericas patents pertaining to Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), all the International Patent Application claims for its composition and methods to identify trigger foods for IBS are novel and non-obvious.
 
The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. Effective copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may not be available in such jurisdictions. Our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights may not prevent misappropriation of our content. In addition, there can be no assurance that Biomerica is not violating any third-party patents.
 
In August 2018, the Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO) issued a Certificate of Patent covering Biomericas compositions, devices and methods of IBS sensitivity testing (entitled COMPOSITIONS, DEVICES, AND METHODS OF IBS SENSIVITY TESTING). The patent specifically applies to Biomericas InFoods® IBS product, which is currently in a clinical study in the U.S.  This patent is the first for the InFoods® patent portfolio, providing patent protection for InFoods® IBS in Korea until November 13, 2035.
 
The Company has one royalty agreement in which it has obtained rights to manufacture and market certain products for the life of the products. Royalty expense of approximately $19,000 is included in cost of sales for this agreement for the years ended May 31, 2019 and 2018. Sales of products manufactured under this agreement comprises approximately 2.9% and 2.6% of total sales for the years ended May 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company may license other products or technology in the future as it deems necessary or opportunistic for conducting business.

U.S. PATENT ALLOWANCE
 
The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has issued a Notice of Allowance for Biomericas first U.S. patent pertaining to the Companys InFoods® IBS product. Specifically, this allowed application (#15/526,240) contains numerous claims that broadly cover a product that enables physicians to identify patient specific foods (e.g. pork, milk, shrimp, broccoli, chickpeas, etc.), that when removed, may alleviate or improve an individual's IBS symptoms, including but not limited to constipation, diarrhea, bloating, pain and indigestion. This patent is the first US patent allowed for the InFoods® IBS product, providing patent protection for InFoods® IBS in the U.S. until November, 2035. The Company is pursuing patents for the InFoods® platform technology in several other disease states as well as increasing the coverage for the IBS product.   
EMPLOYEES
 
As of May 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company employed 39 employees. Various employees listed in the production department also perform research and development duties as a routine function of their job. The Company also employed four people in 2019 and three people in 2018 who are working on a contractual basis. The following is a breakdown between departments:

 | 2019 | 2018
--------------------------+------+-----
Administrative | 4 | 5 
Research and Development | 8 | 6 
Marketing & Sales | 4 | 3 
Production and Operations | 23 | 25 
Total | 39 | 39 

 
In addition, Biomerica de Mexico employs 15 people at its Mexico facility. We also engage the services of various outside Ph.D. and M.D. consultants as well as medical institutions for technical support on a regular basis. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and have never experienced a work stoppage. We consider our employee relations to be good.
