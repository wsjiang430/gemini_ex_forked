 ITEM 1.          BUSINESS
 Company Overview
 Corporate Vision:  To drive the advancement of women’s health by providing innovative methods to detect, monitor and manage the treatment of both benign and malignant gynecologic disease, with our primary focus being diseases of the female pelvic cavity. 
 Our corporate strategy is to serve as a diagnostic service and bio-analytic solutions provider. Our plan is to broaden our commercial focus from ovarian cancer to differential diagnosis of women with a range of gynecological disorders. We are currently in the market expansion and growth phase of our strategy having added to our direct sales force in late 2018 and into the first quarter of 2019.      We expanded our commercial strategy in 2018 through the establishment of medical and advisory support and a Key Opinion Leader Network aligned with our territories in the US. We ultimately plan to globally commercialize OVA1 and Overa by utilizing the full national licensure of ASPiRA LABS, select laboratories for distribution, managed care coverage in select markets, our sales force and existing customer base.  During 2018 we put OVA1, as we have with Overa, on a global testing platform, which allows both tests to be deployed internationally as well as run locally in the United States at major customer sites.  We initiated the targeted launch of Overa in October 2016 with two key accounts converting from OVA1 to Overa. In October 2015, we announced registration of the CE mark for and clearance to market Overa in the European Union. We also plan to develop an LDT product series, which we refer to internally as Diagnostic Algorithms #1 (“DxA1”) and Diagnostic Algorithms #2 (“DxA2”).  We anticipate that DxA1 and DxA2 will include not only biomarkers, but also clinical risk factors, other diagnostics and patient history data in order to boost predictive value. During the third and fourth quarters of 2018, we reorganized internally and reinvested in a stronger sales and marketing team in order to better position our new commercial offerings.
 ﻿Mission Statement:  We are dedicated to the discovery, development and commercialization of novel high-value diagnostic and bio-analytical solutions that help physicians diagnose, treat and improve outcomes for women. Our tests are intended to detect, characterize and stage disease, and to help guide decisions regarding patient treatment, which may include decisions to refer patients to specialists, to perform additional testing, or to assist in monitoring response to therapy. A distinctive feature of our approach is the combination of multi-modal diagnostics and data. Our goal is to combine multiple biomarkers, other modalities and diagnostics, clinical risk factors and patient data into a single, reportable index score that has higher diagnostic accuracy than its constituents. We concentrate our development of novel diagnostic tests for gynecologic disease, with an initial focus on ovarian cancer. We also intend to address clinical questions related to early disease detection, treatment response, monitoring of disease progression, prognosis and others through collaborations with leading academic and research institutions. 
 Business:  Our initial product, OVA1, is a blood test designed to, in addition to a physician’s clinical assessment of a woman with a pelvic mass, identify women who are at high risk of having a malignant ovarian tumor prior to planned surgery. The FDA cleared OVA1 in September 2009, and we commercially launched OVA1 in March 2010. We have launched on a targeted basis a second-generation biomarker panel known as Overa, which is intended to maintain our product’s high sensitivity while improving specificity.  We received FDA clearance for Overa on March 18, 2016. OVA1 and Overa use the Roche cobas 4000, 6000 and 8000 platforms.
 In June 2014, we launched ASPiRA LABS, a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (“CLIA”) certified national laboratory which specializes in applying biomarker-based technologies, to address critical needs in the management of gynecologic cancers and disease. ASPiRA LABS provides expert diagnostic services using a state-of-the-art biomarker-based diagnostic algorithm to aid in clinical decision making and advance personalized treatment plans. The lab currently processes our OVA1 and Overa tests, and we plan to expand the testing to other gynecologic conditions with high unmet need. We also plan to develop and perform LDTs at ASPiRA LABS.  ASPiRA LABS holds a CLIA Certificate of Registration and a state laboratory license in California, Florida, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. This allows the lab to process OVA1 on a national basis. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) issued a provider number to ASPiRA LABS in March 2015.
 Strategy:  We are focused on the execution of four core strategic business drivers in ovarian cancer diagnostics and specialized laboratory services to build long-term value for our investors: 
 ﻿

1) | Maximizing the existing OVA1 opportunity in the United States by leading in payer coverage and commercialization of OVA1. This strategy included the launch of a CLIA certified clinical laboratory, ASPiRA LABS, in June 2014, multiple publications, inclusion in the ACOG adnexal mass guidelines, payer traction and finally the addition of OVA1 to CMS National Fee schedule as of January 2018;

  ﻿

2) | Expanding the distribution platform beyond the U.S. by launching Overa, a next generation biomarker panel, on a targeted basis while building the clinical utility and health economics foundation of both OVA1 and Overa, which we 3

believe may allow for better domestic market penetration and international expansion (FDA clearance for Overa was received in March 2016);
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

3) | Leveraging our existing database and specimen bank while building the largest specimen and data repository of gynecologic pelvic mass patients worldwide; and
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

4) | Expanding our product offerings to additional pelvic disease conditions such as endometriosis and polycystic ovarian syndrome (“PCOS”) by adding additional gynecologic bio-analytic solutions involving biomarkers, other modalities (e.g., imaging), clinical risk factors and patient data to aid diagnosis and risk stratification of women presenting with a pelvic mass disease.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 We believe that these business drivers will contribute significantly to addressing unmet medical needs for women faced with gynecologic disease and other conditions and the continued development of our business.
 Our Product
 OVA1 addresses a clear clinical need, namely the pre-surgical identification of women who are at high risk of having a malignant ovarian tumor. Numerous studies have documented the benefit of referral of these women to gynecologic oncologists for their initial surgery. Prior to the clearance of OVA1, no blood test had been cleared by the FDA for physicians to use in the pre-surgical management of ovarian adnexal masses. OVA1 and Overa are qualitative serum tests that utilize five well-established biomarkers and proprietary software cleared as part of the OVA1 510(k) to determine the likelihood of malignancy in women over age 18, with a pelvic mass for whom surgery is planned. OVA1 or Overa should not be used without an independent clinical/radiological evaluation and is not intended to be a screening test or to determine whether a patient should proceed to surgery. Incorrect use of OVA1 or Overa carries the risk of unnecessary testing, surgery and/or delayed diagnosis. OVA1 was developed through large pre-clinical studies in collaboration with numerous academic medical centers encompassing over 2,500 clinical samples. OVA1 was fully validated in a prospective multi-center clinical trial encompassing 27 sites reflective of the diverse nature of the clinical centers at which ovarian adnexal masses are evaluated.
 In March 2015, we entered into a new commercial agreement with Quest Diagnostics.  Pursuant to this agreement, all OVA1 U.S. testing services for Quest Diagnostics customers were transferred to Vermillion’s wholly-owned subsidiary, ASPiRA LABS, as of August 2015. Pursuant to this agreement, as amended as of March 1, 2018, Quest Diagnostics has continued to provide blood draw and logistics support by transporting specimens to ASPiRA LABS for testing in exchange for a market value fee.   Per the terms of the commercial agreement, we may not offer to existing or future Quest Diagnostics customers CA 125-II or other tests that Quest Diagnostics offers. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are in the process of renewing this agreement..  
 We have active international distribution agreements for Overa with Pro-Genetics LTD in Israel and MacroHealth, Inc. in the Philippines. The MacroHealth, Inc. agreement was our first decentralized international agreement with Overa specimen testing to be performed in the Philippines.

In the United States, revenue for diagnostic tests comes from several sources, including third-party payers such as insurance companies, government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, client bill accounts and patients. Novitas Solutions, a Medicare contractor, covers and reimburses for OVA1 tests performed in certain states, including Texas. Because OVA1 tests are exclusively performed at ASPiRA LABS in Texas, this local coverage determination from Novitas Solutions essentially provides national coverage for patients enrolled in Medicare as well as Medicare Advantage health plans. 
 In October 2016, we launched our pelvic mass specimen and data repository and began the collection of patient consents under Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) for collection and cataloguing of serum samples for future research purposes.
 In November 2016, The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ("ACOG”) issued Practice Bulletin Number 174, which included OVA1 as a “Multivariate Index Assay”. This bulletin outlines ACOG's “new” clinical management guidelines for adnexal mass management.  
 These new clinical management guidelines replace the July 2007 version, Practice Bulletin Number 83. Practice Bulletins summarize current information on techniques and clinical management issues for the practice of obstetrics and gynecology. Practice Bulletins are evidence-based documents, and recommendations are based on the evidence. This is also the only clinical management tool used for adnexal masses. Although there are Practice Bulletins, guidelines do not exist for adnexal masses. ACOG guidelines do exist, however, for ovarian cancer management.  
 Practice Bulletin Number 83 recommends that obstetricians and gynecologists evaluating women with adnexal masses who do not meet Level A criteria of a low risk transvaginal ultrasound should proceed with Level B clinical guidelines. Level B guidelines state that the physician may use risk assessment tools such as existing CA125 technology or OVA1 (“Multivariate Index Assay”) as listed in the bulletin. Based on this, OVA1 has now achieved parity with CA125 as a Level B clinical recommendation for the

management of adnexal masses. In December 2016, we received an FDA Clarification Letter regarding OVA1 and Overa. This letter was in reference to the September 7, 2016 FDA Safety Communication advising women and their physicians against the use of ovarian cancer screening tests for asymptomatic women.
 In order to avoid any confusion, as well as to document the FDA position on OVA1 and Overa, Jeffrey Shuren, M.D, J.D, Director for the Center for Devices and Radiological Health at the FDA, sent a letter to Vermillion, dated December 21, 2016. In the letter, Dr. Shuren stated,
 “We agree that this safety communication does not apply to Vermillion’s FDA-cleared tests, OVA1 (MIA) and Overa (MIA2G), which are not screening tests for ovarian cancer.
 “FDA cleared OVA1 (MIA) and Overa (MIA2G) as aids to further assess the likelihood that malignancy is present when the physician’s independent clinical and radiological evaluation does not indicate malignancy. The intended uses of the two assays are the same—to help physicians more reliably identify which patients would benefit from consultation with or referral to a gynecologic oncologist. OVA1 (MIA) and Overa (MIA2G) are indicated for women who present with an adnexal mass.”    Studies and Publications

 The Diagnostic Market
 The economics of healthcare demand effective and efficient allocation of resources which can be accomplished through disease prevention, early detection of disease leading to early intervention, and diagnostic tools that can triage patients to more appropriate therapy and intervention. In September 2017, Allied Market Research, a market research and business consulting partnership, published a study that forecasts IVD market revenue will reach $84 billion by 2023. We have chosen to concentrate our business focus in the areas of oncology and women’s health where we have established strong key opinion leaders, and provider and patient relationships. Demographic trends suggest that, as the population ages, the burden from gynecologic diseases, including cancers, will increase and the demand for quality diagnostic, prognostic and predictive tests will escalate. In addition, the areas of 

 
6

 
oncology and women’s health generally lack quality diagnostic tests and, therefore, we believe patient outcomes can be significantly improved by the development of novel diagnostic tests. 
 Our focus on translational biomarkers and informatics enables us to address the market for novel diagnostic tests that simultaneously measure multiple biomarkers. A biomarker is a biomolecule or variant biomolecule that is present at measurably greater or lesser concentrations in a disease state versus a normal condition. Conventional protein tests measure a single protein biomarker whereas most diseases are complex. We believe that efforts to diagnose cancer and other complex diseases have failed in large part because the disease is heterogeneous at the causative level (i.e., most diseases can be traced to multiple potential etiologies) and at the human response level (i.e., each individual afflicted with a given disease can respond to that ailment in a specific manner). 
 Consequently, measuring a single biomarker when multiple biomarkers may be altered in a complex disease is unlikely to provide meaningful information about the disease state. We believe that our approach of monitoring and combining multiple biomarkers using a variety of analytical techniques has allowed and will continue to allow us to create diagnostic tests with sufficient sensitivity and specificity about the disease state to aid the physician considering treatment options for patients with complex diseases. Such assays are commonly referred to as IVDMIA (also known as In Vitro Diagnostic Multivariate Index Assays), and often utilize advanced algorithms based on logistic regression, pattern recognition and the like. Often, IVDMIA algorithms are non-intuitive, and therefore require rigorous clinical validation and error modeling. Vermillion and its collaborators are considered experts in these areas and, in the case of OVA1, presented both the clinical validation and error modeling needed in order to gain 510(k) clearance of OVA1 as an IVD software device.
 Ovarian Cancer
 Background    Commonly known as the “silent killer,” ovarian cancer leads to approximately 14,000 deaths each year in the United States. As of early 2019, The American Cancer Society (“ACS”) estimated that over 22,000 new ovarian cancer cases will be diagnosed, with the majority of patients diagnosed in the late stages of the disease in which the cancer has spread beyond the ovary. Unfortunately, ovarian cancer patients in the late stages of the disease have a poor prognosis, which leads to high mortality rates. According to the ACS, when ovarian cancer is diagnosed at its earliest stage, Stage 1A, the patient has a 5-year survival rate of 94%. Ovarian cancer patients have up to a 90% 5-year survival rate following surgery and/or chemotherapy if detected in stage 1. However, only 15% of ovarian cancer patients are diagnosed before the tumor has spread outside the ovary. For ovarian cancer patients diagnosed in the late-stages of the disease, the 5-year survival rate falls to as low as 17%. 
 While the diagnosis of ovarian cancer in its earliest stages greatly increases the likelihood of long-term survival from the disease, another factor that predicts clinical outcomes from ovarian cancer is the specialized training of the surgeon who operates on the ovarian cancer patient. Numerous studies have demonstrated that treatment of malignant ovarian tumors by specialists such as gynecologic oncologists or at specialist medical centers improves outcomes for women with these tumors. Published guidelines from the SGO and the ACOG recommend referral of women with malignant ovarian tumors to specialists. Unfortunately, we believe only about one-third of women with these types of tumors are operated on by specialists, in part because of inadequate diagnostics that can identify such malignancies with high sensitivity. Accordingly, there is a clinical need for a diagnostic test that can provide adequate predictive value to stratify patients with a pelvic mass into those with a high risk of invasive ovarian cancer versus those with a low risk of ovarian cancer, which is essential for improving overall survival in patients with ovarian cancer. 
 Although adnexal masses are relatively common, malignant tumors are less so. Screening studies have indicated that the prevalence of simple ovarian cysts in women 55 years of age and older can be as high as 14%.[1] Adnexal masses are thought to be even more common in premenopausal women, but there are more non-persistent, physiologic ovarian masses in this demographic group. For instance, in the University of Kentucky ovarian cancer screening project, the rate of postmenopausal women with persistently abnormal ultrasound findings requiring surgery was 1.4%.[2]  According to 2010 U.S. census data, there are 36.8 million women between the ages of 50 and 70 in the U.S., suggesting that there are more than 500,000 suspicious adnexal masses in this segment alone. Those that do require evaluation for the likelihood for malignancy could potentially benefit from the use of OVA1 or Overa.
 The ACOG Ovarian Cancer Guidelines and the SGO guidelines help physicians evaluate adnexal masses for malignancy. These guidelines take into account menopausal status, CA125 levels, and physical and imaging findings. However, these guidelines have notable shortcomings because of their reliance on diagnostics with certain weaknesses. Most notably, the CA125 blood test, which is cleared by the FDA only for monitoring for recurrence of ovarian cancer, is negative in up to 50% of early stage ovarian cancer cases. Moreover, CA125 can be elevated in numerous conditions and diseases other than ovarian cancer, including benign ovarian masses and endometriosis. These shortcomings limit the CA125 blood test’s utility in distinguishing benign from malignant ovarian tumors or for use in detection of early stage ovarian cancer. Transvaginal ultrasound is another diagnostic modality used with patients with ovarian masses. Attempts at defining specific morphological criteria that can aid in a benign versus malignant diagnosis have led to the morphology index and the risk of malignancy index, with reports of 40-70% predictive value. However, ultrasound interpretation can be variable and dependent on the experience of the operator. Accordingly, the ACOG and SGO guidelines perform only modestly in identifying early stage ovarian cancer and malignancy in pre-menopausal women. Efforts to improve detection of 

 
7

 
cancer by lowering the cutoff for CA125 (the “Modified ACOG/SGO Guidelines”) provide only a modest benefit, since CA125 is absent in about 20% of epithelial ovarian cancer cases and is poorly detected in early stage ovarian cancer overall.

 Commercialization
 Starting in 2014, we offered OVA1 via ASPiRA LABS.  In March 2015, we entered into a commercial agreement with Quest Diagnostics.  Pursuant to this agreement, all OVA1 U.S. testing services for Quest Diagnostics customers were transferred to Vermillion’s wholly-owned subsidiary, ASPiRA LABS.  Pursuant to this agreement as amended as of March 1, 2018, Quest Diagnostics has continued to provide blood draw and logistics support by transporting specimens to ASPiRA LABS for testing in exchange for a market value fee.  Per the terms of the agreement, we may not offer to existing or future Quest Diagnostics customers CA 125II or other tests that Quest Diagnostics offers. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are in the process of renewing this agreement. Customers
 In the United States, the IVD market can be segmented into three major groups: clinical reference laboratories, the largest of which are Quest Diagnostics and Laboratory Corporation of America, hospital laboratories, and physician offices.  In 2015, our revenue was generated through Quest Diagnostics and ASPiRA LABS and, since 2016, solely through ASPiRA LABS and ASPiRA IVD.  Both within and outside the United States, laboratories may become customers, either directly with us or via distribution relationships established between us and authorized distributors.  Research and Development
 Our research and development efforts center on the discovery and validation of biomarkers and combinations of biomarkers that can be developed into diagnostic assays. We have done this predominantly through collaborations we have established with academic institutions such as JHU and M.D. Anderson as well as through contract research organizations such as PrecisionMed, Inc. In addition, we actively seek collaborations and initiate dialog with clinical academics, in order to generate publications, intellectual property or test development in broader areas of gynecologic oncology and other gynecologic diseases. Commercial Operations
 We have a commercial infrastructure, including sales and marketing and reimbursement expertise. We also operate a national CLIA certified clinical laboratory, ASPiRA LABS. Our sales representatives work to identify opportunities for educating general gynecologists and gynecologic oncologists on the benefits of OVA1. In February 2015, Vermillion received ISO 13485:2003 certification for our quality management system from the British Standards Institution (BSI), one of the world's leading certification bodies. In March 2015, we announced that OVA1 was CE marked, a requirement for marketing the test in the European Union. In October 2015, we announced registration of the CE mark for and clearance to market Overa in the European Union. We are targeting markets outside of the United States now that we have Overa cleared on the Roche cobas platform, which is available globally. In 2016, we signed our first contracts with distributors outside the United States so that we could begin marketing Overa and OVA1 outside the United States in 2017. 
 Approximately 7,679 OVA1 tests were performed in 2018 compared to 8,575 in 2017, with the decrease being attributed to the loss of a large reference laboratory account in July 2017, partially offset by new contracts. In 2018, we continued to develop the market through experienced market development specialists and customer account managers and hired new Regional Account Managers.  As market awareness continues to build, these managers are focused on efforts that will have a positive impact on regional payers and create positive coverage decisions.  They are working with local key opinion leaders and meeting with medical directors to discuss the clinical need, our technology assessment package and increasing experience and cases studies showing the positive outcomes utilizing OVA1.  
 There are still obstacles to overcome and significant milestones ahead.  First, the average gynecologist will only see about 2 to 4 patients per month who may need our test, and additional effort will be required to establish a consistent ordering pattern.  Second, despite gains in positive medical policy coverage and contract agreements, insurance coverage and patient bills remain a concern to the physician and can disrupt the ordering pattern of a generalist who is supportive of OVA1. We have instituted a “Patient Advocacy Program” to assist with this process to proactively assess insurance and educate patients on testing costs prior to testing being performed.

Reimbursement
 In the United States, revenue for diagnostic tests comes from several sources, including third-party payers such as insurance companies, government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, client bill accounts and patients. Novitas Solutions, a Medicare contractor, covers and reimburses for OVA1 tests performed in certain states, including Texas. Because OVA1 tests are exclusively performed at ASPiRA LABS in Texas, this local coverage determination from Novitas Solutions essentially provides national coverage for patients enrolled in Medicare as well as Medicare Advantage health plans. ASPiRA LABS also bills third-party commercial and other government payers as well as client bill accounts and patients for OVA1.
 In December 2013, the CMS made its final determination and authorized Medicare contractors to set prices for Multianalyte Assays with Algorithmic Analyses (“MAAA”) test CPT codes when they determine it is payable.  In late 2016, OVA1 was included on the list of clinical diagnostic laboratory test procedure codes as one for which the CMS would require reporting of private payer rates as part of the implementation of Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (“PAMA”). In November 2017, we announced that the CMS released the Final 2018 Clinical Lab Fee Schedule (“CLFS”), effective January 1, 2018. Under the new fee schedule, the price for OVA1(MIA) (code 81503) is $897. This is a four-fold increase over the previous CMS rate, and this new rate was based on the median of private payer payments submitted to CMS by companies, including ASPiRA Labs, as part of the market-based payment reform mandated through PAMA. The rate is scheduled to be in effect for a three-year term from January 2018 through December 2020.
 CMS also published a final price for Overa of $950, which was benchmarked to the only proteomic test currently on the CLFS that uses biomarkers and an algorithm to produce a prognostic score. The rate is scheduled to be in effect for a three-year term from January 2018 through December 2020.    Starting in 2016, we were able to make progress in achieving positive medical policy and/or payer contracts. We have continued to make progress with increased payer positive medical polices for an estimated total of over 151 million covered lives as of December 31, 2018. This represents an increase from an estimated 125 million covered lives as of March 1, 2018.
 Competition
 The diagnostics industry in which we operate is competitive and evolving. There is intense competition among healthcare, biotechnology and diagnostics companies attempting to discover candidates for potential new diagnostic products. These companies may: 
· | develop new diagnostic products in advance of us or our collaborators;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | develop diagnostic products that are more effective or cost-effective than those developed by us or our collaborators;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | obtain regulatory clearance or approval of their diagnostic products more rapidly than us or our collaborators; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that would limit our or our collaborators’ ability to develop and commercialize, or a customers’ ability to use our or our collaborators’ diagnostic products.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We compete with companies in the United States and abroad that are engaged in the development and commercialization of novel biomarkers that may form the basis of novel diagnostic tests. These companies may develop products that are competitive with and/or perform the same or similar functions as the products offered by us or our collaborators, such as biomarker specific reagents or diagnostic test kits. Also, clinical laboratories may offer testing services that are competitive with the products sold by us or our collaborators. For example, a clinical laboratory can either use reagents purchased from manufacturers other than us or use its own internally developed reagents to make diagnostic tests. If clinical laboratories make tests in this manner for a particular disease, they could offer testing services for that disease as an alternative to products sold by us used to test for the same disease. The testing services offered by clinical laboratories may be easier to develop and market than test kits developed by us or our collaborators because the testing services are not subject to the same clinical validation requirements that are applicable to FDA-cleared or approved diagnostic test kits.
 Fujirebio Diagnostics sells Risk of Ovarian Malignancy Algorithm (“ROMA”). ROMA combines two tumor markers and menopausal status into a numerical score using a publicly available algorithm.  This test has the same intended use and precautions as OVA1.  ROMA is currently marketed as having utility limited to epithelial ovarian cancers, which accounts for 80% of ovarian malignancies. Based upon the results of a 2013 study, we believe that OVA1 has superior performance when compared to the Fujirebio Diagnostics test.

In addition, competitors such as Becton Dickinson and Abbott Laboratories have publicly disclosed that they have been or are currently working on ovarian cancer diagnostic assays. Academic institutions periodically report new findings in ovarian cancer diagnostics that may have commercial value. 
 Intellectual Property Protection
 Our intellectual property includes the federally registered trademarks for Vermillion, OVA1, Overa and OvaCalc and a portfolio of owned, co-owned or licensed patents and patent applications. As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 

 
9

 
10-K, our clinical diagnostics patent portfolio included 21 issued United States patents, 7 pending United States patent applications, and numerous pending patent applications and issued patents outside the United States. These patents and patent applications fall into 24 patent families and are directed to diagnostic technologies.

Our research collaboration agreement with JHU expired in March 2016.  There were no collaboration expenses under the JHU collaboration agreement for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 under the collaboration agreement. Under the terms of our amended license agreement with JHU dated September 19, 2016, we are required to pay the greater of 4% royalties on net sales of diagnostic tests using the assigned patents or annual minimum royalties of $57,500. 
 Manufacturing
 We are the manufacturer of OVA1 and Overa. Components of OVA1 and Overa include purchased reagents for each of the component assays as well as the OvaCalc® software. Because we do not directly manufacture the component assays, we are required to maintain supply agreements with manufacturers of each of the assays. As part of our quality systems, reagent lots for these assays are tested to ensure they meet specifications required for inclusion in OVA1 and Overa. Only reagent lots determined by us as having met these specifications are permitted for use in OVA1 and Overa. Our principal suppliers are Roche Diagnostics Corporation and Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Inc. Environmental Matters
 Medical Waste
 We are subject to licensing and regulation under federal, state and local laws relating to the handling and disposal of medical specimens and hazardous waste as well as to the safety and health of laboratory employees. ASPiRA LABS and ASPiRA IVD are operated in material compliance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to disposal of all laboratory specimens. We utilize outside vendors for disposal of specimens. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials. We could be subject to fines, penalties and damages claims in the event of an improper or unauthorized release of, or exposure of individuals to, hazardous materials. In addition, claimants may sue us for injury or contamination that results from our use, or the use by third parties, of these materials, and our liability may exceed our total assets. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Occupational Safety
 In addition to its comprehensive regulation of safety in the workplace, the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for healthcare employers whose workers may be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and the hepatitis virus. These regulations, among other things, require work practice controls, protective clothing and equipment, training, medical follow-up, vaccinations and other measures designed to minimize exposure to chemicals and transmission of the blood-borne and airborne pathogens. Although we believe that we have complied in all material respects with such federal, state and local laws, failure to comply could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and other enforcement actions. Specimen Transportation
 Regulations of the Department of Transportation, the International Air Transportation Agency, the Public Health Service and the Postal Service apply to the surface and air transportation of clinical laboratory specimens.  Although we believe that we have complied in all material respects with such federal, state and local laws, failure to comply could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and other enforcement actions. Government Regulation
 General. Our activities related to diagnostic products are, or have the potential to be, subject to regulatory oversight by the FDA under provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations thereunder, including regulations governing the development, marketing, labeling, promotion, manufacturing and export of our products. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act requires that medical devices introduced to the United States market, unless exempted by regulation, be the subject of either a pre-market notification clearance, known as a 510(k) clearance or 510(k) de novo clearance, or a pre-market approval (“PMA”). OVA1 was cleared by the FDA in September 2009 under the 510(k) de novo guidelines.  OVA1 was the first FDA-cleared blood test for the pre-operative assessment of ovarian masses. We received 510(k) clearance for Overa, our second-generation biomarker panel in March 2016.    Even in the case of devices like analyte specific reagents (“ASRs”), which may be exempt from 510(k) clearance or PMA approval requirements, the FDA may impose restrictions on marketing. Our potential future ASR products may be sold only to clinical laboratories certified under CLIA to perform high complexity testing. In addition to requiring approval or clearance for new products, the FDA may require approval or clearance prior to marketing products that are modifications of existing products or the intended uses of these products. Additionally, the FDA will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection for PMA devices. Our suppliers’   
 
10

 
manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic and unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with Quality System Regulations (“QSRs”). Although we believe that we and our suppliers will be able to operate in compliance with the FDA’s QSRs for ASRs, we cannot ensure that we or our suppliers will be in or be able to maintain compliance in the future. We passed an FDA inspection in 2016.  However, we cannot ensure that we will pass any future inspection, if and when it occurs. If the FDA believes that we or our suppliers are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, the FDA can issue a Form 483 List of Observations or warning letter, detain or seize our products, issue a recall notice, enjoin future violations and assess civil and criminal penalties against us. In addition, approvals or clearances could be withdrawn under certain circumstances.
  ASPiRA LABS and any customers using our products for clinical use in the United States may be regulated under CLIA, which is intended to ensure the quality and reliability of clinical laboratories in the United States by mandating specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications, administration, participation in proficiency testing, patient test management, quality control, quality assurance and inspections. The regulations promulgated under CLIA establish three levels of diagnostic tests - namely, waived, moderately complex and highly complex - and the standards applicable to a clinical laboratory depend on the level of the tests it performs. 
 FDA Regulation of Cleared Tests.  Once granted, a 510(k) clearance or PMA approval may place substantial restrictions on how our device is marketed or to whom it may be sold. All devices cleared by the FDA are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state agencies. As a medical device manufacturer, we are also required to register and list our products with the FDA. We are required to set forth and adhere to a quality policy and other regulations. In addition, we are required to comply with the FDA’s QSRs, which require that our devices be manufactured and records be maintained in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing, testing and control activities. Additionally, we may be subject to inspection by federal and state regulatory agencies. Non-compliance with these standards can result in, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls, and total or partial suspension of production. Further, we are required to comply with FDA requirements for labeling and promotion. For example, the FDA prohibits cleared or approved devices from being promoted for uncleared or unapproved uses. Labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA, which prohibits the marketing of medical devices for unapproved uses. Additionally, the FDA requires us to perform certain post-marketing studies to verify or validate the clinical performance of FDA-cleared tests, as is permitted by their statutory authority. Failure to comply with our post-marketing study requirements may lead to enforcement actions by the FDA, including seizure of our product, injunction, prosecution and/or civil money penalties.
 In addition, the medical device reporting regulation requires that we provide information to the FDA whenever evidence reasonably suggests that one of our devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or where a malfunction has occurred that would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur.
 Foreign Government Regulation of Our Products. We intend to obtain regulatory approval in other countries to market our tests. Medical device laws and regulations are in effect in many of the countries in which we may do business outside the United States. These range from comprehensive device approval requirements for some or all of our potential future medical device products, to requests for product data or certifications. The number and scope of these requirements are increasing. In addition, products which have not yet been cleared or approved for domestic commercial distribution may be subject to the FDA Export Reform and Enhancement Act of 1996. Each country also maintains its own regulatory review process, tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements, product standards, and labeling requirements. In February 2015, Vermillion also received ISO 13485:2003 certification for our quality management system from the British Standards Institution (BSI), one of the world's leading certification bodies. In March 2015, OVA1 was CE marked, a requirement for marketing the test in the European Union. In October 2015, we announced registration of the CE mark for and clearance to market Overa in the European Union.
