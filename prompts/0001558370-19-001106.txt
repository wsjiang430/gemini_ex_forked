 Item 1.  Business
 Overview
 Home to the best-selling brands in the industry, Douglas Dynamics, Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our”) is North America's premier manufacturer and upfitter of commercial work truck attachments and equipment. For more than 70 years, the Company has been innovating products that enable end-users to perform their jobs more efficiently and effectively, providing opportunities for businesses to increase profitability. Our commitment to continuous improvement enables us to consistently produce high quality products and drive shareholder value. The Douglas Dynamics portfolio of products and services is separated into two segments:  First, the Work Truck Attachments segment, which includes manufactured snow and ice control attachments sold under the FISHER®, HENDERSON®, SNOWEX® and WESTERN® brands. Second, the Work Truck Solutions segment, which includes the upfit of market leading attachments and storage solutions for commercial work vehicles under the DEJANA® brand and its related sub-brands. The Work Truck Solutions segment was established as a result of the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Dejana Truck & Utility Equipment Company, Inc. and certain entities directly or indirectly owned by Peter Paul Dejana Family Trust Dated 12/31/98 (such assets, “Dejana”) in July 2016.  For additional financial information regarding our reportable business segments, see Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this report.
 In our Work Truck Attachments segment, we offer a broad product line of snowplows and sand and salt spreaders for light and heavy duty trucks that we believe to be the most complete line offered in the U.S. and Canadian markets. We also provide a full range of related parts and accessories, which generates an ancillary revenue stream throughout the lifecycle of our snow and ice control equipment. We also provide customized turnkey solutions to governmental agencies such as Departments of Transportation (“DOTs”) and municipalities.  For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, 84%, 86% and 88% of our net sales in our Work Truck Attachments segment were generated from sales of snow and ice control equipment, respectively, and 16%, 14% and 12% of our net sales in our Work Truck Attachments segment were generated from sales of parts and accessories, respectively. While we measure sales of parts and accessories separately from snow and ice control equipment, they are integrated with one another and are not separable. 
 We sell our Work Truck Attachments products through a distributor network primarily to professional snowplowers who are contracted to remove snow and ice from commercial, municipal and residential areas. We have engendered exceptional customer loyalty for our products because of our ability to satisfy the stringent demands of our customers for a high degree of quality, reliability and service. As a result, we believe our installed base is the largest in the light truck market with over 500,000 snowplows and sand and salt spreaders in service. Because sales of snowplows and sand and salt spreaders are primarily driven by the need of our core end‑user base to replace worn existing equipment, we believe our substantial installed base provides us with a high degree of predictable sales over any extended period of time.
 We believe that our Work Truck Attachments segment has the snow and ice control industry’s most extensive distribution network worldwide, which consists of over 2,100 points of sale. Direct points of shipment are predominantly through North American truck equipment and lawn care equipment distributors. Most of our distributors are located throughout the snow belt regions in North America (primarily the Midwest, East and Northeast regions of the United States as well as all provinces of Canada). We have longstanding relationships with many of our distributors. We continually seek to grow and optimize our network by opportunistically adding high‑quality, well‑capitalized distributors in select geographic areas and by cross‑selling our industry leading brands within our distribution network.  Since 2005, we have extended our reach to international markets, establishing distribution relationships in Northern Europe and Asia, where we believe meaningful growth opportunities exist.
 Created as a result of our acquisition of Dejana, our Work Truck Solutions segment offers a complementary line of upfitting services and products. Our Work Truck Solutions products consist of truck and vehicle upfits where we attach component pieces of equipment, truck bodies, racking, and storage solutions with varying levels of complexity to a vehicle chassis, and which are typically used by end-users for work related purposes. Our Work Truck Solutions segment is a premier upfitter of Class 4 - 6 trucks and other commercial work vehicles. Additionally, we believe that our Work Truck Solutions segment is a leading specialized manufacturer of storage solutions for trucks and vans and cable pulling equipment for trucks. We believe we are a regional market leader in the truck and vehicle

upfitting market.  We believe that our Work Truck Solutions business possesses significant customer relationships comprised of over 2,000 customers across the truck equipment industry. We have longstanding relationships with many of our Work Truck Solutions customers. We continually seek to grow and strengthen our customer relationships by providing custom solutions to our customers’ evolving specialty upfit needs.  We are able to serve our Work Truck Solutions customers’ needs through our bailment and floor plan agreements with original equipment vehicle manufacturers who supply truck chassis, on which we perform custom upfits for our customers.  
 We believe we are the industry’s most operationally efficient manufacturer due to our vertical integration, highly variable cost structure and intense focus on lean manufacturing. We continually seek to use lean principles to reduce costs and increase the efficiency of our manufacturing operations.  During the year ended December 31, 2018 we manufactured our products and upfitted vehicles in five facilities that we own in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Rockland, Maine; Madison Heights, Michigan, Manchester, Iowa; and Huntley, Illinois. We also lease fifteen manufacturing and upfit facilities, located in Iowa, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.  Furthermore, our manufacturing efficiency allows us to deliver desired products quickly to our customers, especially during times of sudden and unpredictable snowfall events when our customers need our products immediately.  
 Our Industry
 Work Truck Attachments Segment.
 Our Work Truck Attachments Segment participates primarily in the snow and ice control equipment industries in North America.  These industries consist predominantly of domestic participants that manufacture their products in North America. The annual demand for snow and ice control equipment is driven primarily by the replacement cycle of the existing installed base, which is predominantly a function of the average life of a snowplow or spreader and is driven by usage and maintenance practices of the end‑user. We believe actively‑used snowplows are typically replaced, on average, every 9 to 12 years.   
 We believe that both light and heavy duty snow and ice control equipment are driven primarily by the replacement cycle of the existing installed base, which is predominantly a function of the average life of a snowplow or spreader and is driven by usage and maintenance practices of the end‑user.   However, we believe that demand for heavy duty trucks is less elastic than light trucks. Heavy duty truck end-users typically are comprised of local governments and municipalities which plan for and execute planned replacement of equipment over time.
 The primary factor influencing the replacement cycle for snow and ice control equipment for light trucks is the level, timing and location of snowfall. Sales of snow and ice control equipment in any given year and region are most heavily influenced by local snowfall levels in the prior snow season. Heavy snowfall during a given winter causes equipment usage to increase, resulting in greater wear and tear and shortened life cycles, thereby creating a need for replacement equipment and additional parts and accessories.
 While snowfall levels vary within a given year and from year‑to‑year, snowfall, and the corresponding replacement cycle of snow and ice control equipment, is relatively consistent over multi‑year periods. The following chart depicts aggregate annual and ten‑year (based on the typical life of our snowplows) rolling average of the aggregate snowfall levels in 66 cities in 26 snow belt states across the Northeast, East, Midwest and Western United States where we monitor snowfall levels from 1980 to 2018. As the chart indicates, since 1984 aggregate snowfall levels in any given rolling ten‑year period have been fairly consistent, ranging from 2,782 to 3,345 inches.

 The demand for snow and ice control equipment can also be influenced by general economic conditions in the United States, as well as local economic conditions in the snow‑belt regions in North America. In stronger economic conditions, our end‑users may choose to replace or upgrade existing equipment before its useful life has ended, while in weak economic conditions, our end‑users may seek to extend the useful life of equipment, thereby increasing the sales of parts and accessories. However, since snow and ice control management is a non‑discretionary service necessary to ensure public safety and continued personal and commercial mobility in populated areas that receive snowfall, end‑users cannot extend the useful life of snow and ice control equipment indefinitely and must replace equipment that has become too worn, unsafe or unreliable, regardless of economic conditions. While our parts and accessories yield slightly higher gross margins than our snow and ice control equipment, they yield significantly lower revenue than equipment sales, which adversely affects our results of operations. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Seasonality and Year‑to‑Year Variability.” 
 Long‑term growth in the overall snow and ice control equipment market also results from geographic expansion of developed areas in the snow belt regions of North America (primarily the Midwest, East and Northeast regions of the United States as well as all provinces of Canada), as well as consumer demand for technological enhancements in snow and ice control equipment and related parts and accessories that improves efficiency and reliability. Continued construction in the snow belt regions in North America increases the aggregate area requiring snow and ice removal, thereby growing the market for snow and ice control equipment. In addition, the development and sale of more reliable, more efficient and more sophisticated products have contributed to an approximate 2% to 4% average unit price increase in each of the past five years.

 Work Truck Solutions Segment.
 Our Work Truck Solutions Segment primarily participates in the truck and vehicle upfitting industry in the United States.  This industry consists predominantly of domestic participants that upfit work trucks and vehicles. Specifically, there are regional market leaders that operate in close proximity to the original equipment vehicle manufacturers’ facilities and vehicle ports of entry. In addition to the regional market leaders, there exist smaller upfit businesses.  Our Work Truck Solutions segment competes against both the other regional market leaders and the smaller market participants.  The annual demand for upfit vehicles is subject to the general macro-economic environment trends.  
 We believe our Work Truck Solutions segment is a regional market leader in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States.  We serve a variety of different customers that include dealers who typically sell to end-users and to large national customers who purchase fleets of upfitted vehicles. Approximately half of our revenues are derived from dealer customers, while approximately 40% of our revenues are fleet sales.  Our remaining sales are derived from over the counter sales of parts and accessories. 
 Long term growth in the truck and vehicle upfit market will depend on technological advances in the component products and advances in the original equipment manufacturer’s vehicles, as well customer demand for such products. Along with technological advancements, end-users are demanding more specialized vehicles specifically related to their unique work related needs, which we expect will further increase demand.  Along with technological advancements, products become more complex in the marketplace, thus increasing the importance of the role of the truck upfitter in the value chain.
 Our Competitive Strengths
 We compete solely with other North American manufacturers and upfitters who do not benefit from our manufacturing efficiencies, depth and breadth of products, extensive distributor network and customer relationships. As the market leader in the industries we serve, we enjoy a set of competitive advantages versus smaller competitors, which allows us to generate robust cash flows in all market environments and to support continued investment in our products, distribution capabilities and brand regardless of annual volume fluctuations. We believe these advantages are rooted in the following competitive strengths and reinforces our industry leadership over time.
 Exceptional Customer Loyalty and Brand Equity. Our brands enjoy exceptional customer loyalty and brand equity in the snow and ice control equipment and truck upfitting industries with both end‑users and distributors, which have been developed through over 70 years of superior innovation, productivity, reliability and support, consistently delivered year after year. We believe past brand experience, rather than price, is the key factor impacting our brands.
 Broadest and Most Innovative Product Offering in Work Truck Attachments. In our Work Truck Attachments segment, we provide the industry’s broadest product offering with a full range of snowplows, sand and salt spreaders and related parts and accessories. We believe we maintain the industry’s largest and most advanced in‑house new product development program, historically introducing several new and redesigned products each year. Our broad product offering and commitment to new product development is essential to maintaining and growing our leading market share position as well as continuing to increase the profitability of our business. Meanwhile at our Work Truck Solutions segment, each upfit is customized to the specific needs of our customers.
 Extensive North American Distributor Network in Work Truck Attachments. With over 2,100 points of sale at our Work Truck Attachments segment, we benefit from having what we believe to be the most extensive distributor network in the light truck and heavy duty snow and ice control equipment industry, providing a significant competitive advantage over our peers. Our distributors function not only as sales and support agents (providing access to parts and service), but also as industry partners providing real‑time end‑user information, such as retail inventory levels, changing consumer preferences or desired functionality enhancements, which we use as the basis for our product development efforts.
 Leader in Operational Efficiency. We believe we are a leader in operational efficiency in our industries, resulting from our application of lean manufacturing principles and a highly variable cost structure. By utilizing lean principles, we are able to adjust production levels easily to meet fluctuating demand, while controlling costs in slower periods. This operational efficiency is supplemented by our highly variable cost structure, driven in part by our access

to a sizable temporary workforce (comprising approximately 10‑15% of our total workforce during average snowfall years), which we can quickly adjust, as needed. These manufacturing efficiencies enable us to respond rapidly to urgent customer demand during times of sudden and unpredictable snowfalls, allowing us to provide exceptional service to our existing customer base and capture new customers from competitors that we believe cannot service their customers’ needs with the same speed and reliability.
 Strong Cash Flow Generation. We are able to generate significant cash flow as a result of relatively consistent high profitability, low capital spending requirements and predictable timing of our working capital requirements. Our significant cash flow has allowed us to reinvest in our business, pay down long term debt, and pay substantial dividends to our stockholders.
 Experienced Management Team. We believe our business benefits from an exceptional management team that is responsible for establishing our leadership in the light truck and heavy duty snow and ice control equipment and truck upfitting industries. Our senior management team, consisting of six officers as of December 31, 2018, has an average of approximately eighteen years of weather‑related industry experience and an average of over ten years with our company. James Janik, our Executive Chairman, has been with us for over 25 years and served as President and Chief Executive Officer from 2000 to 2018, and through his strategic vision, we have been able to expand our distributor network and grow our market leading position. On January 1, 2019, Robert McCormick became our President and Chief Executive Officer. He has been with us for over 14 years and has served in various roles, including Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, among others. 
 Our Business Strategy
 Our business strategy is to capitalize on our competitive strengths to maximize cash flow to pay dividends, reduce indebtedness and reinvest in our business to create stockholder value. We have also developed a management system called the Douglas Dynamics Management System (“DDMS”) that is intended to assist in value creation and enhanced customer service. The building blocks of our strategy are:
 Continuous Product Innovation. We believe new product innovation is critical to maintaining and growing our market leading position in the snow and ice control equipment industry. We will continue to focus on developing innovative solutions to increase productivity, ease of use, reliability, durability and serviceability of our products and on incorporating lean manufacturing concepts into our product development process, which has allowed us to reduce the overall cost of development and, more importantly, to reduce our time‑to‑market by nearly one‑half.
 Distributor Network and Customer Optimization. At our Work Truck Attachment segment, we will continually seek opportunities to continue to expand our extensive distribution network by adding high‑quality, well‑capitalized distributors in select geographic areas and by cross‑selling our industry leading brands within our distribution network to ensure we maximize our ability to generate revenue while protecting our industry leading reputation, customer loyalty and brands. We will also focus on optimizing this network by providing in‑depth training, valuable distributor support and attractive promotional and incentive opportunities. As a result of these efforts, we believe a majority of our distributors choose to sell our products exclusively. We believe this sizable high quality network is unique in the industry, providing us with valuable insight into purchasing trends and customer preferences, and would be very difficult to replicate. At our Work Truck Solutions segment, we have well developed customer relationships resulting from being responsive to the needs of our customers.  We will seek opportunities to continue to expand our customer group by increasing throughput allowing us to grow our customer base and continue to be responsive to our customers’ specialized upfit needs. 
 Aggressive Asset Management and Profit Focus. We will continue to aggressively manage our assets in order to maximize our cash flow generation despite seasonal and annual variability in snowfall levels that affect our Work Truck Attachments segment. We believe our ability is unique in our industry and enables us to achieve attractive margins in all snowfall environments. Key elements of our asset management and profit focus strategies include:

· | employment of a highly variable cost structure, which can allow us to quickly adjust costs in response to real‑time changes in demand;

· | use of enterprise‑wide lean principles, which allow us to easily adjust production levels up or down to meet demand;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | implementation of a pre‑season order program, which incentivizes distributors to place orders prior to the retail selling season and thereby enables us to more efficiently utilize our assets; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | development of a vertically integrated business model, which we believe provides us cost advantages over our competition.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Additionally, although modest, our capital expenditure requirements and operating expenses can be temporarily reduced in response to anticipated or actual lower sales in a particular year to maximize cash flow.
 Flexible, Lean Enterprise Platform. We will continue to utilize lean principles to maximize the flexibility, efficiency and productivity of our manufacturing operations while reducing the associated costs, enabling us to increase distributor and end‑user satisfaction. For example, in an environment where shorter lead times and near‑perfect order fulfillment are important to our distributors, we believe our lean processes have helped us to improve our shipping performance and build a reputation for providing industry leading shipping performance.
 Our Growth Opportunities
 Opportunistically Seek New Products and New Markets. On July 15, 2016, we completed our acquisition of Dejana, which we believe significantly strengthens our position as a premier manufacturer and upfitter of vehicle attachments and equipment. Adding the Dejana business has diversified our revenue streams and reduced the influence of weather on the overall business going forward. On December 31, 2014, we completed our acquisition of Henderson, which gave us Henderson’s full line of product offerings and access to its network of dealers.  We plan to continue to evaluate other acquisition opportunities within our industry that can help us expand our distribution reach, enhance our technology and as a consequence improve the breadth and depth of our product lines. We also consider diversification opportunities in adjacent markets that complement our business model and could offer us the ability to leverage our core competencies to create stockholder value.
 Increase Our Industry Leading Market Share. In our Work Truck Attachments segment, we plan to leverage our industry leading position, distribution network and new product innovation capabilities to capture market share in the North American snow and ice control equipment market, focusing our primary efforts on increasing penetration in those North American markets where we believe our overall market share is less than 50%, including the heavy duty truck market. We also plan to continue growing our presence in the snow and ice control equipment market outside of North America, particularly in Asia and Europe, which we believe could provide significant growth opportunities in the future.  At our Work Truck Solutions segment, we plan to leverage our regional market leading position and utilize DDMS to further penetrate upfit markets and to grow our customer base.
 Order Backlog

We had total backlog of $122.6 million and $81.3 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Backlog information may not be indicative of results of operations for future periods.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we employed 1,663 employees on a full‑time basis.  None of our employees are represented by a union and we are not party to any collective bargaining agreements. Financing Program
 We are party to a financing program in which certain distributors may elect to finance their purchases from us through a third party financing company. We provide the third party financing company recourse against us regarding the collectability of the receivable under the program due to the fact that if the third party financing company is unable to collect from the distributor the amounts due in respect of the product financed, we would be obligated to 

 
  8

 
repurchase any remaining inventory related to the product financed and reimburse any legal fees incurred by the financing company. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, distributors financed purchases of $8.5 million, $7.1 million and $7.6 million through this financing program, respectively. At both December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, there were no uncollectible outstanding receivables related to sales financed under the financing program. The amount owed by our distributors to the third party financing company under this program at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $7.8 million and $3.4 million, respectively. We were not required to repurchase repossessed inventory for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.
 In the past, minimal losses have been incurred under this agreement. However, an adverse change in distributor retail sales could cause this situation to change and thereby require us to repurchase repossessed units. Any repossessed units are inspected to ensure they are current, unused product and are restocked and resold.
 Intellectual Property
 We maintain patents relating to snowplow mounts, assemblies, hydraulics, electronics and lighting systems, brooms, sand, salt and fertilizer spreader assemblies, reel handlers and carriers and shelving systems. Patents are valid for the longer period of 17 years from issue date or 20 years from filing date. The duration of the patents we currently possess range between less than one year and 19 years of remaining life. Our patent applications date from 1999 through 2018.
 We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets and trademarks to protect certain of the proprietary aspects of our business and technology. We hold approximately 48 U.S. registered trademarks (including the trademarks WESTERN®, FISHER®, DEJANA®, BLIZZARD®, SNOWEX®, TURFEX®, SWEEPEX®, HENDERSON® and BRINEXTREME®) 12 Canadian registered trademarks, 5 European trademarks, 70 U.S. issued patents, 10 Canadian patents and 5 Chinese and 2 Mexican trademarks.
 We rely upon a combination of patents, trade secrets and trademarks to protect certain of the proprietary aspects of our business and technology. In the year ended December 31, 2017, we received a settlement resulting from an ongoing lawsuit with one of our competitors that had been previously ordered to stop using our intellectual property. Under the settlement agreement we received $1.3 million as part of defending our intellectual property. In the year ended December 31, 2016, we received a settlement resulting from an ongoing lawsuit with another competitor relating to our intellectual property. Under the settlement agreement we received $10.1 million as part of defending our intellectual property.   Our competitor has exhausted all appeals related to this matter and has paid us both awarded damages of $10.0 million and accrued interest of $0.1 million. 
 Raw Materials
 During 2018, we experienced less favorable commodity costs compared to the prices paid for commodities in 2017 due to tariffs causing the inflation of steel prices. Historically, we have mitigated, and we currently expect to continue to mitigate, commodity cost increases in part by engaging in proactive vendor negotiations, reviewing alternative sourcing options, substituting materials, engaging in internal cost reduction efforts, and increasing prices on some of our products, all as appropriate.
 Most of the components of our products are also affected by commodity cost pressures and are commercially available from a number of sources. In 2018, we experienced no significant work stoppages because of shortages of raw materials or commodities. The highest raw material and component costs are generally for steel, which we purchase from several suppliers.
