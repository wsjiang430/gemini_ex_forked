Item 1. Business
General
We are a vertically integrated global manufacturer and marketer of basic chemicals, vinyls, polymers and building products. Our products include some of the most widely used chemicals in the world, which are fundamental to many diverse consumer and industrial markets, including flexible and rigid packaging, automotive products, coatings, water treatment, refrigerants, residential and commercial construction as well as other durable and non-durable goods. We operate in two principal operating segments, Olefins and Vinyls. We are highly integrated along our olefins product chain with significant downstream integration into polyethylene and styrene monomer. We are also an integrated global producer of vinyls with substantial downstream integration into polyvinyl chloride ("PVC") building products.
We began operations in 1986 after our first polyethylene plant, an Olefins segment business, near Lake Charles, Louisiana was acquired from Occidental Petroleum Corporation. We began our vinyls operations in 1990 with the acquisition of a vinyl chloride monomer ("VCM") plant in Calvert City, Kentucky from Goodrich Corporation. In 1992, we commenced our Vinyls segment's building products operations after acquiring three PVC pipe plants. Since 1986, we have grown rapidly into an integrated global producer of petrochemicals, vinyls, polymers and building products. We achieved this growth by acquiring existing plants or constructing new plants and completing numerous capacity or production line expansions. We regularly consider acquisitions and other internal and external growth opportunities that would be consistent with, or complementary to, our overall business strategy.
In 2014, we formed Westlake Chemical Partners LP ("Westlake Partners") to operate, acquire and develop ethylene production facilities and related assets. Also in 2014, Westlake Partners completed an initial public offering of 12,937,500 common units (the "Westlake Partners IPO"). On September 29, 2017, Westlake Partners completed a secondary offering of 5,175,000 common units at a price of $22.00 per unit and purchased an additional 5.0% newly-issued limited partner interest in Westlake Chemical OpCo LP ("OpCo") for approximately $229 million resulting in an aggregate 18.3% limited partner interest in OpCo effective July 1, 2017. As of February 13, 2019, Westlake Partners' assets consist of an 18.3% limited partner interest in OpCo, as well as the general partner interest in OpCo. Prior to the Westlake Partners IPO, OpCo's assets were wholly-owned by us. OpCo's assets include two ethylene production facilities at our olefins facility at our Lake Charles site, one ethylene production facility at our Calvert City site and a 200-mile common carrier ethylene pipeline that runs from Mont Belvieu, Texas to the Longview, Texas site, which includes our Longview polyethylene production facility. We retain an 81.7% limited partner interest in OpCo, a 43.8% limited partner interest in Westlake Partners (consisting of 14,122,230 common units), a general partner interest in Westlake Partners and incentive distribution rights. The operations of Westlake Partners are consolidated in our financial statements. We are party to certain agreements with Westlake Partners and OpCo whereby, among other things, OpCo sells us 95% of the ethylene it produces on a cost-plus basis that is expected to generate a fixed margin per pound of $0.10. We use this ethylene in the production processes of both our Olefins and Vinyls segments. For more information, see "—Olefins Business" and "—Vinyls Business" below.
On August 31, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Axiall Corporation ("Axiall") for $33.00 per share in an all-cash transaction (the "Axiall Merger"). Axiall was a manufacturer and international marketer of chemicals and building products, with manufacturing sites in North America. After the Axiall Merger, we are the third-largest global chlor-alkali producer and the third-largest PVC producer in the world.
On January 2, 2019, we completed the acquisition of NAKANTM, a global compounding solutions business. NAKAN's products are used in a wide-variety of applications, including in the automotive, building and construction, and medical industries. With this acquisition, our compounding business now has facilities worldwide in China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Spain, the United States and Vietnam, as well as a world-class research facility in France and several application laboratories. 
We benefit from highly integrated production facilities that allow us to process raw materials into higher value-added chemicals and building products. As of February 13, 2019, we (directly and through OpCo and our 95%- and 60%-owned joint ventures in China and Taiwan, respectively) had approximately 42.1 billion pounds per year of aggregate production capacity at numerous manufacturing sites in North America, Europe and Asia.

Olefins Business
Products
Olefins are the basic building blocks used to create a wide variety of petrochemical products. We manufacture ethylene (through OpCo), polyethylene, styrene and associated co-products at our manufacturing facility in Lake Charles and polyethylene at our Longview facility. We have two ethylene plants, which are owned by OpCo, two polyethylene plants and one styrene monomer plant at our olefins facility at our Lake Charles site. We have three polyethylene plants and a specialty polyethylene wax plant at our Longview site.
The following table illustrates our production capacities at February 13, 2019 by principal product and the primary end uses of these materials:

Product | Annual Capacity | End Uses
 | (Millions of pounds) | 
Ethylene (1) | 2,990 | | Polyethylene, ethylene dichloride ("EDC"), styrene, ethylene oxide/ethylene glycol 
Low-Density Polyethylene ("LDPE") | 1,500 | | High clarity packaging and bags, shrink films, food packaging, coated paper board, cup stock, paper folding cartons, lids, closures and general purpose molding
Linear Low-Density Polyethylene ("LLDPE") | 1,070 | | Heavy-duty films and bags, general purpose liners 
Styrene | 570 | | Consumer disposables, packaging material, appliances, paints and coatings, resins and building materials 

______________________________

(1) | Production capacity owned by OpCo.

Ethylene. Ethylene is the world's most widely used petrochemical in terms of volume. It is the key building block used to produce a large number of higher value-added chemicals including polyethylene, EDC, VCM and styrene. OpCo has the capacity to produce approximately 3.0 billion pounds of ethylene per year at our olefins facility at our Lake Charles site, and we have the capability to consume all of OpCo's production that we purchase at Lake Charles to produce polyethylene and styrene monomer in our Olefins business and to produce VCM and EDC in our Vinyls business. OpCo also produces ethylene for our Vinyls segment at our Calvert City site, and substantially all of the ethylene we purchase from OpCo at Calvert City is used internally in the production of VCM. For OpCo's annual ethylene production that is purchased by us for our Vinyls business, see "Business—Vinyls Business." In addition, we (through OpCo) produce ethylene co-products including chemical grade propylene, crude butadiene, pyrolysis gasoline and hydrogen. We (through OpCo) sell our entire output of these co-products to external customers. OpCo completed an upgrade and capacity expansion of its Petro 1 ethylene unit at our Lake Charles site in 2016 which increased OpCo's ethylene capacity by approximately 250 million pounds annually.
Polyethylene. Polyethylene, the world's most widely consumed polymer, is used in the manufacture of a wide variety of film, coatings and molded product applications primarily used in packaging. Polyethylene is generally classified as either LDPE, LLDPE or high-density polyethylene ("HDPE"). The density correlates to the relative stiffness of the end-use products. The difference between LDPE and LLDPE is molecular, and products produced from LLDPE, in general, have higher strength properties than products produced from LDPE. LDPE exhibits better clarity and other physical properties and is used in end products such as bread bags, dry cleaning bags, food wraps, milk carton coatings and food packaging. LLDPE is used for higher film strength applications such as stretch film and heavy duty sacks. HDPE is used to manufacture products such as grocery, merchandise and trash bags, rigid plastic containers, plastic closures and pipe.
We are the leading producer of LDPE by capacity in North America and predominantly use the autoclave technology (versus tubular technology), which is capable of producing higher margin specialty polyethylene products. In 2018, our annual capacity of approximately 1.5 billion pounds was available in numerous formulations to meet the needs of our diverse customer base. We also have the capacity to produce approximately 1.1 billion pounds of LLDPE per year in various formulations. We produce LDPE and LLDPE at both the Lake Charles and Longview facilities. Our Lake Charles and Longview facilities also have the capability to produce HDPE. We sell polyethylene to external customers as a final product in pellet form.
Styrene. Styrene is used to produce derivatives such as polystyrene, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, unsaturated polyester and synthetic rubber. These derivatives are used in a number of applications including consumer disposables, food packaging, housewares, paints and coatings, building materials, tires and toys. We produce styrene at our Lake Charles plant, where we have the capacity to produce approximately 570 million pounds of styrene per year, all of which is sold to external customers.
2

Feedstocks
We are highly integrated along our olefins product chain. We (through OpCo) produce most of the ethylene required to produce our polyethylene and styrene. Ethylene can be produced from either petroleum liquid feedstocks, such as naphtha, condensates and gas oils, or from natural gas liquid feedstocks, such as ethane, propane and butane. Both of OpCo's Lake Charles ethylene plants use ethane as the primary feedstock. Pursuant to a feedstock supply agreement between us and OpCo, OpCo receives ethane feedstock at the olefins facility at our Lake Charles site through several pipelines from a variety of suppliers in Texas and Louisiana. We own a 50% interest in a 104-mile natural gas liquids pipeline from Mont Belvieu to our Lake Charles site. OpCo owns a 200-mile ethylene pipeline that runs from Mont Belvieu to our Longview site.
In addition to ethylene supplied by OpCo, we also acquire ethylene from third parties in order to supply a portion of our ethylene requirements. We acquire butene and hexene to manufacture polyethylene and benzene to manufacture styrene. We receive butene and hexene at the Lake Charles site and hexene at the Longview site via rail car from several suppliers. We receive benzene via barges, ships and pipeline pursuant to short-term arrangements. We purchase butene and hexene pursuant to multi-year contracts, some of which are renewable for an additional term subject to either party to the contract notifying the other party that it does not wish to renew the contract. We purchase electricity for our Lake Charles facility under long-term industrial contracts.
Marketing, Sales and Distribution
We have an internal sales force that sells our products directly to our customers. Our polyethylene customers are some of the nation's largest producers of film and flexible packaging.
We and OpCo sell ethylene and ethylene co-products to external customers. OpCo's primary ethylene co-products are chemical grade propylene, crude butadiene, pyrolysis gasoline and hydrogen. 
We have storage agreements and exchange agreements that allow us and OpCo access to customers who are not directly connected to the pipeline system that we own. OpCo ships crude butadiene and pyrolysis gasoline by rail or truck. Additionally, we transport our polyethylene and styrene by rail or truck. Further, styrene can be transported by barge or ship.
No single customer accounted for 10% or more of net sales for the Olefins segment in 2018. 
Competition
The markets in which our Olefins business operates are highly competitive. We compete on the basis of customer service, product deliverability, quality, consistency, performance and price. Our competitors in the ethylene, polyethylene and styrene markets are some of the world's largest chemical companies, including Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, DowDuPont Inc., ExxonMobil Chemical Company, Formosa Plastics Corporation, LyondellBasell Industries, N.V. and NOVA Chemicals Corporation.
Vinyls Business
Products
Principal products in our integrated Vinyls segment include PVC, VCM, EDC, chlor-alkali (chlorine and caustic soda) and chlorinated derivative products and, through OpCo, ethylene. We also manufacture and sell PVC compounds and building products fabricated from PVC, including siding, pipe, fittings, profiles, trim, mouldings, fence and decking products, window and door components and film and sheet products. We manage our integrated Vinyls production chain, from the basic chemicals to finished building products, to optimize product margins and capacity utilization. Our primary North American chemical manufacturing facilities are located in our Calvert City, Kentucky and Lake Charles, Plaquemine and Geismar, Louisiana sites. Our Calvert City site includes an ethylene plant, which is owned by OpCo, a chlor-alkali plant, a VCM plant and a PVC plant.

PVC. PVC, the world's third most widely used plastic, is an attractive alternative to traditional materials such as glass, metal, wood, concrete and other plastic materials because of its versatility, durability and cost-competitiveness. PVC is produced from VCM, which is, in turn, made from chlorine and ethylene. PVC compounds are highly customized formulations that offer specific end-use properties based on customer-determined manufacturing specifications. PVC compounds are made by combining PVC resin with various additives in order to make either rigid and impact-resistant or soft and flexible compounds. The various compounds are then fabricated into end-products through extrusion, calendering, injection-molding or blow-molding. 
We are the third-largest PVC producer in the world. We have the capacity to produce approximately 6.0 billion pounds and 1.1 billion pounds of commodity and specialty PVC per year, respectively, at our various facilities globally. We use some of our PVC internally in the production of our building products and PVC compounds. The remainder of our PVC is sold to downstream fabricators and the international markets.
VCM. VCM is used to produce PVC, solvents and PVC-related products. We use ethylene and chlorine to produce VCM. We have the capacity to produce approximately 6.0 billion pounds and 1.5 billion pounds of VCM per year at our North American and European facilities, respectively. The majority of our VCM is used internally in our PVC operations. VCM not used internally is sold to other vinyl resins producers in domestic and international markets.
Chlorine and Caustic Soda. We combine salt and electricity to produce chlorine and caustic soda, commonly referred to as chlor-alkali, at our Lake Charles, Plaquemine, Natrium, Calvert City, Geismar, Beauharnois, Longview, Gendorf, and Knapsack, Germany and Kaohsiung facilities. We are the third-largest chlor-alkali producer in the world. We use our chlorine production in our VCM and chlorinated derivative products plants. We currently have the capacity to supply all of our chlorine requirements internally. Any remaining chlorine is sold into the merchant chlorine market. Our caustic soda is sold to external customers who use it for, among other things, the production of pulp and paper, organic and inorganic chemicals and alumina.
4

Chlorinated Derivative Products. Our chlorinated derivative products include ethyl chloride, perchloroethylene, trichloroethylene, tri-ethane® solvents, VersaTRANS® solvents, calcium hypochlorite, hydrochloric acid ("HCL") and pelletized caustic soda ("PELS"). We have the capacity to produce approximately 2.3 billion pounds of chlorinated derivative products per year, primarily at our Lake Charles, Natrium, Beauharnois and Longview facilities. The majority of our chlorinated derivative products are sold to external customers who use these products for, among other things, refrigerants, water treatment applications, chemicals and pharmaceutical production, food processing, steel pickling, solvent and cleaning chemicals and natural gas and oil production.
Ethylene. We use the ethylene we purchase that is produced by OpCo at Calvert City to produce VCM. OpCo's Calvert City ethylene plant has the capacity to partially supply the ethylene required for our total VCM production. We obtain the remainder of the ethylene we need for our Vinyls business from OpCo's Lake Charles plants and from third party purchases. OpCo's Calvert City ethylene plant utilizes ethane feedstock and enables us, through OpCo, to enhance our vinyl chain integration. In 2017, OpCo completed an expansion project to increase the ethylene capacity of its ethylene plant at our Calvert City facility. The expansion along with other initiatives, increased ethylene capacity by approximately 100 million pounds annually.
Building Products and PVC Compounds. Products made from PVC are used in construction materials ranging from water and sewer systems to home and commercial applications for siding, trim, mouldings, fence, deck, window and door systems. Our building products consist of two primary product groups: (i) exterior products, which includes siding, trim, mouldings, window profiles, fence and decking products; and (ii) PVC pipe, specialty PVC pipe and fittings. We manufacture and market exterior products under the Royal Building Products®, Celect Cellular Exteriors by Royal®, Zuri Premium Decking by Royal®, Royal S4S Trim Board® and Exterior Portfolio® brand names. We manufacture and market specialty pipe and fittings, water, sewer, irrigation and conduit pipe products under the North American Pipe® and Royal Building Products® brand names. We manufacture film and sheet at our Shanghai facility for both Asian and global markets. Flexible PVC compounds are used for wire and cable insulation, medical films and packaging, flooring, wall coverings, automotive interior and exterior trims and packaging. Rigid extrusion PVC compounds are commonly used in window and door profiles, vertical blinds and construction products, including pipe and siding. Injection-molding PVC compounds are used in specialty products such as computer housings and keyboards, appliance parts and bottles. Powder compounds are primarily used in window and door profiles and pipe and fittings. All of our building products and PVC compounds are sold to external customers. The combined capacity of our 36 building products and PVC compounds plants is approximately 3.4 billion pounds per year.
Feedstocks 
We are highly integrated along our vinyls production chain. We produce most of the ethylene required by our Calvert City and Geismar facilities (through OpCo). Ethylene produced at OpCo's Calvert City facility utilizes ethane feedstock. We purchase the remainder of the ethylene required for our other North American and European facilities from a number of sources under various contracts. We are party to a joint venture, LACC, LLC ("LACC"), with Lotte Chemical USA Corporation to build an ethylene facility, that will have 2.2 billion pounds per year of ethylene production capacity. The LACC ethylene facility is located adjacent to our vinyls facility in Lake Charles. Pursuant to an agreement with LACC, we will receive 50% of the ethylene produced at LACC starting from 2019 based on the anticipated start-up of the facility in the first half of 2019. We have access to, and partially own, an ethylene pipeline in Germany. The salt requirements for several of our larger chlor-alkali plants are supplied internally from salt domes we either own or lease and is transported by pipelines we own. We purchase the salt required for our other chlor-alkali plants pursuant to long-term contracts. Electricity and steam for one of our Lake Charles facilities are produced by both on-site cogeneration units and through a toll arrangement with RS Cogen, LLC ("RS Cogen"), a joint venture in which we own a 50% interest. RS Cogen operates a process steam, natural gas-fired cogeneration facility adjacent to the site. Electricity and steam for the Plaquemine facility is supplied internally by our on-site cogeneration unit. A portion of our Natrium facility's electricity requirements is produced by our on-site generation unit, and the remainder is purchased. We purchase electricity for our remaining facilities under long-term contracts. We purchase VCM for our Asian PVC plant on a contract and spot basis. 
Our North American and Asian PVC facilities supply predominantly all of the PVC required for our building products plants. PVC required for the PVC compounds plants is either internally sourced or externally purchased at market prices based on the location of the plants. The remaining feedstocks include pigments, fillers, stabilizers and other ingredients, which we purchase under short-term contracts based on prevailing market prices.
5

Marketing, Sales and Distribution
We have a dedicated sales force for our business, organized by product line and region. In addition, we rely on distributors to market products to smaller customers. We use some of our PVC internally in the production of our building products and PVC compounds. The remainder of our PVC is sold to downstream fabricators and the international markets. We have the capacity to use a majority of our chlorine internally to produce VCM and EDC, most of which, in turn, is used to produce PVC. We also use our chlorine internally to produce chlorinated derivative products. We sell the remainder of our chlorine and substantially all of our caustic soda production to external customers. The majority of our products are shipped from production facilities directly to the customer via pipeline, truck, rail, barge and/or ship. The remaining products are shipped from production facilities to third party chemical terminals and warehouses until being sold to customers.
We are the second largest manufacturer of PVC pipe by capacity in the United States. We sell a majority of our siding, trim and mouldings products, PVC pipe, specialty PVC pipe and fittings, and film and sheet products through a combination of our internal sales force and manufacturer's representatives. In Canada, we operate 19 company-owned distribution branches that sell our vinyl siding and accessories and trim and mouldings products, as well as pipe and fittings. We also engage in advertising programs primarily directed at trade professionals that are intended to develop awareness and interest in our products. In addition, we display our building products at trade shows.
No single customer accounted for 10% or more of net sales for the Vinyls segment in 2018.
Competition
The markets in which our Vinyls business operates are highly competitive. Competition in the vinyls market is based on product availability, product performance, customer service and price. We compete in the vinyls market with other producers including Formosa Plastics Corporation, Oxy Chem, LP, Shintech, Inc., Olin Corporation, PolyOne Corp., Teknor Apex Company, Inc., Mexichem, S.A.B. de C.V., INOVYN ChlorVinyls Limited, VYNOVA Group and Kem One Group SAS.
Competition in the building products market is based on on-time delivery, product quality, product innovation, customer service, product consistency and price. We compete in the building products market with other producers and fabricators including Diamond Plastics Corporation, JM Eagle Inc., Ply Gem Holdings, Inc., CertainTeed Corporation, IPEX Inc., Associated Materials LLC and the Azek Company.
Environmental
As is common in our industry, we are subject to environmental laws and regulations related to the use, storage, handling, generation, transportation, emission, discharge, disposal and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances and wastes in all of the countries in which we do business. National, state or provincial and local standards regulating air, water and land quality affect substantially all of our manufacturing locations around the world. Compliance with such laws and regulations has required and will continue to require capital expenditures and increase operating costs.
It is our policy to comply with all environmental, health and safety requirements and to provide safe and environmentally sound workplaces for our employees. In some cases, compliance can be achieved only by incurring capital expenditures. In 2018, we made capital expenditures of $23 million related to environmental compliance. We estimate that we will make capital expenditures of approximately $47 million in 2019 and $45 million in 2020, respectively, related to environmental compliance. The expected 2019 and 2020 capital expenditures are relatively higher than the amounts we have spent related to environmental compliance in recent years in large part due to capital expenditures related to Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") regulations. The remainder of the 2019 and 2020 estimated expenditures are related to equipment replacement and upgrades. We anticipate that stringent environmental regulations will continue to be imposed on us and the industry in general. Although we cannot predict with certainty future expenditures, management believes that our current spending trends will continue.
From time to time, we receive notices or inquiries from government entities regarding alleged violations of environmental laws and regulations pertaining to, among other things, the disposal, emission and storage of chemical substances, including hazardous wastes. Item 103 of the SEC's Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and the proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions, unless we reasonably believe such sanctions would not exceed $100,000.

• | In May 2013, an amendment to an existing consent order agreed to by the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection and a predecessor of Axiall required that it, among other things, pay a penalty in the amount of $449,000 and continue certain corrective actions associated with discharges of hexachlorocyclohexane (commonly referred to as BHC) from the Natrium facility's effluent discharge outfalls. The penalty was paid and corrective actions required are on-going per a December 2018 agreement to extend the compliance date under the amended consent order. The amended consent order also imposes stipulated penalties for exceedances of the facility's interim effluent discharge limits, which penalties we believe may, in the aggregate, reach or exceed $100,000.


• | During September 2010, our vinyls facilities in Lake Charles and Plaquemine each received a Consolidated Compliance Order and Notice of Potential Penalty, alleging violations of various requirements of those facilities' air permits, based largely on self-reported permit deviations related to record-keeping violations. We have been negotiating a possible global settlement of these and several other matters with the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality ("LDEQ"). In May 2018, we reached an agreement in principal with the LDEQ to resolve these consolidated enforcement matters for a penalty of $162,500. The settlement agreement is being prepared and when finalized will be subject to public comment and approval by the Louisiana Attorney General.


• | For several years, the EPA has been conducting an enforcement initiative against petroleum refineries and petrochemical plants with respect to emissions from flares. On April 21, 2014, we received a Clean Air Act Section 114 Information Request from the EPA which sought information regarding flares at the Calvert City facility and certain Lake Charles facilities. The EPA has informed us that the information provided leads the EPA to believe that some of the flares are out of compliance with applicable standards. The EPA has indicated that it is seeking a consent decree that would obligate us to take corrective actions relating to the alleged noncompliance. We believe the resolution of these matters may require the payment of a monetary sanction in excess of $100,000.


• | Regional offices of the EPA have investigated, and in some cases inspected, our compliance with Risk Management Program requirements under the Clean Air Act at our Natrium and Geismar facilities. We believe the resolution of these matters may require the payment of a monetary sanction in excess of $100,000.


• | On November 24, 2014, we entered into an agreed order with the Kentucky Energy and Environmental Cabinet ("KEEC") regarding our Kentucky Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit limits for hexachlorobenzene and mercury at our Calvert City facility. On July 9, 2018, we and the KEEC entered into a new agreed order under which we will be subject to new interim discharge limits for hexachlorobenzene in addition to accompanying stipulated penalties for exceedances of those interim discharge limits, which penalties we believe may, in the aggregate, reach or exceed $100,000.

We do not believe that the resolution of any or all of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Also see our discussion of our environmental matters contained in Item 1A, "Risk Factors" below, Item 3, "Legal Proceedings" below and Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Employees 
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 8,870 employees in the following areas: 

Category | Number
Olefins segment | 850 
Vinyls segment | 7,680 
Corporate and other | 340 

Approximately 33% of our employees are represented by labor unions, and all of these union employees are working under collective bargaining agreements that expire at various times through 2022. We have multiple collective bargaining agreements in Europe, Canada and the United States, covering different groups of our work force. There were no strikes, lockouts, or work stoppages in 2018 and we believe that our relationship with our employees and unions is open and positive.

Technology 
Historically, our technology strategy has been to selectively acquire licenses from third-parties, as well as develop our own proprietary technology. Our selection process incorporates many factors, including the cost of the technology, the ability to meet our customers' requirements, raw material and energy consumption rates, product quality, capital costs, maintenance requirements and reliability. Most of the technology licensed from third-party providers is perpetual and has been paid in full. We own an intellectual property portfolio developed from focused research in both process and product technology. After acquiring or developing a technology, we devote considerable effort to effectively employ the technology and further its development, with a focus towards continuous improvement of our competitive positions.
Conversely, we have selectively granted licenses to our patented Energx® technology for LLDPE production and for proprietary LDPE reactor mixing technology. We have also granted several licenses for EDC/VCM technology, including the direct chlorination process and catalyst, and S-PVC (Suspension PVC for thermoplastic process) process and technology.
