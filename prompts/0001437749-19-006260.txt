ITEM 1. Business
General
 Patriot National Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”), a Connecticut corporation, is a one-bank holding company for Patriot Bank, N.A, a national banking association headquartered in Stamford, Fairfield County, Connecticut (the “Bank”) (collectively, “Patriot”). The Bank received its charter and commenced operations as a national bank on August 31, 1994. The Bank has a total of nine branch offices comprised of eight branch offices located in Fairfield and New Haven Counties, Connecticut and one branch offices located in Westchester County, New York as of December 31, 2018.
 
On March 11, 2003, the Company formed Patriot National Statutory Trust I (the “Trust”) for the sole purpose of issuing trust preferred securities and investing the proceeds in subordinated debentures issued by the Company. The Company primarily invested the funds from the issuance of the debt in the Bank. The Bank used the proceeds to fund general operations.
 
On October 15, 2010, pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”), the Company issued and sold to PNBK Holdings LLC (“Holdings”), an investment limited liability company controlled by Michael Carrazza, 3.36 million shares of its common stock at a purchase price of $15.00 per share (adjusted for a 1-for-10 reverse stock split discussed below) for an aggregate purchase price of $50.4 million. The shares sold to Holdings represented 87.6% of the Company’s then issued and outstanding common stock. In connection with the reverse stock split, the par value of the common stock was changed to $0.01 per share. Also in connection with the sale of the shares, certain directors and officers of both the Company and the Bank resigned. Such directors and officers were replaced with nominees of Holdings and Michael Carrazza became the Chairman of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of the Company. In January 2018, Holdings transferred 840,000 shares to its investors.
 
As of the date hereof, the only business of the Company is its ownership of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Bank and the Trust. Except as specifically noted otherwise herein, the balance of the description of the Company’s business is a description of the Bank’s business.
 
On March 4, 2015, the Company effected a 1-for-10 reverse stock split.
 
On September 28, 2015, the Bank changed its name from Patriot National Bank to Patriot Bank, N.A.
 
On January 26, 2017, the Board appointed Richard A. Muskus, Jr. President of Patriot. Mr. Muskus had served as Executive Vice President and Chief Lending Officer of the Bank since February 2014. Mr. Muskus’ appointment replaced Peter D. Cureau who was acting as the Interim President and Chief Operating Officer of Patriot and who continued to work with Mr. Carrazza in the office of the Chairman through the first quarter of 2017.
 
On May 10, 2017, Joseph D. Perillo was appointed as Chief Financial Officer of Patriot effective as of May 9, 2017. Mr. Perillo’s appointment was in response to the resignation of Neil M. McDonnell, who was the Chief Financial Officer of Patriot from January 5, 2016 through May 9, 2017 and who resigned on that date as an Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
 
The Bedford branch was closed on February 28, 2018 and its business and staff transferred to the Scarsdale branch.
 
On May 10, 2018, the Bank completed its acquisition of Prime Bank, a Connecticut bank headquartered in Orange, CT (“Prime Bank”). The closing of the transaction added a new Patriot branch located in the Town of Orange, New Haven County, Connecticut. The results of Prime Bank’s operations are included in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of acquisition.

Business Operations
 The Bank offers commercial real estate loans, commercial business loans, and a variety of consumer loans with an emphasis on serving the needs of individuals, small and medium-sized businesses and professionals. The Bank previously had offered loans on residential real estate, but discontinued doing so during 2013. The Bank’s lending activities are conducted principally in Fairfield and New Haven Counties in Connecticut and Westchester County in New York, although the Bank’s loan business is not necessarily limited to these areas.
 
Consumer and commercial deposit accounts offered include: checking, interest-bearing negotiable order of withdrawal (“NOW”), money market, time certificates of deposit, savings, Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (“CDARS”), Individual Retirement Accounts (“IRAs”), and Health Savings Accounts (“HSAs”). Other services offered by the Bank include Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) transfers, lockbox, internet banking, bill paying, remote deposit capture, debit cards, money orders, traveler’s checks, and automatic teller machines (“ATMs”). In addition, the Bank may in the future offer other financial services.
 
The Bank’s branch office locations are summarized as follows:
 

Branch No. | City | County | State 
-----------+-----------+-------------+------------
1 | Darien | Fairfield | Connecticut
2 | Fairfield | Fairfield | Connecticut
3 | Greenwich | Fairfield | Connecticut
4 | Milford | New Haven | Connecticut
5 | Norwalk | Fairfield | Connecticut
6 | Orange | New Haven | Connecticut
7 | Stamford | Fairfield | Connecticut
8 | Westport | Fairfield | Connecticut
9 | Scarsdale | Westchester | New York 

 

The Stamford, Connecticut location serves as Patriot’s headquarters. Additionally, the Bank also operates a loan origination office at its Stamford location.
 
The Bank’s employees perform most routine day-to-day banking transactions. The Bank has entered into a number of arrangements with third-party outside service providers, who provide services such as correspondent banking, check clearing, data processing services, credit card processing and armored car carrier transport.
 
In the normal course of business, subject to applicable government regulations, the Bank invests a portion of its assets in investment securities, which may include government securities. The Bank’s investment portfolio strategy is to maintain a balance of high-quality diversified investments that minimizes risk, maintains adequate levels of liquidity, and limits exposure to interest rate and credit risk. Guaranteed U.S. federal government issues currently comprise the majority of the Bank’s investment portfolio.
 
Patriot became an approved SBA lender at the end of 2017 and was designated a “preferred lender” by the SBA earlier in this year, enabling it to approve loans to small businesses and entrepreneurs more quickly and efficiently. In 2018, Patriot hired people to support new SBA business development in Stamford, Connecticut, Jacksonville, Florida, Atlanta, Georgia, and Indianapolis, Indiana.
 
Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, Patriot had 118 full-time equivalent employees. None of Patriot's employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.

Competition
 The Bank competes with a variety of financial institutions for loans and deposits in its market area. These include larger financial institutions with greater financial resources, larger branch systems and higher lending limits, as well as the ability to conduct larger advertising campaigns to attract business. The larger financial institutions may also offer additional services such as trust and international banking, which the Bank is not equipped to offer directly. When the need arises, arrangements are made with correspondent financial institutions to provide such services. To attract business in this competitive environment, the Bank relies on local promotional activities, personal contact by officers and directors, customer referrals, and its ability to distinguish itself by offering personalized and responsive banking service.
 
The customer base of the Bank generally is meant to be diversified, so that there is not a concentration of either loans or deposits within a single industry, a group of industries, or a single person or groups of people. The Bank is not dependent on one or a few major customers for its lending or deposit activities, the loss of any one of which would have a material adverse effect on the business of the Bank.
 
The Bank’s loan customers extend beyond the towns and cities in which the Bank has branch offices, including nearby towns in Fairfield and New Haven Counties in Connecticut, and Westchester County and the five boroughs of New York City in New York, although the Bank’s loan business is not necessarily limited to these areas. While the Bank does not currently hold or intend to attract significant deposit or loan business from major corporations with headquarters in its market area, the Bank believes that small manufacturers, distributors and wholesalers, and service industry professionals and related businesses, which have been attracted to this area, as well as the individuals that reside in the area, represent current and potential customers of the Bank.
 
In recent years, intense market demands, economic pressures, and significant legislative and regulatory actions have eroded banking industry classifications, which were once clearly defined, and have increased competition among banks, as well as other financial services institutions including non-bank competitors. This increase in competition has caused banks and other financial services institutions to diversify their services and become more cost effective. The impact of market dynamics, legislative, and regulatory changes on banks and other financial services institutions has increased customer awareness of product and service differences among competitors and increased merger activity among banks and other financial services institutions.
 
Supervision and Regulation
 As a bank holding company, the Company’s operations are subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Fed”). The Fed has established capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies that are similar to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s (“OCC”) capital guidelines applicable to the Bank. The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC”), limits the types of companies that a bank holding company may acquire or organize and the activities in which it or they may engage. In general, bank holding companies and their subsidiaries are only permitted to engage in, or acquire direct control of, any company engaged in banking or in a business so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. Federal legislation enacted in 1999 authorizes certain entities to register as financial holding companies. Registered financial holding companies are permitted to engage in businesses, including securities and investment banking businesses, which are prohibited to bank holding companies. The creation of financial holding companies has had no significant impact on the Company.
 
Under the BHC, the Company is required to file semi-annual reports of its operations with the Fed for the period ended June 30 and for the year ended December 31. Patriot and any of its subsidiaries are subject to examination by the Fed. In addition, the Company will be required to obtain the prior approval of the Fed to acquire, with certain exceptions, more than 5% of the outstanding voting stock of any bank or bank holding company, to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of a bank, or to merge or consolidate with another bank holding company. Moreover, Patriot and any of its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tying arrangements, in connection with any extension of credit or provision of any property or services. The Bank is also subject to certain restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on issuing any extension of credit to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or making any investments in the stock or other securities thereof, and on the taking of such stock or securities as collateral for loans to any borrower. If the Company wants to engage in businesses permitted to financial holding companies, but not to bank holding companies, it would need to register with the Fed as a financial holding company.

The Fed has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which expresses its view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the bank holding company’s net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividend and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the bank holding company’s capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. The Fed has also indicated that it would be inappropriate for a bank holding company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. Furthermore, under the prompt corrective action regulations adopted by the Fed, if any of its subsidiaries is classified as “undercapitalized”, the bank holding company may be prohibited from paying dividends.
 
A bank holding company is required to give the Fed prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities, if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of its consolidated retained earnings. The Fed may disapprove of such a purchase or redemption, if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law, regulation, Fed order, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Fed.
 
The Company is subject to capital adequacy rules and guidelines issued by the Fed and the FDIC and the Bank is subject to capital adequacy rules and guidelines issued by the OCC. These substantially identical rules and guidelines require Patriot to maintain certain minimum ratios of capital to adjusted total assets and/or risk-weighted assets. Under the provisions of the FDIC Improvements Act of 1991, the federal regulatory agencies are required to implement and enforce these rules in a stringent manner. The Company is also subject to applicable provisions of Connecticut law, insofar as they do not conflict with, or are not otherwise preempted by, federal banking law. Patriot’s operations are subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the FDIC and the OCC.
 
Federal and state banking regulations govern, among other things, the scope of the business of a bank, a bank holding company, or a financial holding company, the investments a bank may make, deposit reserves a bank must maintain, the establishment of branches, and the activities of a bank with respect to mergers and acquisitions. The Bank is a member of the Fed and, as such, is subject to applicable provisions of the Federal Reserve Act and regulations thereunder. The Bank is subject to the federal regulations promulgated pursuant to the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act that are designed to prevent banks from engaging in unsafe and unsound practices, as well as various other federal, state, and consumer protection laws. The Bank is also subject to the comprehensive provisions of the National Bank Act.
 
The OCC regulates the number and locations of branch offices of a national bank. The OCC may only permit a national bank to maintain branches in locations and under the conditions imposed by state law upon state banks. At this time, applicable Connecticut banking laws do not impose any material restrictions on the establishment of branches by Connecticut banks throughout Connecticut. New York State law is similar; however, the Bank cannot establish a branch in a New York town with a population of less than 50,000 inhabitants, if another bank is headquartered in that town.
 
The earnings and growth of Patriot and the banking industry in general are affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States (“U.S.”) government and its agencies, particularly the Fed. The Open Market Committee of the Fed implements national monetary policy to curb inflation and combat recession. The Fed uses its power to adjust interest rates on U.S. government securities, the discount rate, and deposit reserve retention rates. The actions of the Fed influence the growth of bank loans, investments, and deposits. They also affect interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits. The nature and impact of any future changes in monetary policies cannot be predicted.
 
In addition to other laws and regulations, Patriot is subject to the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”), which requires the federal bank regulatory agencies, when considering certain applications involving Patriot, to consider Patriot’s record of helping to meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA was originally enacted because of concern over unfair treatment of prospective borrowers by banks and unwarranted geographic differences in lending patterns. Existing banks have sought to comply with the CRA in various ways; some banks have made use of more flexible lending criteria for certain types of loans and borrowers (consistent with the requirement to conduct safe and sound operations), while other banks have increased their efforts to make loans to help meet identified credit needs within the consumer community, such as those for home mortgages, home improvements, and small business loans. Compliance may also include participation in various government insured lending programs, such as Federal Housing Administration insured or Veterans Administration guaranteed mortgage loans, Small Business Administration loans, and participation in other types of lending programs such as high loan-to-value ratio conventional mortgage loans with private mortgage insurance. To date, the market area from which the Bank draws much of its business is in the towns and cities in which the Bank has branch offices, which are characterized by a very diverse ethnic, economic and racial cross-section of the population. As the Bank expands further, the market areas served by the Bank will continue to evolve. The Company and the Bank have not and will not adopt any policies or practices, which discourage credit applications from, or unlawfully discriminate against, individuals or segments of the communities served by the Bank.

On October 26, 2001, the United and Strengthening America by Providing Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the “Patriot Act”) was enacted to further strengthen domestic security following the September 11, 2001 attacks. The Patriot Act amended various federal banking laws, particularly the Bank Secrecy Act, with the intent to curtail money laundering and other activities that might be undertaken to finance terrorist actions. The Patriot Act also requires that financial institutions in the U.S. enhance already established anti-money laundering policies, procedures and audit functions, and ensure that controls are reasonably designed to detect instances of money laundering through certain correspondent or private banking accounts. Verification of customer identification, maintenance of said verification records, and cross-checking names of new customers against government lists of known or suspected terrorists is also required. The Patriot Act was reauthorized and modified with the enactment of The USA Patriot Act Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005.
 
The Company is subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and, in accordance with the Exchange Act, files periodic reports, proxy statements, and other information with the SEC.
 
On July 20, 2002, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley”) was enacted, the primary purpose of which is to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures made pursuant to the securities laws, and for other purposes. Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, entitled Management Assessment of Internal Controls, requires that each annual report include an internal control report which states that it is the responsibility of management for establishing and maintaining an adequate internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting, as well as an assessment by management of the effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. This section further requires that the external auditors attest to, and report on, the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting; although, Smaller Reporting Companies as defined by the SEC are exempt from this requirement. Sarbanes-Oxley contains provisions for the limitations of services that external auditors may provide, as well as requirements for the credentials of members of the Audit Committee of Patriot’s Board of Directors. In addition, Sarbanes-Oxley requires principal executive and principal financial officers to certify to the adequacy of internal controls over financial reporting and to the accuracy of financial information released to the public on a quarterly and annual basis. Specifically, Sarbanes-Oxley requires Patriot’s Chief Executive and Chief Financial officer to certify that, to their best of their knowledge, the financial information reported accurately presents the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and that it contains no untrue statement or omission of material fact. Patriot’s Chief Executive and Chief Financial officer also are required to certify to their responsibility for establishing and maintaining a system of internal controls, the design and implementation of which insures that all material information is made known to these officers or other responsible individuals; this certification also includes the evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures, and the impact thereof, on the Company’s financial reporting.
 
Recent Legislative Developments 
 Many of the provisions of The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank) are aimed at financial institutions that are significantly larger than Patriot. Notwithstanding this, there are many other provisions that Patriot is subject to and had to comply with since July 21, 2010, including any applicable rules promulgated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). As rules and regulations are promulgated by the agencies responsible for implementing and enforcing Dodd-Frank, Patriot will have to address them to ensure compliance with such applicable provisions. Management expects the cost of compliance to increase, due to the regulatory burden imposed by Dodd-Frank.
 
Dodd-Frank also broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments. Under rules issued by the FDIC in February 2011, the base for insurance assessments changed from domestic deposits to consolidated assets less tangible equity. Assessment rates are calculated using formulas that take into account the risks of the institution being assessed. The rule was effective beginning April 1, 2011 and did not have a material impact on the Company.
 
Financial reform legislation and the implementation of any rules ultimately issued could have adverse implications on the financial industry, the competitive environment, and the Bank’s ability to conduct business.

In July 2013, the Fed, the FDIC, and the OCC approved final rules establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. Banking organizations (the “New Capital Rules”). The New Capital Rules generally implement the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s (the “Basel Committee”) December 2010 final capital framework (referred to as “Basel III”) for strengthening international capital standards. The New Capital Rules substantially revise the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries, including Patriot, as compared to the current U.S. general risk-based capital rules. The New Capital Rules revise the definitions and the components of regulatory capital, as well as address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios. The New Capital Rules also address asset risk weights and other matters affecting the denominator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios and replace the existing general risk-weighting approach with a more risk-sensitive approach, based, in part, on the “standardized approach” adopted by the Basel Committee in 2004. In addition, the New Capital Rules implement certain provisions of Dodd-Frank. The New Capital Rules became effective for Patriot on January 1, 2015. Patriot has not experienced any difficulties in complying with the New Capital Rules.
 
Recent Developments with Regulators 
 
In November 2018 the Bank entered into a formal written agreement (the “Agreement”) with the Office of the OCC. The Agreement states that by December 31, 2018 the Board and the Bank would develop, implement and revise written documents and policies related to executive compensation, conflict of interest, internal audit, liquidity and asset/liability management, commercial loan administration, leveraged lending, practices relating to the Allowance for Loan Losses, and assumptions used in the Bank’s interest rate risk model. Under the Agreement the Bank has also agreed to provide a revised written 3-year strategic and capital plan for the Bank by December 31, 2018. The Bank has provided the documents and policies requested in the Agreement and awaits further assessment by the OCC.
 
On October 29, 2018, the Company withdrew its initial application to the OCC requesting approval of the acquisition of Hana Small Business Lending, Inc. (“Hana SBL”) pursuant to a purchase agreement entered into on February 6, 2018 and amended on August 2, 2018. As of March 30, 2019, the Company has not received regulatory non-objection.
 
On March 30, 2019 the Company and Hana SBL mutually agreed to terminate the purchase agreement between the parties.  The termination agreement provides for the release of escrowed funds back to the Company.
