ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Overview 
We are a premier life science technology company that is designing, developing, and manufacturing advanced sequencing solutions that enable scientists and clinical researchers to improve their understanding of the genome and ultimately, resolve genetically complex problems. 
Our products and technology under development stem from two highly differentiated core technologies focused on accuracy, quality, and completeness, which include our existing HiFi long-read sequencing technology and our emerging Sequencing by Binding (SBB®) short-read sequencing technology. Our products address solutions across a broad set of applications including human genomics sequencing, plant and animal sciences, infectious disease and microbiology, oncology, and other emerging applications. Long-read sequencing was recognized by the journal Nature Methods as its “method of the year” for 2022 for its contributions to biological understanding and future potential.
Our focus is on providing our customers with advanced sequencing technologies with higher throughput and improved workflows that we believe will enable dramatic advancements in routine healthcare. 
Our customers include academic and governmental research institutions, commercial testing and service laboratories, genome centers, public health labs, hospitals and clinical research institutes, contract research organizations (CROs), pharmaceutical companies, and agricultural companies.
Recent Developments
On October 25, 2022, we announced two new sequencing platforms, RevioTM and OnsoTM.
Revio is a new long-read sequencing system designed to enable the use of HiFi sequencing for large studies in human genetics, cancer research, and agricultural genomics. We began taking orders for Revio in the fourth quarter of 2022 and expect to commence commercial Revio shipments in March 2023.
Onso, a short-read DNA sequencing system, is designed to deliver industry-leading sensitivity and specificity for novel insights in oncology, disease research, and other applications. We commenced the beta program for Onso in the fourth quarter of 2022. We began taking orders for Onso during the first quarter of 2023 and remain on track for commercial shipment in the second quarter of 2023.
Our Mission and Impact
Our mission is to enable the promise of genomics to better human health. Genomics is core to all biological processes, and our advanced genomics tools provide scientists and clinical researchers with the insights to better understand biology and health. The “promise of genomics” postulates that medicine, agriculture, public health, drug development, and other disciplines will be fundamentally transformed with the incorporation of routine genomic information over the coming decades. We see early progress toward this transformation in the applied use of genomics in areas such as genetic disease, oncology, and sustainable food production. However, legacy genomics technologies have fundamental limitations in progressing these fields toward the promise of genomics. We believe that unleashing the full potential of genomics will require a level of accuracy and completeness that is inaccessible to legacy technologies. Accuracy and completeness are central to our product development strategy, and thus we have created some of the most innovative and high-quality genomics solutions on the market. Our products also have enhanced multi-omic capabilities to look beyond the genome to the transcriptome and epigenome, which we believe is key to deep understanding.
The Underlying Science
Genetic inheritance in living systems is conveyed through a naturally occurring information storage system known as deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA. DNA stores information in linear chains of the chemical bases adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine, represented by the symbols A, C, G, and T respectively.
In humans, the genome is comprised of approximately three billion DNA base-pairs, which are divided into 23 chromosomes ranging in size from 50 million to 250 million bases. A human carries two copies of the chromosomes, one inherited from each parent. There are approximately 23,000 smaller regions within these chromosomes, called genes, which contain the blueprints for protein production. The proteins synthesized from these blueprints essentially underlie the operation of all biological systems. 
Genome sequencing reads the bases of long fragments of nucleic acids. Initial genome sequencing studies have shown that mutations in these DNA base-pairs play a critical role in human disease, contributing to the burgeoning field of genomics. Since then, recent discoveries have highlighted additional complexities of DNA and ribonucleic acid, or RNA. These discoveries include the presence of chemical modifications to the bases, such as methylation, and post-translational modification, or the processing of RNA molecules after they are transcribed from the genome, both of which can affect protein synthesis. 

Our Principal Markets 
Researchers utilize our solutions in human genomics, plant and animal sciences, infectious disease and microbiology, oncology, and other emerging applications.
Human Genomics: Improving rare disease research and understanding
According to a World Health Organization publication, it is estimated that 400 million people worldwide are affected by up to 8,000 distinct rare diseases, with 80% of these believed to be genetic in nature. These genetic diseases are DNA differences, called variants, in the affected individuals. Variants range in size from single nucleotide substitutions to large losses or gains of entire chromosomes. Other sequencing technologies applied to rare disease diagnosis are technologically limited to interrogating small variants, representing only a subset of possible genomic variation. Consequently, most genetic disease cases are undiagnosed, leaving families on multi-year diagnostic odysseys. Sequencing the human genome with long and accurate reads enables the potential detection of all known classes of disease-causing variation. In addition, the ability of PacBio’s long-read sequencing technology to detect 5-Methylcytosine DNA methylation, an epigenetic modification shown to alter gene behavior, may enable further advances in research and development in genetic disease diagnosis.
Infectious Disease and Microbiology: Understanding and tracking microbes and pathogens in support of global public health
Our technology has increased the scientific community’s understanding of microorganisms and viruses and their malignancy, transmission, and potential resistance to antibiotics or vaccines. Our sequencing technology delivers highly comprehensive and complete genomes, enabling federal agencies, public health organizations, and healthcare providers to conduct wide-ranging research and surveillance activities to:
generate high quality, complete genome assemblies, revealing variants of all known types, to gain a deeper understanding of community-acquired and hospital-associated infections and transmissions;
identify and characterize pathogens to inform regional, national, and global public health agencies for preparation and response to rapidly evolving microorganisms; and
characterize complex microbial communities to understand their role in human, animal, and environmental health.
Oncology: Enable the discoveries of underlying causes of cancer, progression, and relapse
Understanding the cellular and molecular complexity of tumor cells is critical in developing more effective targeted cancer therapies. Single-cell transcriptomics is particularly impactful in defining cellular identity and function; however, other technologies miss critical information by only sequencing a portion of RNA. Our long-read RNA sequencing method, single-cell Iso-Seq (scIso-Seq), accurately detects molecular events such as RNA isoforms and expressed mutations and provides gene expression information at the single-cell level. We believe scIso-Seq is uniquely positioned to enable discoveries by researchers of the underlying causes of cancer initiation, progression, and relapse, as well as the discovery by researchers of novel diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers that may inform future clinical tests. 
As novel discoveries continue to be made using our long-read sequencing technology, we believe our SBB short-read sequencing technology will enable us to meet the demands of customers in the expanding non-invasive testing market in oncology. Due to the small amounts of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) present in the blood of early-stage cancer patients and those with minimal residual disease (MRD), the presence of cancer often goes undetected, and a more sensitive assay will be required. Based on testing internally and at beta customer sites, we believe our SBB technology has the potential to offer higher accuracy than competitor sequencing technologies, which may in the future support our customers’ development of more sensitive tests for the purpose of earlier detection and more robust monitoring of cancer.
Plant and Animal Sciences: Helping scientists answer biological questions across a broad range of plant and animal sciences
There are hundreds of thousands of distinct plant and animal species. Our technology is used to build de novo reference genomes for these organisms across several global initiatives which are dedicated to preserving, monitoring, and cataloging biodiversity with actionable and accurate genomic data. 
Our Technology, Products, and Solutions
We have developed HiFi long-read sequencing based on Single-Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) technology, which accurately detects the nucleotide sequence and epigenetic status of individual DNA molecules. We are also expanding our genomic solutions with our short-read SBB chemistry, which offers sensitive sequencing for short-read applications. Upon launch of the SBB platform, we believe we will be the only company offering both native long-read and native short-read technologies into the market.
Our sales consist of sequencing instruments, nanofluidic chips (SMRT Cells), and reagents for preparing DNA and performing sequencing based on our SMRT technology; reagents for DNA extraction based on our nanobind technology; and the services we perform for customers. 

 

HiFi Long-Read Sequencing
Our HiFi long-read sequencing protocol was built upon our SMRT sequencing systems, including consumables and software, and offers customized end-to-end workflows for different sequencing applications. Highly accurate, long sequence reads simplify and accelerate data analysis algorithms, reducing the needs for error correction steps and/or assembly aspects, depending on the application.
Customers use our HiFi long-read sequencing platforms in a wide range of sequencing applications, including whole genome sequencing and de novo genome assembly, long-range phasing, targeted sequencing, full-length RNA and single-cell sequencing, characterization of metagenomic communities and other mixed DNA samples, viral genome sequencing, and others. Our technology is also capable of detecting epigenetic markers simultaneously by analyzing the kinetics of DNA polymerization that is affected, and thereby detectable, by epigenetic markers such as 5-methylcytosine or N6-methyladenine.
SMRT Technology
Our proprietary SMRT Technology enables the observation of DNA synthesis as it occurs in real time by harnessing the natural process of DNA replication, which in nature is a highly efficient and accurate process actuated by DNA polymerases. DNA polymerases attach to a strand of DNA to be replicated, examine the individual base at the point it is attached, and then determine which of the four building blocks, or nucleotides (A, C, G, or T), is required to complement that individual base. After determining which nucleotide is required, the polymerases incorporate that nucleotide into the growing strand being produced.
SMRT Sequencing is based on following the activity of DNA polymerase on individual DNA molecules in real time that occurs on our SMRT Cells that are monitored and analyzed within our HiFi long-read sequencing systems: the Revio system, Sequel II system, Sequel IIe system, and Sequel system. Carried out on SMRTbell® templates, which attach hairpin adapters to the ends of double-stranded DNA molecules to be sequenced, SMRT sequencing allows for the successive sequencing of both the forward and reverse strands of the individual DNA molecule occurring multiple times, thereby allowing for the same base of the same molecule to be sequenced more than once in a sequencing run. The base calls from the serial observation of the molecule can be processed to generate the final base call in an analytical procedure called circular consensus sequencing, leading to what we have defined as our HiFi sequence reads, which have high accuracy typically being defined as having greater than 99% read accuracy, but often exceeding greater than 99.9% accuracy, according to research we performed in collaboration with other researchers, subsequently published in Nature Biotechnology in 2019. HiFi reads typically are 15-20 kilobases in size, depending on the input fragments, providing sufficient read length with our accuracy to support a multitude of applications across human health, plant and animal, and microbiology, according to research we performed in collaboration with other researchers, subsequently published in Scientific Data in 2020. The ability to generate single-DNA molecule sequence reads that are both long and highly accurate allows researchers to obtain more contiguous, complete, and accurate genomic data, thereby allowing for greater insights into the complexity of biological systems.
HiFi Long-Read Sequencing Instruments: Revio system + Sequel systems 
Our Revio, Sequel, Sequel II, and Sequel IIe instruments conduct, monitor, and analyze single-molecule biochemical reactions in real time. The instruments use extremely sensitive imaging systems to collect the light pulses emitted by fluorescent reagents allowing the observation of biological processes. Computer algorithms are used to translate the information that is captured by the optics system. Using the recorded information, light pulses are converted into either an A, C, G, or T base call with associated quality metrics. Once sequencing is started, the real-time data is delivered to the system’s primary analysis pipeline, which outputs base identity and quality values.

 

HiFi Consumables
Customers purchase proprietary consumable products to run their PacBio systems, including our SMRT Cells and reagent kits. One SMRT Cell is consumed per sequencing reaction, and scientists can choose the number of SMRT Cells they use per experiment. 
We offer several reagent kits, each designed to address a specific step in the core sequencing workflow. A library preparation kit is used to convert DNA into SMRTbell double-stranded DNA library formats and includes typical molecular biology reagents, such as ligase, buffers, and exonucleases. Our binding kits include our modified DNA polymerase and are used to bind SMRTbell libraries to the polymerase in preparation for sequencing. Our core sequencing kits contain reagents required for on-instrument, real-time sequencing, including phospholinked nucleotides. 
We have also developed and offer the Multiplexed Arrays Sequencing (MAS-Seq) 3’ kit to enable cost-effective long-read single-cell RNA sequencing for a more complete interrogation of the transcriptome. The MAS-Seq kit takes single-cell cDNA as an input and outputs a sequencing-ready library, which enables researchers to move beyond gene counting to get full-length isoform information, characterize the full diversity of transcript isoforms at the single-cell level and ultimately reveal cell type-specific spliced isoforms and expressed variants. 
In addition, we offer HiFiViral for SARS-CoV-2, our first fit-for-purpose, end-to-end solution for COVID-19 genome sequencing. This solution uses a differentiated molecular inversion probe (MIPs) design that is robust to the emergence of new variants in the COVID-19 genome and allows for detection of all known classes of variation across the entire viral genome. Both characteristics are required for efficient and effective public health surveillance programs battling the COVID-19 pandemic. The solution also includes fit-for-purpose software that enables automated variant calling and preparation of files for submission into public databases tracking the evolution of the COVID-19 genome.
SBB Short-Read Sequencing
In contrast to SMRT sequencing, SBB reads short fragments of DNA (hundreds of bases instead of kilobases) in a massively parallel manner. Current short-read next generation sequencing technologies available in the market incur various rates of errors in results. Researchers deploy multiple tactics to try to mitigate these effects, including oversampling or implementing complex library preparation methods, yet still face challenges, including missing rare variants.
We believe our proprietary SBB approach will enable researchers to address the gap in detecting rare variants, especially in complex heterogenous samples. Employing a two-phase sequencing chemistry, the SBB approach binds a dye-labeled nucleotide without incorporation into the DNA chain, then removes that base, then blocks and extends with a terminated nucleotide. Using nucleotides with single modifications, we incorporate more native bases, avoiding potential scarring due to fluorescent linker presence. This design helps avoid raw errors and we believe can help us develop a product with substantially greater accuracy than currently marketed short-read sequencing products. SBB enables simplified upfront library preparation, redefines coverage requirements, and reduces bioinformatic workload for downstream analysis. The accuracy of our novel sequencing approach has the potential to advance translational cancer research, drive higher fidelity single-cell applications, and broadly enable clinical sequencing—even in regions of the genome prone to sequencing errors with other short-read sequencing technologies.
SBB Short-Read Sequencing Instrument: Onso system 
Our Onso instrument, currently under development, conducts, monitors, and analyzes SBB biochemical reactions. The instrument uses extremely sensitive imaging systems to collect the light emitted by fluorescent reagents allowing the observation of biological processes. Computer algorithms are used to translate the information that is captured by the optics system. Using the recorded information, light pulses are converted into either an A, C, G, or T base call with associated quality metrics. Once sequencing is started, the imaging data is delivered to the system’s primary analysis pipeline, which outputs base identity and quality values.
SBB Consumables
After Onso’s anticipated launch in the second quarter of 2023, our SBB consumable products will be available for purchase, including flow cells, clustering, and sequencing reagent kits. One flow cell and associated sequencing reagent pack is consumed per sequencing reaction. Each flow cell contains two lanes and scientists can choose to sequence different samples in each lane while additionally combining any number of flow cells needed per experiment. 
We intend to offer several reagent kits, each designed to address a specific step in the core sequencing workflow. A library preparation kit is used to convert DNA into SBB compatible, double-stranded DNA library formats and includes typical molecular biology reagents, such as ligase, buffers, and exonucleases. Additionally for library preparation, our conversion kits include reagents to enable scientists to convert existing sequencing libraries into an SBB compatible format. Finally, our clustering and sequencing kits contain all reagents required for generating sequence ready clusters on flow cell and performing SBB sequencing reactions on instrument, respectively.

Marketing, Sales, Service, and Support 
We market our products through a global sales force and through distribution partners in Asia and Australia, certain parts of Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and Latin America. We plan to continue to invest in growing our marketing, sales, service, and support resources as we drive continued adoption of products, launch new products, and expand our customer base.
Our business is subject to seasonal trends. See the Risk Factors section, specifically the risk factor titled Our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year over year, which makes our future results difficult to predict and could negatively impact the market price of our common stock for additional information.
Customers 
Our customers include academic and governmental research institutions, commercial testing and service laboratories, genome centers, public health labs, hospitals and clinical research institutes, contract research organizations (CROs), pharmaceutical companies, and agricultural companies. In general, our customers will isolate, prepare, and analyze genetic samples using PacBio sequencing systems in their own laboratories, or they will send their genetic samples to third-party service providers who in turn will sequence the samples with PacBio systems and provide the sequence data back to the customer for further analysis. For example, customers in academic research institutions may have bacteria, animal, or human DNA samples isolated from various sources while agricultural biology companies may have DNA samples isolated from different strains of rice, corn, or other crops. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, one customer accounted for approximately 12%, 13%, and 14% of our total revenue, respectively.
We believe that the majority of our current customers are early adopters of sequencing technology. By focusing our efforts on high-value applications, and developing whole product solutions around these applications, we seek to drive the adoption of our products across a broader customer base and into numerous large-scale projects. In general, the broader adoption of new technologies by mainstream customers can take a number of years. 
Backlog 
As of December 31, 2022, our instrument backlog was approximately $45.4 million, compared to $2.0 million as of December 31, 2021. We define backlog as purchase orders or signed contracts from our customers, which we believe are firm and for which we have not yet recognized revenue. We expect to convert this backlog to revenue during 2023; however, our ability to do so is subject to customers who may seek to cancel or delay their orders even if we are prepared to fulfill them. 
Manufacturing 
We manufacture sequencing instruments, SMRT cells, and reagents. Our key manufacturing and service facility in Menlo Park, California has received ISO 13485 and ISO 9001 certifications for the design, development, manufacture, distribution, installation, and servicing of its nucleic acid sequencing platforms. We utilize subcontract manufacturers for components of the manufacturing process. We purchase both custom and off-the-shelf components from a large number of suppliers and subject them to significant quality specifications. We periodically conduct quality audits of most of our critical suppliers and have established a supplier certification program. Some of the components required in our products are currently either sole sourced or single sourced. 

Research and Development 
We have historically made and plan to continue to make significant investments in research and development. Our research and development efforts focus on programs to develop new and existing platforms, as well as increasing throughput and decreasing costs on behalf of our customers. We are currently developing higher throughput platforms that encompass our HiFi long-read sequencing. Our mid-throughput short-read Sequencing by Binding platform, Onso, is currently under development. In addition to platform development, we also innovate across end-to-end workflows to improve usability, as well as develop new applications for the advancement of human health. 
Intellectual Property 
Developing and maintaining a strong intellectual property portfolio is an important element of our business. We have sought, and will continue to seek, patent protection for our SMRT and SBB technology, for improvements to our SMRT and SBB technology, as well as for any of our other technologies where we believe such protection will be advantageous. 
Our current patent portfolio, including patents exclusively licensed to us, is directed to various technologies, including SMRT nucleic acid sequencing and other methods for analyzing biological samples, ZMW arrays, surface treatments, phospholinked nucleotides and other reagents for use in nucleic acid sequencing, optical short-read nucleic acid sequencing, nucleic acid preparation, and purification components and systems, processes for identifying nucleotides within nucleic acid sequences, and processes for analysis and comparison of nucleic acid sequence data. Some of the patents and applications that we own, as well as some of the patents and applications that we have licensed from other parties, are subject to U.S. government march-in rights, whereby the U.S. government may disregard our exclusive patent rights on its own behalf or on behalf of third parties by imposing licenses in certain circumstances, such as if we fail to achieve practical application of the U.S. government funded technology, because action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs, to meet requirements of federal regulations, or to give preference to U.S. industry. In addition, U.S. government funded inventions must be reported to the government and U.S. government funding must be disclosed in any resulting patent applications. 
As of December 31, 2022, we own or hold exclusive licenses to 406 issued U.S. patents, 100 pending U.S. patent applications, 396 granted foreign patents, and 158 pending foreign patent applications, including foreign counterparts of U.S. patent and patent applications. The full term of the issued U.S. patents will expire between 2023 and 2041. We also have non-exclusive patent licenses with various third parties to supplement our own large and robust patent portfolio. 
Of our exclusively licensed patent applications, two issued U.S. patents are licensed to us by the Cornell Research Foundation, which manages technology transfers on behalf of Cornell University. 
Other Sequencing Solutions 
There are a significant number of companies offering nucleic acid sequencing equipment or consumables. These include, but are not limited to, Illumina, Inc. (“Illumina”), BGI Genomics (also known as MGI or Complete Genomics), Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (“Thermo”), Oxford Nanopore Technologies Ltd. (“ONT Ltd.”), Roche Holding AG (“Roche”), Qiagen N.V. (“Qiagen”), Element Biosciences, Inc. (“Element”), Bionano Genomics, Inc. (“Bionano”), Ultima Genomics, Inc. (“Ultima”) and Singular Genomics Systems, Inc. (“Singular”). These companies may have different levels of financial, technical, manufacturing, administrative, and support resources available to them. We expect the competition to intensify within the overall nucleic acid sequencing market as there are also several companies developing new sequencing technologies, products and/or services. Increased competition may result in pricing pressures, which could harm our sales, profitability, or share of supply.
In order for us to maintain and increase our sales, we will need to demonstrate that our products deliver superior performance and value as a result of our key differentiators. Our HiFi long-read sequencing will need to continue to deliver very high consensus accuracy and long-read lengths and include single-molecule, real-time resolution, with the ability to detect real-time kinetic information, fast time to result and flexibility, as well as support the breadth and depth of current and future applications. 
Government Regulation
The development, testing, manufacturing, marketing, post-market surveillance, distribution, advertising, and labeling of certain medical devices, including in vitro diagnostic products and laboratory-developed tests, are subject to regulation in the United States by the Center for Devices and Radiological Health of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and comparable state and foreign regulatory agencies. FDA defines a medical device as an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including any component part or accessory, which is (i) intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals, or (ii) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals and which does not achieve any of its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not dependent upon being 

 
metabolized for the achievement of any of its primary intended purposes. Medical devices to be commercially distributed in the United States must receive from the FDA either clearance of a pre-market notification, known as 510(k), or pre-market approval pursuant to the FDC Act prior to marketing, unless subject to an exemption.
We intend to label and sell our products for research use only (“RUO”) and expect to sell them to research customers in various settings, including academic institutions, life sciences and research laboratories that conduct research, and biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for non-diagnostic and non-clinical purposes. Our current RUO products are not intended or promoted for use in clinical practice in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, and they are labeled for research use only, not for use in diagnostic procedures. Accordingly, we believe our products, as we intend to market them, are not subject to regulation by the FDA. Rather, while FDA regulations require that RUO products be labeled for research use only and to market and distribute RUO products in accordance with the FDA RUO guidance, the regulations do not subject RUO products to the FDA’s jurisdiction or the broader pre- and post-market controls for medical devices. However, in the future, certain of our products or related applications, such as those that may be developed for clinical uses, could be subject to FDA regulation, or the FDA’s regulatory jurisdiction could be expanded to include our products. If we wish to label and expand product lines to address the diagnosis of disease, regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries will become an increasingly significant factor in development, testing, production, and marketing. In the future, products that we may develop in the molecular diagnostic markets, depending on their intended use, may be regulated as medical devices or in vitro diagnostic products (“IVDs”) by the FDA and comparable agencies in other countries. In the U.S., if we market our products for use in performing clinical diagnostics, such products would be subject to regulation by the FDA under pre-market and post-market control as medical devices, unless an exemption applies, and we would be required to obtain either prior 510(k) clearance or prior pre-market approval from the FDA before commercializing the product. Obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals can be expensive and may involve considerable delay. Some countries have regulatory review processes that are substantially longer than U.S. processes. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in a timely manner and meet all of the local regulatory requirements including language and specific safety standards in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products could prevent us from marketing products in such countries or subject us to sanctions and fines. Changes to the current regulatory framework, including the imposition of additional or new regulations, could arise at any time during the development or marketing of our products. 
In November 2013, the FDA issued a final guidance on products labeled for research use only, which, among other things, reaffirmed that a company may not make any clinical or diagnostic claims about an RUO product, stating that merely including a labeling statement that the product is for research purposes only will not necessarily render the device exempt from the FDA’s clearance, approval, or other regulatory requirements if the totality of circumstances surrounding the distribution of the product indicates that the manufacturer knows its product is being used by customers for diagnostic uses or the manufacturer intends such a use. These circumstances may include, among other things, written or verbal marketing claims regarding a product’s performance in clinical diagnostic applications and a manufacturer’s provision of technical support for such activities. If FDA were to determine, based on the totality of circumstances, that our products labeled and marketed for RUO are intended for diagnostic purposes, they would be considered medical devices that will require clearance or approval prior to commercialization. Further, sales of devices for diagnostic purposes may subject us to additional healthcare regulation. We continue to monitor the changing legal and regulatory landscape to ensure our compliance with any applicable rules, laws and regulations. 
The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices deemed to pose lower risk to the patient are placed in either class I or II, which, unless an exemption applies, requires the manufacturer to submit a pre-market notification requesting FDA clearance for commercial distribution pursuant to Section 510(k) of the FDCA. This process, known as 510(k) clearance, requires that the manufacturer demonstrate that the device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared and legally marketed 510(k) device or a “pre-amendment” class III device for which pre-market approval applications (“PMAs”) have not been required by the FDA. This FDA review process typically takes from four to twelve months, although it can take longer. Most Class I devices are exempted from this 510(k) pre-market submission requirement. If no legally marketed predicate can be identified for a new device to enable the use of the 510(k) pathway, the device is automatically classified under the FDCA as Class III, which generally requires pre-market approval, or PMA approval. However, the FDA can reclassify or use “de novo classification” for a device that meets the FDCA standards for a Class II device, permitting the device to be marketed without PMA approval. To grant such a reclassification, FDA must determine that the FDCA’s general controls alone, or general controls and special controls together, are sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness. The de novo classification route is generally less burdensome than the PMA approval process.
Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting, or implantable devices, or those deemed not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device, are placed in class III. Class III devices typically require PMA approval. To obtain PMA approval, an applicant must demonstrate the reasonable safety and effectiveness of the device based, in part, on data obtained in clinical studies. All clinical studies of investigational medical devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with FDA’s investigational device exemption (“IDE”) regulations, including the requirement for the study sponsor to submit an IDE application to FDA, unless exempt, which must become effective prior to commencing human clinical studies. PMA reviews generally last between one and two years, 

 
although they can take longer. Both the 510(k) and the PMA processes can be expensive and lengthy and may not result in clearance or approval. If we are required to submit our products for pre-market review by the FDA, we may be required to delay marketing and commercialization while we obtain pre-market clearance or approval from the FDA. There would be no assurance that we could ever obtain such clearance or approval.
All medical devices, including IVDs, that are regulated by the FDA are also subject to the quality system regulation. Obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals, including the FDA quality system inspections that are required for PMA approval, can be expensive and may involve considerable delay. The regulatory approval process for such products may be significantly delayed, may be significantly more expensive than anticipated, and may conclude without such products being approved by the FDA. Without timely regulatory approval, we will not be able to launch or successfully commercialize such diagnostic products. Changes to the current regulatory framework, including the imposition of additional or new regulations, could arise at any time during the development or marketing of our products. This may negatively affect our ability to obtain or maintain FDA or comparable regulatory clearance or approval of our products in the future. In addition, regulatory agencies may introduce new requirements that may change the regulatory requirements for us or our customers, or both.
As noted above, although our products are currently labeled and sold for research purposes only, the regulatory requirements related to marketing, selling, and supporting such products could be uncertain and depend on the totality of circumstances. This uncertainty exists even if such use by our customers occurs without our consent. If the FDA or other regulatory authorities assert that any of our RUO products are subject to regulatory clearance or approval, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely affected.
For example, in some cases, our customers, including laboratories that offer services as part of our certified service provider program, may use our RUO products in their own laboratory-developed tests (“LDTs”) or in other FDA-regulated products for clinical diagnostic use. The FDA has historically exercised enforcement discretion in not enforcing the medical device regulations against LDTs and LDT manufacturers. However, on October 3, 2014, the FDA issued two draft guidance documents that set forth the FDA’s proposed risk-based framework for regulating LDTs, which are designed, manufactured, and used within a single laboratory. In January 2017, the FDA announced that it would not issue final guidance on the oversight of LDTs and LDT manufacturers but would seek further public discussion on an appropriate oversight approach and give Congress an opportunity to develop a legislative solution. The FDA has issued warning letters to genomics labs for illegally marketing genetic tests that claim to predict patients’ responses to specific medications, noting that the FDA has not created a legal “carve-out” for LDTs and retains discretion to take action when appropriate, such as when certain genomic tests raise significant public health concerns. As laboratories and manufacturers develop more complex genetic tests and diagnostic software, the FDA may increase its regulation of LDTs. Legislative and administrative proposals to amend the FDA's oversight of LDTs have been introduced in recent years, including the Verifying Accurate Leading-edge IVCT Development Act of 2021 (the “VALID Act”). In September 2022, Congress passed the FDA user fee reauthorization legislation without substantive FDA policy riders, including the VALID Act, but Congress may revisit the policy riders and enact other FDA programmatic reforms in the future. Any future legislative or administrative rule making or oversight of LDTs and LDT manufacturers, if and when finalized, may impact the sales of our products and how customers use our products, and may require us to change our business model in order to maintain compliance with these laws. We would become subject to additional FDA requirements if our products are determined to be medical devices or if we elect to seek 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval. If our products become subject to FDA regulation as medical devices, we would need to invest significant time and resources to ensure ongoing compliance with FDA quality system regulations and other post-market regulatory requirements.
If our products become subject to FDA regulation as medical devices, the regulatory clearance or approval and the maintenance of continued and post-market regulatory compliance for such products will be expensive, time-consuming, and uncertain both in timing and in outcome. Commercialization of such regulated medical devices can increase our exposure under additional laws. For example, medical device companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business and may constrain the financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, as well as sell, market and distribute any medical products for which we obtain marketing authorization. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, data privacy and security, and transparency laws and regulations related to payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare providers. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment. 
In the future, to the extent we develop any clinical diagnostic assays, we may pursue payment for such products through a diverse and broad range of channels and seek coverage and reimbursement by government health insurance programs and commercial third-party payors for such products. In the United States, there is no uniform coverage for clinical laboratory tests. The extent of coverage and rate of payment for covered services or items vary from payor to payor. Obtaining coverage 

 
and reimbursement for such products can be uncertain, time-consuming, and expensive, and, even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status were attained for our tests, to the extent applicable, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. Changes in healthcare regulatory policies could also increase our costs and subject us to additional regulatory requirements that may interrupt commercialization of our products, decrease our revenue and adversely impact sales of, and pricing of and reimbursement for, our products.
International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. In the future, if we decide to distribute or market our diagnostic products as IVDs in Europe, such products are subject to regulation under the European Union (“EU”) IVD Medical Device Regulation (“IVDR”) EU 2017/746. Outside of the EU, regulatory approval needs to be sought on a country-by-country basis in order to market medical devices. Although there is a trend towards harmonization of a quality system, standards and regulations in each country may vary substantially, which can affect timelines of introduction.
We are committed to the protection of our employees and the environment. Our operations require the use of hazardous materials that subject us to various federal, state, and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. We believe that we are in material compliance with current applicable laws and regulations. However, we could be held liable for damages and fines should contamination of the environment or individual exposures to hazardous substances occur. In addition, we cannot predict how changes in these laws and regulations, or the development of new laws and regulations, will affect our business operations or the cost of compliance.
Additionally, we must comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, anti-competition regulations and sanctions imposed by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, and other similar laws and regulations. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on our business conduct, and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our ability to attract and retain employees, our international operations, our business, and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies.
As we continue to expand our business into multiple international markets, our success will depend, in large part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations. Any of these risks could harm our international operations and negatively impact our sales, adversely affecting our business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects.
Human Capital 
As of December 31, 2022, we had 769 full-time employees. Of these employees, 352 were in research and development, 64 were in operations, 36 were in service, 204 were in marketing, sales, and customer support, and 113 were in general and administration. With the exception of our field-based sales, marketing, and service teams, the majority of our employees are in California. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with respect to their employment. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 
Talent Acquisition and Retention
We recognize that our employees largely contribute to our success. To this end, we support business growth by seeking to attract and retain best-in-class talent. Our talent acquisition team uses internal and external resources to recruit highly skilled candidates globally. 
Total Rewards
Our total rewards philosophy has been to invest in our workforce by offering competitive and fair compensation and benefits packages. We provide employees with compensation packages that include base salary, short-term incentives such as annual bonuses and commissions, and long-term equity awards. We also offer comprehensive employee benefits, which vary by country and region, such as life, disability, and health insurance, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, paid parental leave, Employee Stock Purchase Program, and a 401(k) plan. It is our expressed intent to be an employer of choice in our industry by providing market-competitive compensation and benefits packages.
Health, Safety, and Wellness
The health, safety, and wellness of our employees is a priority in which we have always invested and will continue to do so. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of innovative, flexible, and convenient health and wellness programs. Program benefits are intended to provide protection and security, so employees can have peace of mind concerning events that may require time away from work or that may impact their financial well-being. These programs are highlighted regularly in our monthly human resources newsletters.

 

We continue our investments in, and the prioritization of, employee health, safety, and wellness in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. To protect and support our essential team members, we have implemented health and safety measures that included a mandatory vaccination policy for our U.S.-based employees, maximizing personal workspaces, changing shift schedules, and providing personal protective equipment (PPE). We have also supported access to testing by holding on-site testing clinics available to employees and their family members. We continue to monitor this evolving situation and will continue to seek programs to educate and assist employees whenever possible. 
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
We believe a diverse workforce is critical to our success. Our mission is to value differences in races, ethnicities, religions, nationalities, genders, ages, sexual orientations, as well as education, skill sets and experience. We offer training programs on diversity awareness to help employees understand, recognize, respond, and prevent bias throughout the employee lifecycle. We are focused on inclusive hiring practices, fair and equitable treatment, organizational flexibility, and training and resources.
Training and Development
We believe in encouraging employees to becoming lifelong learners by providing ongoing learning and leadership training opportunities. We provide a scaled learning platform of on-demand and virtual classroom learning focused on personal and professional development. While we strive to provide real-time recognition of employee performance, we have a formal annual review process not only to determine pay and equity adjustments tied to individual contributions, but to identify areas where training and development may be needed.
