Overview 
 MicroVision is a global developer of lidar hardware and software solutions focused primarily on automotive lidar and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) markets where we can deliver safe mobility at the speed of life. We develop a suite of light detection and ranging, or lidar, sensors and perception and validation software to the automotive market for ADAS and autonomous vehicle (AV) applications, as well as to complementary markets for non-automotive applications including industrial, robotics and smart infrastructure. Our long history of developing and commercializing the core components of our lidar hardware and related software, combined with the experience of the team we recently acquired from Ibeo Automotive Systems (Ibeo) with automotive-grade qualification, provides a potentially compelling advantage over the less-experienced recent entrants into this market. 
 Founded in 1993, MicroVision, Inc. is a pioneer in laser beam scanning, or LBS, technology, which is based on our patented expertise in micro-electromechanical systems, or MEMS, laser diodes, opto-mechanics, electronics, algorithms and software and how those elements are packaged into a small form factor. Throughout our history, we have combined our proprietary technology with our development expertise to create innovative solutions to address existing and emerging market needs, such as augmented reality microdisplay engines; interactive display modules; consumer lidar components; and, most recently, automotive lidar sensors and software solutions for the automotive market. 
 On January 31, 2023, we completed the acquisition of certain assets of Ibeo Automotive Systems GmbH, which was founded in 1998 as a lidar hardware and software provider. Ibeo developed and launched the first lidar sensor to be automotive qualified for serial production with a Tier 1 automotive supplier and that is currently available in passenger cars by premium OEMs. Ibeo developed software solutions, including perception and validation software, which are also used by premium OEMs. In addition, Ibeo sold its products for non-automotive uses such as industrial, smart infrastructure and robotics applications. 
 For the automotive market, our integrated solution combines our MEMS-based dynamic-range lidar sensor and perception software, to be integrated on our custom ASIC, targeted for sale to premium automotive OEMs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers. We believe that our MEMS-based lidar sensor, or MAVIN sensor, and perception software demonstrates best-in-class features and performance that exceed market expectations and outperform competitive products. Our ADAS solution is intended to leverage edge computing and custom ASICs to enable our hardware and perception software to be integrated into an OEM’s ADAS stack. 
 In addition to our dynamic-range and long-range MAVIN sensor and perception software solution for the automotive market, our product suite includes short- and mid-range lidar sensors, both MEMS-based and flash-based, for automotive and industrial applications, including smart infrastructure, robotics, and other commercial segments. Also, our validation software tool is used by OEMs and other customers including Tier 1s for validating vehicle sensors for ADAS and AV applications. The tool includes software that automates the manual data classification or annotation process, significantly reducing the time and resources required by OEMs to validate their ADAS and AV systems. 
 In the recent past, we developed micro-display concepts and designs for use in head-mounted augmented reality, or AR, headsets and developed a 1440i MEMS module supporting AR headsets. We also developed an interactive display solution targeted at the smart speakers market and a small consumer lidar sensor for use indoors with smart home systems.

 We completed the acquisition of Ibeo assets on January 31, 2023 pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of the Asset Purchase Agreement, dated December 1, 2022, by and between our wholly owned subsidiary, MicroVision GmbH organized under the laws of The Federal Republic of Germany, and Ibeo Automotive Systems GmbH for a purchase price of EUR 15,000,000, or approximately $16.1 million, subject to potential reduction on the terms set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement. In addition to the purchase price, pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, we advanced funds to Ibeo so that it could continue its operations while in insolvency during the period between signing and closing. Specifically, in December 2022, we advanced approximately $4.1 million in operating funds, which included costs related to headcount reductions carried out by Ibeo management, decreasing the number of employees to transfer in connection with the acquisition to approximately 250 employees. These headcount reduction costs will be reimbursed to MicroVision by way of deduction from the purchase price in accordance with the Asset Purchase Agreement. We advanced an additional approximately $3.0 million to Ibeo in January 2023, a portion of which will also be reimbursed to us as a purchase price deduction. 
 The Company did not record any revenue during the year ended December 31, 2022 related to the Ibeo asset acquisition as the transaction closed at the end of January 2023. 
 We have been unable to secure the customers at the scale needed to successfully launch our products. We have incurred substantial losses since inception, and we expect to incur a significant loss during the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023. 
 MicroVision, Inc. was founded in 1993 as a Washington corporation and reincorporated in 2003 under the laws of the State of Delaware. Our headquarters is located at 18390 NE 68th Street, Redmond, Washington 98052, and our telephone number is (425) 936-6847.
Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports are available free-of-charge from the investor page of our website, accessible at www.microvision.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).    Copies of these filings may also be obtained by visiting the SEC’s website, www.sec.gov, which contains current, quarterly and annual reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically. 
 Our Industry and Market Strategy 
 We are developing our lidar sensors and perception software to address the needs of the Level 2+, or L2+, and Level 3, or L3, ADAS markets to be used in automotive safety and autonomous driving applications. Our MEMS-based high-speed lidar sensors, which we call MAVIN™, use our pioneering LBS technology. With our acquisition of Ibeo assets, we estimate our serviceable addressable market for the period 2025 to 2030 to be approximately 90 million long-range lidar sensors and 185 million short-range lidar sensors with a total cumulative potential revenue opportunity of approximately $82 billion. These estimates assume that L2+ functionality requires one long-range and two short-range lidar sensors for each vehicle and L3 functionality requires two long-range and four short-range lidar sensors for each vehicle, and that the average sales price per long-range lidar sensor is $500 and per short-range lidar sensor is $200. 
 Our solution-based development approach recognizes two key realities of the L2+ and L3 markets: that safety is mission-critical and that OEMs require cost efficiency and integration adaptability. With these factors in mind, we believe that our best-in-class MAVIN lidar sensors support critical safety needs by providing the highest resolution at range and velocity of moving objects with a dynamic field of view while running at 30 hertz, thus enabling ADAS features, such as automatic emergency braking, forward collision warning, and automatic emergency steering, at higher speeds of operation than most competing products. Moreover, we tailor our solution to meet the needs of OEMs, integrating our MEMS-based lidar and edge computing to support Highway Pilot capabilities up to 130km/h, save development cost and time for OEMs with no training required for our sensor-fused output, reduce system cost by requiring fewer and cheaper sensors and reduced processing, and enable seamless integration with an OEM’s existing architecture. Our unique solution for the L2+ and L3 markets, we believe, has the potential to achieve our goal of enabling mission-critical safety systems while solving for OEMs’ cost and integration objectives. 
 With this customer-centric approach, our go-to-market strategy depends on building partnerships with OEMs and Tier-1 automotive suppliers, as well as with silicon companies to support our solution on their compute platforms. Although we are working to establish direct marketing and co-development relationships with OEMs, we expect that our revenue may also be derived directly from Tier-1 suppliers in the form of licensing revenue.

 Our Technology and Competitive Strength 
 We believe a significant competitive strength for us today is our long history of delivering LBS- and MEMS-based hardware and related firmware and software that meets reliability, predictability, and scalability standards of well-known OEMs and ODMs. 
 Core to our automotive lidar sensors, custom ASICs and perception software is proprietary technology that we have been developing, refining, productizing and protecting for nearly 30 years. Our patented LBS technology combines a MEMS scanning mirror, laser diode light sources, electronics, and optics that are controlled using our proprietary system control algorithms along with edge computing and machine learning in some systems. The MEMS scanning mirror is a key component of our technology system and is one of our core competencies. Our MEMS scanning mirror is a silicon device that oscillates in a precisely controlled closed loop pattern so that we can place a pixel of light at a precise point. This allows us to generate a projected image pixel-by-pixel for use in lidar sensing and display. Scanning modules with our technology can be designed to operate in one of three different modes: lidar sensing only, display and lidar sensing combined, and display only. We believe that our proprietary technology offers significant advantages over other lidar sensing systems and traditional displays. 
 Early applications of our proprietary technology included heads up displays for the U.S. military and automotive systems. The contemplated uses of our technology require incorporation of our components into the products of other companies or partners. Most recently, our technology can be found in a Microsoft heads up display product. In the past, we have worked with other global brands to incorporate our core technology into their consumer products. 
 The MAVIN DR, our dynamic-range automotive lidar sensor is designed to, and we believe can, meet or exceed OEM specifications, performing to 220 meters of range with an output resolution of up to 15.0 million points per second. We believe that our hardware can deliver the highest point cloud density for a single-channel sensor as compared to competitive products. In addition to providing a low-latency, high-resolution point cloud at range, our sensor outputs axial, lateral, and vertical components of velocity of moving objects in the field of view at 30 hertz. This allows our solution to support a detailed understanding of the velocity of moving objects in real time, enabling fast and accurate path planning and maneuvering of the vehicle. Further, our proprietary scan locking feature ensures that our sensor is immune from interference from sunlight and from other lidar sensors. 
 In Augmented Reality (AR) applications, our technology enables high resolution of 1440i for large fields of view with low weight and low latency and persistence. Our Interactive Display gives an instant on and off, full color, focus-free, 720p projected image that is capable of responding as if it were a capacitance touch screen from any surface on which the projection can be seen. Our Consumer Lidar has a small size with high resolution, low power and low latency and is intended for use indoors to enable a smart home system to understand what is happening in the home and respond in an appropriate way. 
 Our Products and Revenue Strategy 
 Following our recent acquisition, our product suite includes our MEMS-based high-speed automotive lidar sensors, perception software, flash-based automotive lidar sensor, lidar sensors for non-automotive industrial markets, and reference and validation software. We also provide engineering services in connection with these hardware and software products. 
 Central to our development and commercialization efforts is our MAVIN DR dynamic view lidar system targeted for sale to automotive OEMs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers. MAVIN DR combines short-, medium- and long-range sensing and fields of view into one form factor. Dynamic range is key to enabling ADAS features at highway speeds. At speeds of up to 130 km/h (80 mph), ADAS systems need more time to make decisions and react in order to take proactive action and hence need resolution at range. Our MAVIN DR sensor produces an ultra-high-resolution point cloud showing drivable and non-drivable areas of the road ahead. With its low latency point cloud (30 hertz), the MAVIN product line allows ADAS systems to respond more quickly, make split-second decisions and take action at high speeds.

 Our perception software integrated with our automotive lidar hardware, and eventually ported into our digital ASIC, is also targeted for sale to automotive OEMs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers. This perception software, included in our acquisition of assets from Ibeo, has successfully passed through qualification processes with automotive OEMs. 
 Also included in our acquisition of assets are Ibeo’s sensors for the non-automotive industrial market and for the automotive market. These sensors support a revenue strategy that includes royalty revenues from automotive production, as well as sales in multiple markets including industrial, smart infrastructure, robotics, and commercial vehicles. 
 Our acquisition allows us to offer a system solution for validating vehicle sensors for ADAS and AV applications. The system includes software that automates the manual data classification or annotation process, significantly reducing the time and resources required by OEMs to validate their ADAS and AV systems. In addition to the auto-annotation software, sales of this validation solution may include our lidar sensors. 
 Beginning in the third quarter of 2019 and through the end of February 2020, we were selling components to a high-definition display system that we developed for Microsoft under a development agreement. The volume and resulting revenue and gross profit from this business was fairly low. Therefore, in March 2020, we transferred production of the components to the customer. Starting in March 2020 and through 2022, we earned a royalty from the customer for each unit shipped, with amounts applied against the prepayment that we had previously received from the customer until the prepayment is exhausted. The value of the royalty is approximately equal to the amount of gross profit we would have earned if we had continued to produce and ship the components. We believe this arrangement helps us conserve cash, while preserving our ability to experience financial benefits in the event the volume of components increases in the future. 
 
Research and Development 
 We believe our research and development efforts have earned us a leadership position in the field of lidar sensors, LBS technology and applications as applied to automotive, consumer electronics and other markets. Our ability to attract customers and grow revenue will depend on our ability to maintain our technology leadership, to continually improve performance, reduce costs, and ensure functional safety and flexible design. Our research and development teams as of December 31, 2022 were located in Redmond, Washington and Nuremberg, Germany and were comprised of 90 engineering and technical staff in optics, software engineering, electrical engineering, product engineering, and MEMS design. With the closing of our acquisition on January 31, 2023, our engineering and technical staff increased to approximately 295, adding a team in Hamburg, Germany. 
Sales and Marketing 
 Our sales and marketing approach is account based, business-to-business targeting of OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers. Our business development efforts are headed by executive management and business development representatives and are supported by engineers that assist customers during the design cycles of products. Our business development office for our automotive solution is located in Germany. We engage potential customers directly, participate in trade shows, and maintain a website. 
Manufacturing 
 Although we are not manufacturing products at significant volume at this time, in the past, when we have produced products or components, our products were manufactured by a contract manufacturer based on our proprietary design, process, test, quality, and reliability standards and incorporated our LBS technology and included MEMS and ASICs that were produced to order by semiconductor foundries. Our past manufacturing has not been subject to seasonal variations as our shipments have been relatively small and were in the early stages of product introduction. In the future, depending on our customers’ product mix, we may be affected by seasonal fluctuations which could affect working capital demands. Many of the raw materials used in our components are standard to the consumer electronics industry. Our MEMS, MEMS die, and ASICs have historically been manufactured to our specifications by separate single-source suppliers.

 Competitive Conditions 
 Many companies are attempting to develop lidar sensors and ADAS solutions; the competitive landscape is highly crowded and rapidly evolving. We compete with pureplay lidar developers, some of which have recently completed de-SPAC transactions raising significant capital. Some of these companies have announced partnerships with OEMs, Tier 1 suppliers, and contract manufacturers that, even if nonexclusive, may appear more credible than we do in the marketplace. We also face competition from OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers that have internally developed lidar sensors. All of these OEMs and Tier 1s are significantly larger, more well-resourced, have long operating histories and enjoy relevant brand recognition. Many lidar developers are also building ADAS solutions with which our solution competes. Our competitors may succeed in developing innovative technologies and products that could render our technology or products commercially infeasible or technologically obsolete. 
 The lidar sensing and consumer display industries have been characterized by rapid and significant technological advances. Our LBS technology system and products may not be competitive with such advances, and we may not have sufficient funds to invest in new technologies, products or processes. Although we believe our technology system and products could deliver higher performance and have other advantages, manufacturers of competing technologies may develop improvements to their technology that could reduce or eliminate the anticipated advantages of our products. 
 Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights 
 We create intellectual property from three sources: internal research and development activities, technology acquisitions, and performance on development contracts. The inventions covered by our patent applications generally relate to systems controls in our LBS technology, component miniaturization, power reduction, feature enhancements, specific implementation of various system components, and design elements to facilitate mass production. Protecting these key-enabling technologies and components is a fundamental aspect of our strategy to penetrate diverse markets with unique products. As such, we intend to continue to develop our portfolio of proprietary and patented technologies at the system, component, and process levels. 
 We believe our extensive patent portfolio is the largest, broadest, and earliest filed LBS technology portfolio. We currently have over 400 issued patents and pending patents worldwide. With the closing of the Ibeo acquisition on January 31, 2023, we added approximately 330 patents to our portfolio. As our technology develops, we periodically review our patent portfolio and eliminate patents that are deemed of low value. Due to this ongoing portfolio management practice, the number of patents in our portfolio will vary at any given time. 
 Since our inception in 1993, we have acquired through portfolio purchases, patents that grant us exclusive rights to various LBS technologies. From time to time some of these patents may expire or be abandoned to better utilize resources expended to maintain and generate new intellectual property. 
 Our ability to compete effectively in automotive lidar or any other market we may enter may depend, in part, on our ability and the ability of our licensors to maintain the proprietary nature of these technologies. 
 We also rely on unpatented proprietary technology. To protect our rights in these areas, we require all employees, and where appropriate, contractors, consultants, advisors and collaborators, to enter into confidentiality and non-compete agreements. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information. 
 We have registered the name “MAVIN™,” “PicoP®” and “MicroVision®” with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. 
 Our Employees, People Operations and Workplace Safety 
 As of February 24, 2023, throughout our global offices, we had approximately 350 full-time employees, which included the employees who joined MicroVision in connection with our acquisition of assets from Ibeo. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or works council.

 Our principal objectives with respect to our workforce are to attract, retain, motivate, and reward our employees to achieve positive results for our customers and for MicroVision. To achieve these objectives, our employee benefit programs seek to (i) support skill building and prepare our employees for advancement through continuous learning, (ii) reward our employees through compensation awards and resources intended to motivate our employees and promote well-being, and (iii) continuously identify opportunities for development through regular employee input and engagement. We offer competitive compensation and benefits. 
 We also strive for continuous improvement in diversity and inclusivity among our employees, management, and board of directors, and seek to promote job opportunities to a diverse pool of qualified candidates. We are also committed to providing an inclusive work environment free of discrimination or harassment of any kind, supported by policies, communications, and reporting and resolution resources. 
 Protecting the safety, health, and well-being of our employees is also a key priority and we have implemented policies and practices to support this. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have remained focused on the health and safety of our employees by implementing appropriate safety protocols. We have implemented work-from-home procedures where possible, required the wearing of masks and physical distancing on the job when called for by local guidelines, and increased cleaning procedures and provided cleaning supplies. 
 We work with third party independent experts in the field of laser safety to assist in meeting safety specifications. In addition, we monitor developments in the area of permissible laser exposure limits as established by International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and others. Independent experts have concluded that laser exposure to the eye resulting from use of LBS devices under normal operating conditions would be below the calculated maximum permissible exposure level set by the IEC. 
 Continuing Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business 
 Our business operations continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Government restrictions in the early days of the pandemic caused us to mostly close our offices in early 2020. To support our hardware development efforts, we reopened our offices in July 2021 while maintaining compliance with government mandates and health agency protocols, including masking requirements and encouraging vaccination. Many of our office employees continue to work on hybrid schedules or remotely. We may experience reductions in productivity and disruptions to our business routines while our hybrid work policy remains in place, or if our employees become ill and are unable to work, which could have an adverse effect on the timing of our development and productization activities. We will continue to prioritize the health and safety of our employees as we adapt our workplace policies based on evolving government regulation, health agency advice, and industry best practice. 
 In addition, several of our suppliers have experienced closures or have been operating at reduced capacity, resulting in lower component availability. Continued disruptions to our supply chain could have a material impact on our development and future operations. Moreover, various global travel restrictions and office closures have hampered our business development efforts, making it more difficult to engage with potential customers and partners, which could have a material negative impact on our business prospects.
