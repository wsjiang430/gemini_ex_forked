Item 1. Business
Overview
Our mission is to enable the rapid development of innovative therapeutics by pushing the frontiers of drug discovery technologies. We intend to achieve this mission by enabling the discovery of high-quality therapeutic candidates and by being the partner of choice for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. We believe that pairing the large and diverse antibody repertoires generated from our proprietary transgenic animals with our cutting-edge and high-throughput validated screening tools will deliver high-quality therapeutic candidates for a wide range of diseases.
Our OmniAb technology platform creates and screens diverse antibody repertoires and is designed to quickly identify optimal antibodies for our partners’ drug development efforts. We harness the power of Biological Intelligence™, which we built into our proprietary transgenic animals and pair with our high-throughput screening technologies to enable the discovery of high-quality, fully-human antibody therapeutic candidates. We believe these antibodies are high quality because they are naturally optimized in our proprietary systems for affinity, specificity, developability and functional performance. Our partners have access to these antibody candidates that are based on unmatched biological diversity and optimized through integration across a full range of technologies, including antigen design, transgenic animals, deep screening and characterization. We provide our partners both integrated end-to-end capabilities and highly customizable offerings, which address critical industry challenges and provide optimized antibody discovery solutions. As of December 31, 2022, we had 69 active partners with 291 active programs using the OmniAb technology, including 23 OmniAb-derived antibodies in clinical development by our partners and three approved products of our partners: (i) zimberelimab, which was approved in China for the treatment of recurrent or refractory classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma, (ii) sugemalimab (Cejemly®), which has been approved in China for the first-line treatment of metastatic (stage IV) non-small cell lung cancer in combination with chemotherapy, as well as for patients with unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer whose disease has not progressed following concurrent or sequential platinum-based chemoradiotherapy, and (iii) teclistamab (TECVAYLI®), which received accelerated approval in the U.S. for adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least four prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, and conditional marketing authorization in Europe as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.
At the heart of the OmniAb technology platform lies the Biological Intelligence of our proprietary transgenic animals, including OmniRat®, OmniMouse® and OmniChicken®, that have been genetically modified to generate antibodies with human sequences to facilitate development of human therapeutic candidates. Biological Intelligence refers to the ability of the immune system in our transgenic animals to create optimized antibodies through a process that has evolved over 500 million years. The immune system function is to adaptively respond to a given target through an iterative process of diversification and selection that produces novel antibodies with high affinity, specificity, and expression levels. Through its proprietary and carefully designed transgenes, OmniAb’s Biological Intelligence taps into this powerful in vivo process to generate human antibodies directly from its transgenic animals. OmniFlic® and OmniClic® are common light-chain rats and chickens, respectively, designed to generate bispecific antibodies. OmniTaur™ provides cow-inspired antibodies with unique structural characteristics for challenging targets. To our knowledge, we are the industry’s only four-species in vivo antibody discovery platform, making OmniAb the most diverse host system available in the industry. We believe natural antibodies are superior to other antibody generation methods because they are naturally optimized through an iterative in vivo process that preferentially selects antibodies to effectively bind to a specific antigen. Our technology can be leveraged to develop multiple therapeutic formats including mono-, bi- and multi-specific antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T). By generating large and diverse repertoires of high-quality antibodies, we believe Biological Intelligence increases the probability of success of therapeutic antibody discovery and helps limit the attrition of antibody product candidates in the clinic.
Our technology investments are methodical and deliberate, designed to enable our partner-centric business model to leverage the most cutting-edge solutions to solve the biggest challenges in antibody drug discovery. Some partners prefer integrated end-to-end discovery capabilities, while others prefer to use certain of our technologies within their own labs. This flexibility not only provides value to our partners, but also allows for greater scalability of our business since we do not have to build out capacity for partners that prefer to use some of their own technologies in the process. The breadth and depth of our partner-centric model benefits our investment decision making by providing critical insights into the needs and direction of the industry.
According to Vaccines journal, antibodies are among the fastest growing class of drugs and are used across multiple therapeutic areas including oncology, inflammation, and neurodegeneration. The favorable drug-like properties of antibodies, including high specificity, limited off-target toxicity, superior immune stimulation, and the ability to modulate half-life circulation in serum, have accelerated investment in antibody therapeutics. This has resulted in higher success rates for antibody therapeutics when compared to small molecule modalities, according to Clinical Development Success Rates and Contributing Factors 2011-2020, a study of over 9,000 clinical development programs published by PharmaIntelligence. These factors have led to substantial investment in antibody discovery, which we believe will continue to expand the total addressable market for antibody discovery technologies.
Despite industry momentum that has resulted in an overall increase in the number of antibody therapeutic approvals per year, drug discovery and development have become increasingly fragmented, outdated and non-robust. While many biotechnology companies bring a focused approach to science, their biological hypotheses are often tested utilizing suboptimal antibody discovery methods due to reliance on legacy technologies. Meanwhile, many larger companies have also continued to rely on legacy technologies, often due to the inability to selectively integrate newer technologies at their facilities or because the benefits of technological updates are limited by outdated workflows. Additionally, outsourced technologies that have tried to address these shortcomings often lack flexibility. These legacy approaches are burdened with critical disadvantages including low antibody diversity, lengthy discovery timelines, limited functional parameter data, excess costs or lack of flexibility.
We believe that by eliminating the need for each company to build a comprehensive antibody discovery engine, we can unlock innovation and value across a broad network of partners. Many emerging and established life sciences companies have been built around technologies that focus on a single or a limited number of steps in the discovery process, including antigen design, transgenic animal platforms, single-cell analysis, sequencing, bioinformatics, and proprietary assays. We believe our comprehensive, biologically-driven technology platform provides the industry with a cutting-edge solution for all critical components of the antibody discovery continuum. By providing leading antibody discovery solutions to the industry, we aim to increase the probability of success, reduce costs and shorten development timelines for our partners.
As depicted in the figure below, our technology platform is a suite of integrated technologies designed to discover a wide range of high-quality therapeutic antibodies that leverage the inherent diversity produced by our transgenic animals.
Our technologies within the OmniAb platform improve the productivity and efficiency of each step of the discovery process:
•Create Diverse Antibody Repertoires. We believe generating large and diverse repertoires of high-quality antibodies increases the likelihood of discovering the antibody with the most desirable therapeutic characteristics. At the heart of the OmniAb technology platform is the Biological Intelligence of our proprietary transgenic animals, technology that we own. Our animals have been genetically modified to produce a large number of naturally optimized, high-quality, fully-human antibodies. We offer the industry’s only four-species platform to address a wide range of biological challenges facing our partners in their antibody discovery efforts. We pair our Biological Intelligence with computational antigen design to generate robust antibody responses to biological targets, including but not limited to difficult and complex targets such as ion channels, G protein-coupled receptors (“GPCRs”), transporters, and other transmembrane proteins. Our antigen design technology includes transmembrane and cell-surface protein technology that we own or exclusively license.
•Screen Antibody Candidates. Our proprietary xPloration® microcapillary technology, which we own or license, and Gel Encapsulated Microenvironment (“GEM”) technology, which we own, screen repertoires of antibody-secreting B cells at a single-cell level to quickly identify antibodies in as little as a few hours, saving weeks compared to traditional technologies. xPloration characterizes tens of millions of antibody producing cells on multiple parameters, then leverages AI to analyze immense amounts of phenotypic data to automatically select and rank thousands of promising therapeutic candidates. Our industry-leading throughput allows for the discovery of rare antibodies that may otherwise be missed with traditional technologies.
•Identify the Right Antibody.  Our discovery teams are able, as needed, to work closely with partners to identify the right antibody for a particular target profile. Antibody candidates identified through our screening technologies are further characterized through a cascade of performance assays. The data from multi-parameter screening and performance assays is used in combination with bioinformatics to analyze the antibody repertoire and enable our partners to select the right antibody.
In addition to our antibody discovery solutions, we possess extensive biological capabilities focused on ion channels, transporters and x-ray fluorescence. Ion channels and transporters are key components in a wide variety of biological processes and have broad therapeutic applicability across cancer, metabolic disease, pain, neurological diseases, infectious diseases and others. In the search for new drugs, ion channels are a frequent, but challenging target. We believe our capabilities in the ion channel area can be leveraged for both small molecule and antibody approaches to therapeutic development.
We partner with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that vary in size, clinical stage, geography and therapeutic focus. Our license agreements are negotiated separately for each discovery partner, and as a result, the financial terms and contractual provisions vary from agreement to agreement. We structure our license agreements with partners to typically include: (i) upfront or annual payments for technology access and payments for performance of research services; (ii) downstream payments in the form of preclinical, intellectual property, clinical, regulatory, and commercial milestones; and (iii) royalties on net sales of our partners’ products, if any. We succeed when our partners are successful and our agreements are structured to align economic and scientific interests. An active program is counted once research work has commenced or an antigen is introduced into our animals and remains so as long as the program is actively being developed or commercialized. An active partner is counted if such partner has an active program or has executed a license agreement in advance of initiating an active program. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, our partners with active programs included Amgen, Boehringer Ingelheim, Genmab, GSK, Janssen, Merck KGaA, Pfizer, Roche, Sanofi, Seagen and Servier, among others. In addition, we work with academic partners including LifeArc, University of Oxford, The Scripps Research Institute, University of Maryland and the Wistar Institute.
For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our revenue was $59.1 million and $34.7 million respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our net loss was $22.3 million and $27.0 million, respectively. Historically, our revenue has been derived from payments for technology access, collaborative research services and milestones. We believe the long-term value of our business will be driven by partner royalties as such payments are based on global sales of potential future partner antibodies, which generally provide for larger and recurring payments as compared to technology access, research and milestone payments. While in 2022, we recognized royalty revenue from our partners’ sales of zimberelimab and sugemalimab in China, we believe our revenue will be materially driven by milestones, in the shorter term, and by royalties, in the longer term, from our partnered programs in the United States and Europe. 
Our Strategy
Our mission is to enable the rapid development of innovative therapeutics by pushing the frontiers of drug discovery technologies. We intend to achieve this mission by enabling the discovery of high-quality therapeutic candidates and by being the partner of choice for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Our strategy to accomplish this is as follows:
•Enable discovery of high-quality antibody candidates through our platform. We have a technologically differentiated platform that provides our partners with end-to-end antibody discovery capabilities, as well as customized solutions for individual steps of the antibody discovery process. We believe that pairing the power of Biological Intelligence built into our proprietary transgenic animals with our high-throughput screening technologies will continue to enable the discovery of high-quality, fully-human antibody therapeutic candidates for a wide range of indications.
•Expand upon our existing partnerships.  We have 69 active partners as of December 31, 2022, consisting of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and academic organizations, varying in size, clinical stage, geography and therapeutic focus. We intend to continue to identify and capture new opportunities with existing partners by building upon our trusted relationships. The quality and breadth of our platform enables our partners to succeed in new campaigns and has also enabled them to pursue programs that would otherwise not be pursued due to technical challenges. In addition, collaboration between our scientists and partners has expanded partners’ usage to other offerings within our technology platform, such as in silico and in vitro antibody optimization. 
•Increase the number of our partnerships.  We intend to forge new partnerships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies focused on antibody development. We plan to continue to gain new customers through increased business development activities, and through continued technological expansion. We also intend to increase the number of partnerships with smaller early-stage biotechnology companies by offering flexible deal structures and offerings. Through continual investment and expansion of our capabilities, we believe we have the opportunity to further enable our partners to capture additional value from our technologies.
•Further our technological differentiation through intelligent expansion.  We employ a methodical and deliberate approach to expanding our technology platform. Serving a broad partner base has provided us a unique insight into the needs and direction of the industry, and we continue to leverage this insight for our decision-making. In recent years, we have successfully integrated a number of technology acquisitions covering antigen generation, additional animal species, deep screening capabilities, and ion channel expertise. We intend to continue to invest in enabling technologies and evaluate strategic technology acquisitions to broaden our capabilities in the antibody discovery continuum.
•Drive partner adoption through a customizable and flexible offering.  We meet our partners’ specific needs by offering access to all or certain components of our technology platform. Some partners prefer integrated end-to-end discovery capabilities, while others prefer to use our technologies within their own labs. This flexibility not only provides value to our partners, but it allows for greater scalability of our business since we do not have to build capacity for partners that prefer to use some of their own resources in the process. This approach helps increase the partnership funnel and provides an initial forum for us to expand our relationship moving forward.
Industry Background
Antibodies: 500 Million Years of Immune System Evolution
Antibodies are blood proteins produced by the adaptive immune system in response to a specific foreign antigen. Antibodies bind to substances which the body recognizes as foreign, such as bacteria, viruses, cancer cells, and proteins in the blood. Antibodies can also be used to target cell surface proteins critical to biological functions and disease.
The immune system creates novel antibody sequences through DNA recombination involving V, D and J gene segments, followed by additional diversification mechanisms that introduce random mutations, insertions and deletions. Diversification occurs in both the heavy and light chain genes, which are translated and assembled in B cells to create the classical Y-shaped antibody. These genetic and cellular processes have the potential to create enormous diversity in natural antibody repertoires.
At any one time, the human body typically has approximately one billion different antibodies circulating in the bloodstream. Each antibody is created by one immune B cell. When an antibody expressing B cell binds to an antigen, the B cell quickly proliferates and differentiates into a family of closely related cells producing slightly differentiated antibodies. This iterative process preferentially selects antibodies that are naturally optimized to be most effective in neutralizing the specific antigen.
This process, referred to as in vivo affinity maturation, has evolved over 500 million years to naturally select antibodies that are optimized for their intended function. Antibodies discovered from natural immune systems generally have favorable therapeutic characteristics, such as high specificity, limited off-target toxicity, superior immune stimulation, and the ability to modulate half-life circulation in serum. Despite man-made technologies that try to imitate the natural selection process, over 90% of approved therapeutics are derived from natural immune systems. Our OmniAb transgenic animals take advantage of the immune system’s ability to produce high-quality antibodies, and have been genetically modified so the antibodies generated have human sequences.
The evolutionary divergence of different species has resulted in some animals developing unique mechanisms that increase their immune system effectiveness to certain antigens. Each species taps a signature combination of antigen recognition, diversification mechanisms, and distinct structural features that support survival in the face of persistent exposure to evolving environmental threats. Our four-species platform harnesses these characteristics, while maintaining the genetic sequences needed to generate diverse repertoires of high-quality, therapeutic antibodies that fit almost any discovery campaign.
Market Opportunity
According to Vaccines journal, antibodies are among the fastest growing class of drugs and are used across many therapeutic areas, including oncology, inflammation and neurodegeneration. EvaluatePharma data indicates that monoclonal antibodies have represented the majority of the top 10 bestselling drugs over the last five years. In 2022, approved antibody-based therapeutics accounted for approximately $240.0 billion in sales, according to data published by Clarivate Analytics Cortellis. In 2022, 54 antibody therapeutics reached blockbuster status with sales higher than $1.0 billion, up from 49 antibodies in 2021. Furthermore, antibody-based therapeutic sales are expected to grow to approximately $279.0 billion by 2025.
Despite advances in other therapeutic modalities, investment in antibodies has accelerated over the past decade, which has translated into clinical productivity and ultimately new drug approvals. According to data from the Antibody Society, the number of antibodies in the clinic has increased at an estimated 11% CAGR from approximately 500 in 2015 to approximately 950 in 2021. The expansion of clinical development has led to an accelerating pace of regulatory approvals as depicted in the figure below. The FDA approved the first therapeutic antibody in 1986. By 2015, the FDA approved its 50th antibody, and 6 years later in 2021, approved its 100th antibody. The number of antibody therapeutics granted a first approval in the United States or EU is shown in the graph below.
(Source: The Antibody Society Database of Antibody Regulatory Approvals, December 31, 2022)
Much of the success of antibodies as a therapeutic class is attributable to their favorable qualities relative to other therapeutic modalities. Antibodies can offer high affinity, potency and specificity, limited off-target toxicity, low immunogenicity, superior immune stimulation and the ability to modulate half-life circulation in serum. Industry statistics suggest that these properties have also translated to an increased probability of success relative to other modalities. According to PharmaIntelligence’s Clinical Development Success Rates and Contributing Factors 2011-2020, which summarizes a study of over 9,000 drugs being developed for the U.S. market, monoclonal antibodies and monoclonal antibody conjugate drugs have had an approximately 12% likelihood of receiving market authorization from the start of Phase 1 clinical trials. This is higher than the success rate of small molecule modalities, which had an approximately 8% likelihood of receiving market authorization from the start of Phase 1 clinical trials in the United States.
Existing Industry Limitations
Despite industry momentum which has resulted in an overall increase in the number of antibody therapeutic approvals per year, drug discovery and development has become increasingly fragmented, outdated and non-robust.
Reduced large pharmaceutical investment has intensified fragmentation and created ripple effects for small biotechnology companies due to reduced investment in enabling technologies. While many of these biotechnology companies bring a focused approach to science that prioritizes nimble movement and efficient decision making, their biological hypotheses are often tested utilizing suboptimal antibody discovery methods due to reliance on legacy technologies. Meanwhile, many larger companies have also continued to rely on legacy technologies for many processes related to antibody discovery, often due to the inability to selectively integrate newer technologies at their facilities or because the benefits of technological updates are limited by outdated workflows. Key examples of the frequently utilized legacy technologies and their shortcomings include:
•Humanized wild-type antibodies. This process has been utilized over the last 25 years and attempts to capture the benefits of natural antibody optimization. However, the process that converts the animal antibody into a human format introduces conformational changes that impact the desired therapeutic properties of the antibody and may cause immunogenicity concerns.
•First generation transgenics.  Earlier transgenic systems demonstrated proof-of-concept and did deliver therapeutic antibodies, however it became apparent that flaws in transgene design limited the robustness of immune responses from these animals. In addition, other technical issues, legacy agreement structures and industry consolidation presented further obstacles for the access to and use of the early platforms.
•Display technology. The commonly utilized technologies were invented over 35 years ago and do not benefit from in vivo affinity maturation and optimization. Some display libraries are engineered to capture benefits from natural immune systems, however they still carry limitations including loss of the heavy and light chain pairing, and the need for high quality soluble antigen, and they often require downstream sequence optimization for high production in a mammalian manufacturing cell line.
•Hybridoma screening. This method has been utilized for over 45 years and results in a loss of over 99% of antibody diversity, drastically reducing the pool of potential therapeutic candidates to choose from.
There is a significant and growing disparity between today’s widely used legacy antibody discovery tools and the latest advances in antibody discovery technologies. Despite the increased investment into antibody drug development, there is often a slow adoption of newer technologies due to the lack of flexibility integrating these technologies into existing workflows. These existing industry approaches are burdened with critical disadvantages including low antibody diversity, lengthy discovery timelines, limited functional parameter data, excess costs and lack of flexibility.
Our Platform
Our OmniAb technology platform is designed to enable the efficient discovery of high-quality, fully-human antibodies for a wide range of diseases. This platform aims to overcome the existing industry challenges and provides our partners access to antibody candidates based on unparalleled biological diversity that are optimized through tight integration across a full range of discovery technologies. These technologies include computationally powered antigen design, transgenic animals, high-throughput microcapillary single-cell analysis, next-generation sequencing, proprietary assays and bioinformatics. We believe that by providing our partners with access to these technologies we will ultimately shorten the discovery timelines, reduce costs, and increase the probability of success.
Our investments in our technologies are methodical and deliberate, with the goal to continue to provide our partners with the most cutting-edge technologies to solve the biggest challenges in antibody discovery. Our technologies are modular and sequential, creating a complete and scalable solution. These technologies also can be individually integrated into our partners internal or external workflows, which allows us to provide our partners with both integrated end-to-end discovery solutions and highly customizable, program-by-program offerings, which address critical industry challenges and provide our partners with optimized antibody discovery solutions. Our technology platform is a suite of integrated technologies designed to discover a wide range of high-quality therapeutic antibodies that leverage the inherent diversity produced by transgenic animals and high throughput single-cell screening, as described below.
Create Diverse Antibody Repertoires
We believe generating large and diverse repertoires of high-quality antibodies increases the chances of discovering the antibody with the most desirable therapeutic characteristics. We have assembled a suite of transgenic animal and antigen technologies that are designed to generate a large and diverse pool of high-quality antibodies. The heart of the OmniAb technology platform is the Biological Intelligence of our proprietary transgenic animals, including OmniRat, OmniMouse, and OmniChicken, that have been genetically modified to generate antibodies with human sequences which are naturally optimized through in vivo affinity maturation. We combine our transgenic animals with proprietary antigen technology and immunization techniques to generate high-quality antibodies for even the most difficult biological challenges. The various OmniAb animal technologies are depicted in the figure below.
We believe that natural antibodies are superior to other antibody generation methods due to the immune system’s ability to naturally select quality, and already optimized antibodies through a process that has evolved over 500 million years. According to the Antibody Society Database of Antibody Regulatory Approvals, as of December 30, 2022, over 90% of all approved antibody drugs had been derived from natural immune systems, which we believe is due to their superior drug-like properties. The evolutionary divergence of different species has resulted in some animals developing unique mechanisms that increase their immune system effectiveness to certain antigens. Our engineered animal platforms harness these characteristics, while maintaining the human genetic sequences needed to generate diverse repertoires of high-quality, fully-human therapeutic antibodies that fit almost any discovery campaign.
Our team of world-renowned scientists use a variety of gene editing techniques to alter the genomes of animals to produce antibodies that use human sequences, while retaining the animal’s ability to illicit a strong immune response to antigen. We then set up breeding colonies of our genetically modified animals for use in partners’ discovery efforts. While there are several options when considering transgenic mice, OmniAb is the only four-species platform, with the world’s only transgenic mouse, rat, chicken, and cow antibody humanization technology. Each animal has unique characteristics which address key challenges in antibody discovery.
We pair our animal technologies with antigen design to further enhance the robust antibody repertoires for antibody campaigns. We offer antigen design technology, which we own or exclusively license, for production of challenging therapeutic targets. Most drug targets are membrane proteins which are inherently unstable and challenging to investigate. The technology produces full-length membrane proteins, including multi-Tm proteins, such as ion channels and GPCRs, the largest class of therapeutic drug targets. Our antigen production works in tandem with our therapeutic antibody discovery platform, providing access to high-quality membrane protein antigens for immunization campaigns. Guided by molecular modeling and protein design capabilities, our antigen design team manages the cloning, expression, purification, reconstitution, and quality control of purified native-conformation membrane proteins for immunization and screening purposes. Antigens can be prepared in particular conformations with protein or small molecule conformational chaperones. The range of accessible antigen formats improves the probability of success in generating robust immune response with desired specificities from any of the OmniAb animals.
Collectively, we believe our transgenic animal and antigen technologies provide the foundation for a successful drug discovery campaign.
Screen Antibody Candidates
Finding the best antibody means finding the best antibody producing cell. Each antibody is made by an antibody producing cell, known as a B cell, that contains the genetic sequence that encodes its unique antibody. When presented with an antigen, the immune system will respond by creating millions of different antibodies and preferentially selecting antibodies that best neutralize the perceived threat. These large antibody repertoires can present a challenge in identifying the antibodies with the most optimal candidate drug profiles from millions of possibilities.
In addition to the enormous number of different antibodies generated, individual B cells are microscopic, generate only a miniscule amount of antibody protein, and are difficult to grow in culture conditions. The amount of antibody produced by an individual B cell is too small to be tested directly in conventional 96-well plates. Because of this, scientists have relied on the hybridoma method for antibody discovery for the past 45 years. During this process, B cells are fused with a certain type of cancer cell, which immortalizes the B cells allowing them to be grown into sufficient quantities for the antibodies to be tested in conventional 96-well plates. This process takes approximately 8 to 12 weeks, and is extremely inefficient, leading to losses of 99.9% of the relevant immune diversity from the beginning of the process. Despite these significant limitations, hybridoma remains a commonly used technology in the industry.
We analyze B cells individually using microcapillaries and industry leading throughput with our proprietary xPloration and GEM platforms. The xPloration platform is an AI-powered single-cell microcapillary platform that provides multi-dimensional profiling data on tens of millions of cells. Our proprietary technology uses a chip with 1.5 million microscopic capillaries that are loaded with individual secreting B cells. Chips are processed through automated imaging, then AI-powered algorithms analyze and identify thousands of B cells that express antibodies with the desired characteristics. Our AI algorithms are empowered by the industry leading LandingLensTM platform developed by Landing AI. Using technology we own or license from Stanford University, thousands of AI-selected B cells are recovered within minutes using lasers that break the capillary forces and drop the B cell into wells for sequencing. The whole process can screen up to 40 million cells and recover thousands of paired sequences all within a few hours.
We believe the xPloration platform represents industry-leading screening and cell recovery. The screening throughput enables the discovery of rare cells that would be missed with other systems that only evaluate a small sliver of the repertoire.
Identify the Right Antibody
Both xPloration and GEM identify potentially thousands of therapeutic antibody candidates which must then be narrowed to a small number of lead candidates. Our OmniAb team is flexibly positioned to work directly with partners to develop work plans and screening cascades that are customized to their antibody design specifications. We also assist our partners in their own downstream activities to ultimately find the right antibody for further development. Paired chains are cloned in high throughput and expressed as recombinant antibodies in a variety of format options for confirmation and further characterization. Assays include high throughput epitope binning and kinetics analysis, and target-specific functional assays. Functional data combined with the large amounts of data generated from xPloration provide a comprehensive view of the immune response and allow our partners to select antibodies with even the most stringent design criteria.
Often the right antibody must be further modified to enhance certain desired characteristics in a process known as antibody optimization. Introducing changes to the DNA sequence that enhance one characteristic, can be detrimental to others. This results in a process that is lengthy, costly, and reliant on trial-and-error experimentation. We believe many of these challenges are averted by using natural immune systems that have evolved over 500 million years to naturally select antibodies that are optimized for their intended function. Our antibody repertoires are large, diverse, and full of high-quality antibodies that provide our partners with a significant number of fully optimized leads. In the most challenging discovery programs, our team can provide hit expansion through xPloration deep dives and/or NGS data mining to identify variants of confirmed clones with improved affinity, improved manufacturability, or other favorable characteristics, while avoiding the time and technical risk associated with traditional optimization methods.
In situations where characteristics need to be improved beyond what is available in the repertoire, we can filter sequence variants through a battery of in silico evaluations to remove sequences with liabilities or potential developability problems, and potentially improve potency. Optimized sequences are then re-expressed in antibody format of choice and performance is further evaluated in analytical and bioassay evaluation to create a ranked list of potential leads.
Our Partnership Business Model
We partner with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic institutions that vary in size, clinical stage, geography and therapeutic focus. Our partners have access to wide repertoires of antibodies and state-of-the-art screening technologies designed to enable efficient discovery of next-generation novel therapeutics and deliver high-quality therapeutic antibody candidates for a wide range of diseases. Our partners can select a target and define the antibody properties needed for therapeutic development or use certain of our technologies directly in their own laboratories. To the extent our partners request us to provide additional discovery work beyond screening, we capture additional fees either in terms of upfront payments or downstream via additional milestones or royalties.
Our license agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners typically include: (i) upfront or annual payments for technology access and payments for performance of research services; (ii) downstream payments in the form of preclinical, intellectual property, clinical, regulatory, and commercial milestones; and (iii) royalties on net sales of our partners’ products, if any. License agreements with academic institutions are typically structured as revenue sharing. We succeed when our partners are successful and our agreements are structured to align economic and scientific interests. Our license agreements typically include annual reporting requirements which provide us updates from our partners on the status of their programs. In addition, we track our active partnered programs by reviewing our partners’ public announcements and maintaining close communications with our partners to the extent possible. In some instances, a partner may not publicly announce milestones in which case we are generally dependent on our partners to track and disclose milestones at the time of achievement. Our license agreements are typically terminable by our partners without penalty with specified notice. However, all milestone payments and royalties survive termination and continue with respect to any OmniAb-derived antibodies. The royalty term is typically the longer of 10 years from the first commercial sale or through the last expiration in any jurisdiction of the patents covering such OmniAb-derived antibody. Importantly, our royalty term is linked to the patents that our partners file, which both lengthens and diversifies the royalty streams we receive. Our typical royalty rates for antibody discovery contracts are currently in the low- to mid-single digits, and can vary depending on other economic terms in the agreement. Although our license agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners typically include technology access fees, milestone payments and royalties, each agreement is negotiated separately and as a result, the financial terms and contractual provisions vary from agreement to agreement. By providing a full suite of antibody discovery technologies with streamlined economics, we believe we offer an attractive option to industry stakeholders.
The below graph shows the growth in active partners, active programs and clinical programs and the number of programs that have entered clinical trials. As of December 31, 2022, there were 291 active antibody programs. An active program is counted once research work has commenced or an antigen is introduced into our animals and includes active clinical programs and approved products. An active partner is one that has an active program or has executed a license agreement in advance of initiating an active program. Active clinical programs represents the number of unique programs for which an IND or equivalent under other regulatory regimes has been filed based on an OmniAb-derived antibody and which are in clinical development. Approved products represents an OmniAb-derived antibody for which our partner has received marketing approval. 
Our partners’ active clinical programs include monoclonal and bispecific antibodies discovered using OmniRat, OmniMouse, OmniFlic, or OmniChicken and target a range of therapeutic indications including oncology, immunology, and metabolic disorders. As our partners’ discovery and preclinical programs continue to mature, we expect the number of OmniAb-derived antibodies in clinical development by our partners to expand to include antibodies discovered using our newer OmniClic and OmniTaur technologies.
Our Technology
The foundational technologies that power our OmniAb Technology Platform are described below:
OmniRat
OmniRat was launched in 2012 and is the first example of a successful knock-out of the endogenous rat immunoglobulin genes coupled with transgenesis of human counterparts. OmniRat produces a diverse repertoire of antibodies with human idiotypes and immunological characteristics that are comparable to antibodies from wildtype animals. OmniRat provides cross-reactivity against a mouse, which may streamline preclinical development by obviating the need for surrogate antibodies, and thereby may decrease clinical risks. The OmniRat has been engineered to contain functional recombinant immunoglobulin loci, use genes with similar frequency as humans, and rearrange functional human immunoglobulin genes. The animals are bred on a mixed genetic background to further diversify the antibody repertoire and feature different light chain isotypes which is designed to provide flexibility around partners’ needs and technology. The OmniRat shows high expression, normal human CDR-H3 length distribution, and normal hypermutation and affinity maturation. As of December 31, 2022, there are three approved OmniRat-derived antibodies and 18 additional antibodies in clinical development by our partners.
OmniMouse
OmniMouse was launched in 2014, and we designed this technology using the same transgenes as OmniRat to deliver fully human antibodies utilizing standard mouse-based protocols. OmniMouse expands the sequence diversity of our rat-based platforms (OmniRat and OmniFlic), offering easy conversion from wildtype mice while utilizing the same protocols. OmniMouse produces a diverse repertoire of antibodies with human idiotypes and provides a complementary murine system for additional sequence diversity. Like OmniRat, OmniMouse is currently bred to generate a mixed genetic background to further increase sequence diversity. For partners who prefer to work with mice, OmniMouse provides a rapid solution to deliver fully-human antibodies. As of December 31, 2022, there is one OmniMouse-derived antibody in clinical development by our partners.
OmniChicken
OmniChicken was launched in 2016 and is the first successfully engineered bird with an immune system that can efficiently generate human sequence antibody repertoires for the discovery of therapeutic antibodies. OmniChicken and OmniClic, our bispecific transgenic chicken platform, offer affinity matured antibodies in an evolutionarily distant chicken host environment. As depicted in the figure below, more than 300 million years of evolutionary distance drives divergence between mammalian and avian orthologs, which are genes in different species that evolved from a common ancestral gene by speciation. This evolutionary distance enables generation of a diverse repertoire of antibody panels to highly conserved therapeutic target antigens that are not immunogenic in mammals.
OmniChicken features a high level of functional diversity, with sequence diversity focused on the CDR regions, while maintaining conserved, well-validated human framework regions. OmniChicken antibodies bind to diverse epitopes on human targets with high affinity, and additionally offer excellent developability profiles. As of December 31, 2022, there is one OmniChicken-derived antibody in clinical development by our partners.
OmniTaur
OmniTaur was launched in 2020 and provides cow-derived ultralong CDR-H3 antibodies with a human framework. CDR-H3 is the region of the antibody that makes primary contact with the target and ultralong CDR-H3 antibodies have been shown to bind to targets with deep or cryptic epitopes. We believe these antibodies could be leveraged for a variety of targets with epitopes which may be difficult to reach with conventional antibodies, including ion channels, transporters, and viral proteins. As depicted in the figure below, OmniTaur features a fully human variable framework, and an ultralong CDR-H3 region, which we believe makes OmniTaur antibodies well suited for targeting unique, disease-relevant epitopes. 
OmniChicken with cow-inspired properties (in development)
We are currently developing a next generation OmniChicken with cow-inspired CDR-H3 motifs. If successful, this will combine the OmniChicken’s ability to generate antibodies against highly conserved targets with the structural attributes of OmniTaur’s ultralong CDR-H3 domains. We believe these combined benefits may enable antibody discovery for a number of high-value targets that are undruggable with today’s technologies.
Bispecific antibody platforms
We offer the only rat and chicken platform for generation of bispecific antibodies. Although bispecific antibody drugs have been researched for more than 30 years, only a limited number of bispecific antibodies have achieved regulatory approval. There are very few successful examples of large-scale manufacturing for a bispecific antibody, and the “common light chain format” is a technology designed to simplify and improve the efficiency of the production and purification of a whole IgG—type bispecific antibody. Our bispecific antibodies are IgG antibodies, with a common light chain and different heavy chains. Common light chain antibodies allow for combining targeting arms for bispecific and multi-specific antibodies without the complexity of correct heavy and light chain pairing. Using this IgG format, the bispecific function can be introduced while maintaining the natural shape of the antibody. Both OmniFlic, our bispecific rat, and OmniClic, our bispecific chicken, express the same light chain which enables the formation of bispecific therapeutics through the combination of antibodies generated from either platform.
We believe that the characteristics of our common light chain platforms offer several advantages over current generation bispecific antibody technologies. To generate bispecific antibodies, we conduct parallel immunizations with two antigens and then engineer the two targeting arms of the antibody as depicted in the figure below. We then use functional screening to identify heavy chain pairs with balanced affinities for their targets and support robust purification of the bispecific antibodies for manufacturing purposes.
OmniFlic (Bispecific rat platform)
OmniFlic was launched in 2014 and is a fixed light-chain variation of OmniRat. The OmniFlic transgenic rat expresses a fixed VK3-15 light chain. OmniFlic features the same heavy chain transgene as OmniRat, which generates diverse repertoires upon immunization. OmniFlic is a fixed light-chain transgenic rat developed to facilitate the generation of bispecific antibodies. As of December 31, 2022, there are three OmniFlic-derived antibodies in clinical development by our partners.
OmniClic (Bispecific chicken platform)
OmniClic was launched in 2019 and is a common light-chain transgenic chicken developed to facilitate the generation of bispecific antibodies. OmniClic was engineered to focus sequence diversity on the CDRs of the VH domain. OmniClic expresses the VH3-23 and VK3-15 light chains, with a modified light chain transgene to minimize diversification.
Our bispecific antibody platforms produce IgG, antibodies, with a common light chain and different heavy chains. To generate these antibodies, we conduct parallel immunizations with two antigens and then engineer a bespoke version of the transgenic platform to generate a diverse set of heavy chains and ultimately bispecific therapeutic antibodies.
HCO/OmnidAb™ chicken
OmniAb scientists recently developed a next generation OmniChicken designed to express antibodies comprised of heavy chains, that do not require pairing with light chains, unlike conventional IgG heavy chains. Such antibodies are referred to as domain antibodies (“dAbs”) or as heavy chain only (“HCO”) antibodies. In addition to other unique benefits and uses, HCO antibodies, similar to common light chain antibodies, can be used to generate bispecific and multispecific antibodies while avoiding the complexity of correct heavy and light chain pairing. HCO antibodies resemble camelid antibodies, which are smaller than conventional antibodies, allowing for the targeting of novel epitopes. We expect OmnidAb to be available to partners by December 2023.
Screening Technologies
We believe that the xPloration platform offers greatly improved screening and cell recovery compared to other leading, commercially available single-cell multi-dimensional profiling technologies. The xPloration screening throughput is designed to enable the discovery of rare cells that would likely be missed with other systems that are only able to evaluate a small sliver of the repertoire. We pair this with next-generation sequencing to further expand the repertoire for potential hit expansion downstream if necessary. Our laser-based recovery process retains heavy/light chain pairing of the antibodies, which directly provides potential lead antibody sequences bypassing the need for pairing algorithms that attempt to reconstruct the repertoire. The considerable throughput combined with retaining heavy/light chain antibody pairing can cut weeks or months off traditional discovery workflows.
For certain development programs, we leverage our proprietary GEM technology. The GEM technology incorporates many of the same principles of the xPloration platform by isolating and performing multi-dimensional profiling of single B cells from an immunized animal. Small droplets encapsulate single B cells and reporters that present the target antigen on the surface of a bead or cell. Secreted antibodies from the B cell diffuse locally in the microenvironment where they can bind to Reporters, which in turn can be detected with a fluorescent probe. Using different types of Reporters in the microenvironment can generate a multi-parameter binding profile of each antibody. Antigen specificity is determined by colocalization of signal with alternative bead and/or cell types. Millions of GEMs can be examined in parallel. GEMs containing B cells and antibodies of interest can be harvested, cloned, and expressed as recombinant antibodies for further characterization studies.
Both xPloration and GEM are compatible with a wide variety of assay formats, including cell surface binding assays, reporter cell stimulation, multiplex target binding, and cross-reactivity screening. These assays enable us to tackle high value, challenging targets, such as ion channels and GPCRs. High throughput B cell screening is particularly valuable within the OmniAb ecosystem because of our unique animal offerings. While mouse hybridoma techniques have been available for decades, hybridoma generation methods for other species including chickens, and cows are not available. As such, B cell screening with OmniAb’s platforms enables the discovery of unique antibodies from any host systems.
Next generation xPloration (in development)
OmniAb scientists and engineers are currently developing a next generation xPloration platform as depicted in the figure below. We believe this platform has the potential to further expand our position as the industry leader in speed, throughput, reliability, and ease of use. 
Ion Channel Differentiated Capabilities
Ion channels and transporters are key components in a wide variety of biological processes that involve rapid changes in cells and have broad therapeutic applicability across multiple therapeutic areas including oncology, metabolic disease, pain, neurological diseases, infectious diseases and others. Ion channels make particularly challenging drug targets due to (i) difficulty with antigen purification (ii) poor immunogenicity (iii) high homology with rodents used in immunization campaigns and (iv) small binding regions with the majority of protein embedded in cell membranes.
Due to these challenges in developing effective therapeutics, patients suffering from ion channel and transporter related diseases are severely underserved. Icagen® has extensive biological capabilities focused on ion channels and transporters, and decades of experience in novel drug discovery from screening to lead optimization, with an active set of big pharma discovery and asset-based partnerships. The differentiated core capabilities at Icagen can provide novel reagent generation and proprietary assays that can also support antibody discovery programs and can be accessed by partners when pursuing ion channels and transporter targets. We believe we are well positioned to provide the tools necessary to generate and discover antibodies and small molecules to target ion channel and transporter targets. Our computational antigen generation technology has been validated in successfully generating, stabilizing, and purifying antigen for these targets and our four-species transgenic animal platform is validated in successfully generating antibodies for poorly immunogenic, high homology, and cryptic targets.
In addition to the drug design challenges, it is difficult to develop effective functional assays to test potential therapeutics. OmniAb’s proprietary Icagen ion channel platform leverages proprietary expertise in the combination of biological assays, medicinal chemistry, and in silico and computational chemistry applications to enable the discovery of ion channel targeting therapeutics. We believe this suite of technologies provides a differentiated capability for advancing high value ion channel and transporter drug discovery programs regardless of modality including small molecules, mono-, bi-and multi-specific antibodies, and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs).

Competition
The market for technologies that enable the discovery and development of therapeutic antibodies, such as ours, is global, characterized by intense competition and subject to significant intellectual property barriers. The solutions and applications offered by our competitors vary in size, breadth and scope, and given the broad promise of antibody therapeutics, we face competition from many different sources, including companies developing single-cell screening technologies, transgenic animals and antibody engineering technologies, using a variety of business models, including the development of internal pipelines of therapeutics, financial investment in partner programs, technology licensing, and the sale of instruments and devices. We also face competition from companies who use internal resources and technologies for their discovery capabilities, as well as integrated contract research organizations that use traditional hybridoma, phage, and yeast display technologies in discovery. Due to the significant interest and growth in antibody therapeutics more broadly, we expect the intensity of this competition to increase.
We seek to provide our partners with the most advanced technologies for antibody drug discovery, including antigen design, transgenic animal platforms and single-cell analysis. Many emerging and established life sciences companies have been built around technologies that focus on one or a limited number of these steps. Examples include:
•in discovery using genetically engineered rodents, we face technical competition from companies that provide access to similar technologies, such as AbCellera Biologics Inc., Ablexis LLC, Alloy Therapeutics, Inc. Crescendo Biologics Ltd., Harbour Antibodies BV, Leveragen, Inc., Merus N.V., Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and RenBio Inc.;
•in the field of single-cell screening, we face technical competition from companies that provide access to similar technologies, such as AbCellera Biologics Inc., Berkeley Lights Inc., HiFiBio Inc., and Sphere Fluidics Ltd.; and
•in ion channel drug discovery, we face technical competition from companies that provide similar technologies, or biological expertise, such as Charles River Labs Inc., Evotec SE, Metrion Biosciences Ltd., and WuXi AppTec.
We also face direct business competition from companies that provide antibody discovery services using technologies, such as hybridoma and display. Companies with discovery business models that include downstream payments include AbCellera Biologics Inc. and Adimab LLC. In addition, we compete with a variety of fee-for-service contract research organizations that provide services, in most cases using legacy technologies, that compete with one or more steps in our technology platform.
For a discussion of the risks we face relating to competition, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—The life sciences and biotech platform technology market is highly competitive, and if we cannot compete successfully with our competitors, we may be unable to increase or sustain our revenue, or sustain profitability.”

Government Regulation
Regulation of Drugs and Biological Products and Coverage and Reimbursement
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in the European Union (“EU”) and other countries and jurisdictions, extensively regulate, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, safety, effectiveness, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drugs and biological products such as those that our partners develop. Our partners must obtain the requisite approvals from the applicable regulatory authority prior to the commencement of clinical studies. In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and biologics under the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act. In the EU, the European Commission and national competent authorities of the EU member states regulate the development and marketing of medicinal products, including biologics. Prior to obtaining approval to commercialize a therapeutic candidate in the United States, EU or otherwise abroad, our partners must demonstrate with substantial evidence from well-controlled non-clinical studies and clinical trials, and to the satisfaction of the FDA, European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) or comparable foreign regulatory agencies, that such drugs are safe and effective, or in the case of biologics in the United States, safe, pure, and potent, for their intended use. FDA approval of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) or Biologics License Application (“BLA”) or supplement, or European Commission or national competent authority of an EU member state granting of a marketing authorization (“MA”) in the EU, is required before any new drug or biologic can be marketed. If we or our partners fail to comply with applicable laws or regulations at any time, we or our partners may become subject to sanctions or other legal consequences, including among other things, delays in 
developing therapeutics, restrictions on marketing or manufacturing, withdrawal of products, product recalls, or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. In addition we and our partners are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement under laws related to, among other things, state, federal and foreign anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, and transparency laws and regulations related to drug pricing and payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare providers. 
Sales of therapeutics will depend substantially, both domestically and internationally, on the extent to which the costs of such therapeutics are paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other third-party payors. Further, in the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been the subject of major legislative initiatives that may affect the ability to profitably commercialize drugs, and similar developments in the EU may occur. For example, in August 2022 the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was signed into law and, among other things, it requires: manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare (beginning in 2026); imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023); and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025). 
FDA Regulation of Intentionally Genetically Altered Animals 
The FDCA provides the FDA with authority to regulate as a drug intentionally genetically altered (“IGA”) animals, including where such animals are intended to produce human drugs. In general, any new animal drug is deemed unsafe and adulterated unless FDA has approved a new animal drug application (“NADA”) for its intended use, or unless such drug is only for investigational use and conforms to specified exemptions for such use under an Investigational New Animal Drug (“INAD”) exemption. However, although IGA animals may be subject to premarket approval requirements or the requirement for an INAD when used in research and development, in some circumstances the FDA has not required INADs or NADAs for such IGA animals. For example, in a draft guidance issued in January 2017, the FDA stated its intention to exercise enforcement discretion in a risk-based manner with regard to INAD and NADA requirements for certain IGA animals that are nonfood-producing species, taking into consideration the relative human, animal and environmental risks posed by such animals. The FDA has also stated it may modify its approach with respect to INAD or NADA requirements for other kinds or uses of animals based on its evaluation of risks. Failure to comply with applicable requirements may subject a company to FDA enforcement action, as noted above.
Data Privacy & Security
Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, regulations, and standards govern the collection, use, access to, confidentiality and security of health-related and other personal information, including clinical trial data, and could apply now or in the future to our operations or the operations of our partners. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
For a discussion of the risks associated with government regulations applicable to us and our partners, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” elsewhere in this Annual Report.

Corporate History and Background
We were initially incorporated as Avista Public Acquisition Corp. II (“APAC”), an exempted company in the Cayman Islands, on February 5, 2021. On October 31, 2022, APAC deregistered in the Cayman Islands and was domesticated as a corporation under the State of Delaware, and in connection with which APAC changed its name to “OmniAb, Inc.”.
On November 1, 2022 (the “Closing Date”), in accordance with the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, dated as of March 23, 2022 (the “Separation Agreement”), among APAC, Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (“Ligand”), OmniAb Operations, Inc. (formerly known as OmniAb, Inc.) (“Legacy OmniAb”), Ligand transferred the Legacy OmniAb business, including certain related subsidiaries of Ligand, to Legacy OmniAb and made a contribution to the capital of Legacy OmniAb (the “Separation”).
