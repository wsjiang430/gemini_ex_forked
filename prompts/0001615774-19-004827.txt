Overview
 
SenesTech, Inc. (referred to in this report as “SenesTech,” the “Company,” “we” or “us”) was formed in July 2004 and incorporated in the state of Nevada. The Company subsequently reincorporated in the state of Delaware in November 2015. Our corporate headquarters is in Flagstaff, Arizona. We have developed and are commercializing a global, proprietary technology for managing animal pest populations, initially rat populations, through fertility control.
 
Although a myriad of tools are available to fight rat infestations, communities continue to face challenges in controlling today’s infestations. Infestations result in incredible infrastructure damage, as well as pose additional risks to the health and food security of communities. In addition to these challenges, the pest management industry and Pest Management Professionals (PMPs) are being increasingly asked for new solutions to help solve the problem. With growing concerns about rat resistance to rodenticides and a growing interest in non-lethal options, it is becoming increasingly important for PMPs to have new tools at their disposal. Our goal is to provide customers with not only a solution to combat their most difficult infestations, but also offer a non-lethal option to serve customers that are looking to decrease or remove the amount of poison used in their pest management programs.
 
Our first fertility control product, ContraPest, is a liquid bait containing the active ingredients 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD) and triptolide. When consumed, ContraPest targets reproduction, limiting fertility in male and female rats beginning with the first breeding cycle following consumption. ContraPest is being marketed for use in controlling rat populations, specifically Norway and roof rats. On August 23, 2015, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) granted registration approval for ContraPest as a Restricted Product Due to Professional Expertise (referred to in this report as a “Restricted Use designation”), effective August 2, 2016. On October 18, 2018, the EPA approved the removal of the Restricted Use designation. We believe ContraPest is the first and only non-lethal, fertility control product approved by the EPA for the management of rodent populations.
 
In addition to the EPA registration of ContraPest in the U.S., we must obtain registration from the various state regulatory agencies prior to selling in each state. As of the date of this report, we have received registration for ContraPest in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, 23 of which have approved the removal of the Restricted Use designation.
 
We expect to continue to pursue regulatory approvals and amendments to existing registration in the United States for ContraPest, and if ContraPest begins to generate sufficient revenue, regulatory approvals for any additional jurisdictions beyond the United States. The Company also continues to develop other potential additional fertility control and animal health products for additional species.
 
Current Challenges in Pest Control Methodologies
 
Despite current pest control methodologies, ranging from sanitation and physical approaches to biological and chemical approaches, rat infestations continue to be a significant problem. While deploying these methodologies can lead to an initial decrease in rat populations, rat infestations persist. As these infestations persist, so does the damage associated with them. Rodents cause significant damage to public infrastructure by undermining foundations with burrowing and by gnawing on electrical wiring and insulation, fireproofing systems and electronic and computer equipment. Rats also pose additional risks to the health and food security of communities.
 
While lethal poisons have been at the forefront of pest management programs to curb these infestations and the associated damage, they have not provided consistent, sustained results. This is because rats reproduce at an extremely rapid rate. This rapid rate of reproduction can be seen in the “population rebound” that typically follows the initial decline in rodent populations that are exposed to lethal poisons. After the initial decline in the infestation, surviving rodents have plentiful food and harborage creating conditions in which rats can quickly reproduce. A single pair of rats in the wild can, under ideal breeding conditions, contribute over 15,000 progenies in their expected lifespan of 8-12 months. This means that PMPs typically need to visit a site often to combat not only the initial infestation, but also subsequent “rebounds.”
 
Additionally, studies have shown that rodents will generally not consume food that they have seen adversely affect other rodents, which is referred to as “bait shyness.” When the adverse effects of lethal products are displayed by rodents, other rodents in the vicinity typically avoid the areas where these poisons were located. Finally, there is the potential that rats may develop a resistance to certain lethal rodenticides, further contributing to a potential failure of existing pest management approaches. Widespread resistance to rodenticides has been identified as a problem in Europe, and recent research indicates this may be an emerging issue in the U.S. as well. This requires property owners and PMPs to continuously apply, on a rotating basis, rodenticides that vary in active ingredients and formulations in an effort to control these populations without favoring resistance to a particular poison.

Integrated Pest Management and Fertility Control
 
The most effective, long-term way to manage rodents is by using a combination of tools that work together to magnify the efficacy of the pest management protocol. Integrated pest management is based upon this concept. Regulatory agencies and industry experts recognize that fertility control is or can be an essential component of safe and sustainable integrated pest management.
 
ContraPest is an innovative technology with an approach that targets the reproductive capabilities of both sexes in rat populations, inducing egg loss in female rats and impairing sperm development in males. Our proprietary formulation addresses key biological traits of rats, making it a more targeted solution. Targeting both males and females allows us to drive populations down and to sustain that population reduction. Its efficacy has been demonstrated in numerous internal and third-party studies.
 
Using a proprietary bait delivery method, ContraPest is dispensed in a highly palatable liquid formulation that promotes sustained consumption by rat communities, helping keep populations down. Rats require 10% of their body weight in water per day, making Contrapest an attractive bait to add to pest management programs. The high fat content and sweet taste leads to repeat consumption even among sought after food sources. In both field and laboratory settings, ContraPest was chosen by rats even in the presence of abundant water sources and plentiful food options including animal feed, trash, and other options. Consumption of ContraPest does not cause illness in rats and therefore it does not change behavior or result in “bait shyness,”
 
Adding ContraPest to an integrated pest management program allows PMPs to bring the populations down and keep them at a more manageable level by preventing reproduction and therefore limiting population rebounds. Knowing the populations are lower should allow PMPs to be more focused on preventing future invasions and maintenance instead of continually needing to respond to population spikes. ContraPest’s delivery system is designed to minimize handler exposure and is dispensed inside tamper-resistant bait stations, minimizing risks to handlers and non-target species.
 
We believe ContraPest can establish a new paradigm in rodent control, allowing for a decreased reliance on poisons through the offering of a stand-alone non-lethal option, where requested by the customer or required by circumstances.
 
ContraPest is a versatile tool that can be used as a standalone non-lethal solution or within integrated pest management program to help reduce reproduction and magnify the success of integrated infestation control methodologies.
 


Approved for use in indoor, non-food areas, and outdoors within one foot of a man-made structure, ContraPest gives PMPs an integral tool that can be deployed to fight rat infestations in a variety of settings. This is particularly important given that infested areas may include a diverse set of variables. ContraPest is currently dispensed from a tank and tray, housed inside a tamper resistant bait station.
 
Other Applications
 
We have also begun exploring diverse applications with a variety of collaborators. We have conducted proof of concept studies with feral dogs on the Navajo Reservation in New Mexico with a grant from the USDA, and we have collected rabies and geographic data on stray dogs in the Tibetan refugee camps of Mainpat, India. We completed a collaboration with Texas A&M University in June 2016 to test the potential of our product candidates to manage feral pigs. Studies have also been conducted for proof of concept in Australia with wallaby, rat, and mouse populations and in New Zealand with rats and brushtail possums. We have also conducted early trials with cats in collaboration with the University of Florida.
 
These diverse studies seek to provide evidence of the potential for ContraPest and the continued development of fertility control technology in general.

Business Strategy 
 
Our goal is to become a leader in fertility control technology designed to limit the adverse effects of rodent infestations, including infrastructure damage and risks to our communities’ health and food security. Key elements of our strategy are:

● | Work to maximize market acceptance for, and generate sales of, our products;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Manage the infrastructure for sales, marketing and distribution of ContraPest and any other product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Seek additional regulatory approvals for ContraPest and, to the extent we believe there is commercial viability, our other product candidates; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Further develop our manufacturing processes to contain costs while being able to scale to meet future demand of ContraPest and any other product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continue product development of ContraPest and advance our research and development activities and, as our operating budget permits, advance the research and development programs for other product candidates;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and commercialization efforts and operations as a public company.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Manufacturing, Marketing and Distribution
 
Commercialization Plans
 


We began to fully commercialize ContraPest and to generate revenue from the sale of ContraPest in the second quarter of 2018. Our target market segments for ContraPest include structural accounts (multi-family housing); national retailers; zoos and animal sanctuaries; food production and agriculture (e.g., meat packing facilities, dairy production plants, vegetable and fruit preparation facilities farms, storage facilities and protein production facilities (including cattle, sheep, pig and poultry facilities)); hospitality and theme parks (e.g., major restaurant chains and hotels) and municipalities (e.g., subways, transit systems and public housing agencies).

We market ContraPest both to pest management companies and directly to target segments, using a direct PMP sales channel, indirectly through distributor sales, and a direct sales force to targeted customer segments. In addition, we have been pursuing strategic relationships with large pest management companies and affinity groups for the distribution and sale of ContraPest.
 
Sales Approach 
 
In the U.S., ContraPest is most commonly deployed and serviced by a licensed PMP, although some customers have in house pest management service personnel. In some circumstances, customers of pest management services will direct these PMPs to use certain products in the provision of their service.
 
Many of our potential customers purchase their products through a network of distributors. The advantages to us of selling through such distributors include:
 

● | Immediate availability of a field sales force experienced in selling rodent control products; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Familiarity with our target customers and the challenges they face; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our field personnel, customer service, accounts receivable, and shipping and handling teams can be smaller, thus reducing fixed operational costs; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Less need to substantially expand the sales force as our product gains traction with new customers. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Because of the unique nature of our technology, pest management companies generally have an interest in learning more about ContraPest. Consequently, we plan to continue to foster these discussions, to exchange data, and to negotiate agreements with carefully selected partners to maximize the appropriate deployment of our product.
 
We plan to be deeply involved in the initial deployment of ContraPest and assist with in-depth product training, business development, and the creation of sales and marketing tools.
 
Third-Party Arrangements
 
As a result of our sales approach and target markets, we are party to the following arrangements:
 
Distribution – In the U.S., ContraPest is primarily deployed and serviced by licensed PMPs. These PMPs typically purchase their supplies through distributors. Accordingly, we have agreements with seven distributors, and intend to add additional distributors from time to time. We also have the ability to sell directly to large pest control companies or other entities that provide in-house pest control.
 
Subject to obtaining necessary regulatory approvals, we plan to market ContraPest in additional international jurisdictions, including Europe. Our expectation is that we will stage these market launches after gaining further success in the United States or we find partners to finance the cost of the regulatory approval process and launches. However, we have not yet entered into any binding agreements related to these matters.
 
Pricing and Value
 
Our pricing strategy takes into account the cost of goods sold, the cost of competitive products and the value of our product to the end user. We believe ContraPest will be perceived as a significant value as a complement to existing pest control products or as a non-lethal stand-alone solution for managing rat infestations and, as such, should command a premium price. Our experience is that potential customers understand the advantages of ContraPest and become enthusiastic about its use. We plan to continue to use promotional efforts to support the value message and to justify our product’s premium price, built around the following proposed advantages:

● | ContraPest as a proven technology with: ● A targeted delivery for maximum efficacy; ● A proprietary gravity feeding system that optimizes consumption. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ContraPest can be used as an anchor for an integrated pest management program, or as a stand-alone solution to decrease reliance on poisons or other lethal options.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ContraPest is designed, formulated and dispensed to be low hazard for handlers and non-targeted species such as wildlife, livestock and pets.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We also focus on specific advantages for the individual customer and expect to position our product as having the following additional general advantages:
 

● | Savings by reducing loss or contamination of food inventories; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Savings by reducing damage to infrastructure; 


● | Creation of a more predictable cost model based on prevention vs. treatment of spikes in population seen with rebound effect; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reduction in disease vectors and clean-up costs with reduction of rat carcasses; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Savings in reduction of the use of other integrated pest management protocols as populations decrease with ContraPest deployment; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Public relations advantages when reducing usage of poisons and other lethal products. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Focus Areas & Key Markets
 
As part of an integrated pest management program, ContraPest can target rat fertility and offer stable population control, to combat the most difficult rat infestations and assist in keeping manageable population levels going forward. This can limit the rebound effect seen with traditional rodent control measures, and with lower population levels in place, PMPs are able to reduce the number of ContraPest stations to accommodate a lower population, increasing their work flow efficiency and saving time to focus on integrating other integrated pest management tools to focus on prevention and maintenance rather than responding to population spikes.
 


Target markets include specific customers looking to reduce the level of lethal poisons as part of their pest management program including settings such as zoos, animal sanctuaries and island ecologies. As a stand-alone option, ContraPest can offer a non-lethal approach to helping PMPs bring and keep rat populations down.
 
Raw Materials and Manufacturing Process
 
ContraPest contains two active ingredients, VCD, an industrial chemical, and triptolide, a plant derived chemical from the Thunder God Vine, Tripterygium wilfordii. ContraPest also contains several other inactive ingredients. Currently, we source VCD from standard industrial chemical supply providers. Triptolide is derived from the Thunder God Vine, which is commonly cultivated and harvested wild in southeastern China and other Asian countries, and is available from a variety of sources. The process to purify triptolide for use in ContraPest is expensive, and we are currently investigating other, less costly sources of triptolide.
 
Our manufacturing process involves the incorporation of our two active ingredients, in low concentrations, into several inert ingredients. Once incorporated, the entire product goes through a micro-encapsulation process in order to stabilize the final formulation. Stabilizing the product in this manner allows it to be delivered to rodents in a non-lethal and effective manner.
 
Currently, we have production scale capability in our facilities in Arizona to manufacture ContraPest. Our internal production capabilities allow us to meet our current and anticipated demand during 2019 for ContraPest.
 
Scientific Background Regarding our Product
 
ContraPest is a liquid bait containing the active ingredients VCD and triptolide. When consumed, ContraPest targets reproduction, limiting fertility in male and female rats beginning with the first breeding cycle following consumption.
 
5


The female rat is born with a finite number of eggs, also called oocytes, and she remains fertile and will reproduce until the day she dies. Within the ovary, eggs are contained in structures called follicles. The non-regenerating and most immature stage of follicles is called primordial. The primordial follicles mature through several stages from primary to secondary to antral follicles and ultimately ovulate. Once the primordial follicles have become depleted, ovarian failure occurs, which terminates reproductive capability.
 
VCD has been well studied and causes specific loss of ovarian small follicles (both primordial and primary). Because oocytes do not regenerate, loss of these follicles leads to ovarian failure. Following repeated dosing, VCD causes ovarian failure in rats. However, daily dosing of rats with VCD does not produce generalized toxicity nor does it affect other tissues. A rat that consumes VCD will continue to reproduce until the pool of growing follicles are depleted through ovulation or atresia, which is the natural removal of follicles, which can take up to three months.
 
The second active ingredient, triptolide, stops growing follicles and exerts a significant suppression of male fertility by preventing sperm maturation impairing the movement of sperm. Female rats treated with triptolide ovulate fewer eggs because the follicles stop growing. Triptolide does not affect primordial follicles, but when used in combination with VCD, the result is contraception. The combination of VCD and triptolide profoundly effects the male.
 
Both VCD and triptolide are supported by evidence regarding their safety and mechanism of action. Additionally, recent studies, both in the lab and in the field, have documented their effect in fertility reduction and therefore reduction in rat populations. The graph below displays the total numbers of pups after two breeding rounds in one study.
 


Figure: Total number of rat pups born after consumption of ContraPest. Sixteen female rats (n=8 control and n=8 treatment) were provided ContraPest or inactive bait for 15 days and bred with proven male breeders. After two breeding rounds, the number of pups was totaled. The bar on the left shows the number of pups born to control females while the bar on the right shows the number of pups born to females that consumed ContraPest.
 
Other Potential Products
 
We have developed a pipeline of potential additional fertility control and animal health products, with diverse applications, as outlined in the following chart and in more detail below. As we focus on the commercialization of ContraPest, only minimal progress is expected on new product development during the coming year.

Product Candidate/Area | Development Status | Segment | Primary Target 
------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+--------------------------------+----------------------------
Feral animal fertility control | Pilot study | Population management | Feral dogs and hogs 
Non-surgical spay and neutering | Pilot study | Companion animal health | Companion dogs and cats 
Boar taint | Laboratory and initial pilot study | Food production and safety | Boars 
Animal cancer treatment | Concept | Companion animal health | Companion dogs

Boar Taint Product Candidate
 
Boar taint is the offensive odor or taste that can be evident during the cooking or eating of pork or pork products caused by hormones, called pheromones, present in non-castrated boars once they reach puberty. Castration without anesthesia shortly after birth is currently the standard procedure used to eliminate boar taint, but it results in lower meat production due to decreased weight gain, which is an effect of castration. This process also introduces a surgical risk of infection and can raise safety issues for workers.
 
If we are successful at developing a boar taint product candidate, we expect that it will target testosterone production and will be easily administered to feedlots and will have none of the safety issues associated with castration. The next step will be continued scientific and field studies followed by submission to and approval by the appropriate regulatory agencies.
 
Feral Animal Fertility Control Product Candidate
 
Feral dogs and hogs present problems both in the United States and internationally. The negative impacts of feral dogs include threats to human health and safety, agriculture, natural resources and property. Feral pigs can be aggressive and are known for damaging crops and transmitting diseases to humans, livestock and other wildlife.
 
Current strategies for controlling feral animal populations are often ineffective, difficult to conduct and costly. Studies have shown that our fertility control technology is effective in both these species. Further development on this product candidate is on hold, but we intend to pursue this further as resources become available.
 
Companion Animal Product Candidates
 
We would like to develop the following products for use in companion animals such as domestic dogs and cats. However, applications for companion animals require FDA approval, which is a much longer and more expensive regulatory process. Our expectation is that we will pursue these technologies through research and development arrangements with other stakeholders.
 
●                Non-Surgical Spay and Neutering Product Candidate. Based on a low average of $100 for each spay or neuter procedure, the spay and neutering of companion animals constitutes a significant market in the United States alone, with few effective non-surgical alternatives. We are developing a product that can be easily administered to the companion animal orally or by injection in combination with vaccinations. No surgery is required and the surgical risks of infection and pain could be eliminated. This product candidate targets the ovaries and testes and is delivered through a proprietary drug delivery methodology. Early field studies with feral dogs showed encouraging signs of efficacy.
 
●                Animal Cancer Treatment Product Candidate. Cancer therapy for companion animals is often not a viable option since chemotherapy can be a long, painful and expensive process. However, we have developed a manufacturing technology that allows the chemotherapeutics to be encapsulated and delivered directly to the affected tissues without causing the side effects to the immune, hypothalamic systems or neuro pathways.
 
Competition
 
Currently, we are unaware of any other non-lethal fertility control products that target rodents. There are complementary products that are used for managing rodent infestations, which include rodenticides, kill devices and traps, as well as other integrated pest management approaches such as exclusion and sanitation improvements.
 
While ContraPest can be used as a non-lethal, stand-alone solution, we also believe that it has a valuable role within a successful integrated pest management protocol. By targeting the reproduction of rats, ContraPest can offer a proven solution that allows pest managers to reduce even the most challenging rat infestations, helping keep populations down thus enabling them to focus their efforts on complementary techniques.
 
Government Regulation and Product Approval
 
Federal, state and local government authorities in the United States regulate, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, distribution and marketing of the products we develop. Our wildlife and pest fertility control products must be approved by the EPA Office of Pesticide Programs, or OPP, before they can be legally marketed and sold in the United States. The process for obtaining regulatory approval and compliance with appropriate federal, state and local regulations is rigorous and requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 
7


Additional product candidates in our pipeline may require approval from other government agencies, namely the USDA and FDA. In 2015, the FDA and EPA entered into a “data sharing” agreement to streamline data review and speed the regulatory process avoiding redundancy where possible, which may facilitate the approval process of our additional product candidates with the FDA.
 
United States Review and Approval Processes
 
In the United States, the EPA regulates the sale, distribution and use of any pesticide under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, or FIFRA. The EPA’s definition of a pesticide includes “any substance or mixture of substances intended for preventing, destroying, repelling, or mitigating any pest.” FIFRA defines a pest as “any insect, rodent, nematode, fungus, or weed.” To register a new product with the EPA, all active ingredients within the product must be registered with the EPA.
 
The EPA granted registration approval for ContraPest effective August 2, 2016. This EPA approval was granted on a restricted-use basis, including indoor and limited outdoor use, and is based on a liquid formation. On October 18, 2018, the EPA removed the Restricted Use designation. We intend to diligently pursue additional related regulatory approvals from the EPA to support our product evolution, including seeking approval for full outdoor use, alternative formulations and for additional rodent species. In addition to the EPA registration of ContraPest in the U.S., we must obtain registration from the various state regulatory agencies prior to selling in each state. To date, we have received registration for ContraPest in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, 23 of which have approved the removal of the Restricted Use designation.
 
International Review and Approval Processes
 
We are researching potential additional international markets and will evaluate regulatory landscapes of each prospective market. Country-specific regulatory laws have provisions that include requirements for certain labeling, safety, efficacy and manufacturers’ quality control procedures to assure the consistency of the products, as well as company records and reports. Some specific in-country studies will be required for particular countries but others will generally accept an EPA or EU compliant dossier.
Personnel
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 40 full-time, and four part-time employees including a total of two with Ph.D. degrees. Within our workforce, 21 employees are engaged in research and development and 23 in sales, business development, finance, legal, human resources, facilities, information technology and general management and administration.
 
With more focus on commercialization of ContraPest, we expect certain field support employees currently classified as research and development will be refocused on sales and marketing efforts and thus, reclassified as such.
 
None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements.
 
Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights
 
Maintaining a strong position in the rodenticide market requires constant innovation along with a healthy research program to evolve product lines to remain competitive and relevant to the needs of the changing global marketplace. We protect the intellectual property resulting from these efforts with the broadest international patent protections available. Our proprietary data and trade secrets are protected with vigilance and attention to data exchanges among employees, consultants, collaborators and research and trade partners. We further strengthen our market position employing international regulatory expertise.
Patent Filings
 
Our intellectual property portfolio supporting ContraPest consists of nine international patent filings (in the United States, Europe, Canada, Brazil, Russia, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and Australia) addressing the ContraPest compound. Claims directed toward the compound include composition-of-matter involving a diterpenoid epoxide or salts thereof in combination with an organic diepoxide, use claims for inducing follicle depletion and for reducing the reproductive capability of a mammalian animal or non-human mammalian population. Issued claims will have a patent term extending to 2033 or longer based on patent term determinations in each of the filing countries. The novelty of ContraPest extends to its method of field distribution and has required innovation to perfect the dosing of our product to rodents. We have filed United States and international patent applications covering our novel bait station device to effectively and efficiently deliver our rodent bait at individual bait sites that would, if issued, offer patent term protection through at least 2036.
License Agreements
 
We have an exclusive patent license with the University of Arizona for background intellectual property that we plan to employ for future product development in the domestic animal fertility control market. The patent claims in the United States, Australia and New Zealand cover the use of 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide to deplete ovarian follicles in individual mammals and mammal populations. The license agreement, signed in 2005, will terminate with the last-to-expire patent claims, which have a term extending to 2026.

Trade Secrets and Trademarks
 
Beyond our patent right holdings, we broaden our intellectual property position with trademark, trade secret, know-how and continuous scientific discovery to accompany our product development efforts. We protect these proprietary assets with a combination of confidentiality terms in all commercial agreements or stand-alone confidentiality agreements along with rights-ownership agreements and structured information transfer understandings prior to beginning any collaborative projects. We own and maintain the ContraPest trademark and intend to register new trademarks for products from our evolving rodenticide product line and for products for mammalian species beyond rodentia.
Data Sets
 
We have exclusive use status with the EPA for the data sets we have developed and submitted to the EPA as part of our application for ContraPest. The exclusive use status applies to new active ingredients and the final formulation of the ContraPest product for a period of 10 years. For five years after the 10-year period of exclusivity, if another applicant or the EPA Administrator chooses to rely on one or more data sets that we submitted in support of an application submitted by another applicant, the new applicant must make a binding offer to compensate us and certify to the EPA that it has done so. If we and the offeror cannot reach agreement on the terms of the compensation for the use of such data sets, FIFRA requires resolution by binding arbitration. The EPA rules do not describe how the compensation should be determined, and there is publicly available information about some, but not all, binding arbitration decisions. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for more information regarding our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.
