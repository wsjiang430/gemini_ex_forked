ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are an integrated producer of fruit-related products and a financial technology company. We engage in the production and sale of fruit juice concentrates (including fruit purees and fruit juices), fruit beverages (including fruit juice beverages and fruit cider beverages) in the PRC. Due to drastically increased production cost and tightened environmental law in China, the Company is transforming its business from fruit juice manufacturing and distribution to a real-name blockchain e-commerce platform that integrates blockchain and internet technology.


On January 22, 2019, the company formally launched of GlobalKey SharedMall, also known as Chain Cloud Mall (CCM) V1.0, the real-name and membership-based blockchain sharing shopping platform that integrates blockchain and internet technology and distinguishes itself by utilizing the automatic value distribution system of the blockchain and sharing the value of the platform to all the participants in the system.


On June 1, 2019, CCM V2.0 was launched. Compared to the 1.0 version, CCM v2.0 has a wider variety of product categories, easier user interface, more transparent information, more stable operation, higher security level, and faster logistics. Currently, CCM v2.0 adopts a “multi-vendor hosted stores + platform self-hosted stores” model, supported by multiple local warehouses in different regions. The platform supports various marketing methods, including point rewards programs, coupons, live webcasts, game interaction, and social media sharing. Besides the blockchain-powered features, CCM v2.0 is also fully equipped with the same functions and services that other Chinese leading traditional e-commerce platforms provide.


Based on blockchain technology, CCM is established to transform the relationship between companies and consumers from traditional selling and buying relationships to a value-sharing relationship. The platform will fairly distribute the benefit of the entire mall to users who engaged in the promotion, development, and consumption based on their contributions to the platform. The members of CCM are not only consumers and entrepreneurs but also participants, promoters and beneficiaries. The CCM shared shopping mall platform is designed to be a block-chain based shopping mall for merchants and goods, not the exchange of digital currencies, and it currently only accepts payment from credit cards, Alipay and Wechat.


On January 19, 2018, the Company filed a definitive Schedule 14A (the “Proxy”) to solicit shareholders’ proxies for a special meeting of the Company’s shareholders in connection with proposals to (i) spin-off the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries, SkyPeople Foods Holding Limited (“SkyPeople BVI”) and Digital Online Marketing Limited (“Digital Online”), through a pro rata distribution of the ordinary shares of each of SkyPeople BVI and Digital Online to holders of the Company’s common stock at the close of business on January 22, 2018, the record date (the “Spin Offs”); (ii) to approve an amendment to the Company’s Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, which increased the amount of authorized shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company from 8,333,333 to 60,000,000; (iii) adopted and approved the Future FinTech Group Inc. 2017 Omnibus Equity Plan; (iv) approved the issuance of an aggregate 7,111,599 shares of the Company’s common stock pursuant to certain Creditor’s Rights Transfer Agreements between a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and sellers of such creditor’s rights; and (v) approved the issuance of an aggregate 11,362,159 shares of the Company’s common stock pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement between the Company and a certain investor. On March 13, 2018, the Company held the Special Meeting of Shareholders and the above proposals were approved by the shareholders of the Company. The Company is currently reviewing the costs of completing the Spin Offs and registering the shares of SkyPeople BVI and Digital Online.


Our 60% owned subsidiary DCON DigiPay Limited develops and operates a global digital payment system, “DCON,” through blockchain technology. DCON is built to be a transparent digital payment system backed by blockchain technology and its mBTC is the only currency and payment system used in Nova Realm City (“NRC”) communities. Each Bitcoin exchanges for one million mBTC and DCON provides exchange services between its mBTC and Bitcoin. Bitcoin has a very high market value with each of them currently trading for thousands of dollars. As a currency, Bitcoin has limited everyday usage for ordinary payments. The mBTC has a 1,000,000:1 exchange rate pegged against Bitcoin and can be used in real life by consumers. Currently all of the members of the communities of NRC use mBTC to conduct their transactions. Currently, DCON charges no transaction fees for using mBTC and a 0.3% exchange fee for currency exchange between Bitcoin and mBTC. As of December 31, 2018, DCON DigiPay Limited has not generated any meaningful revenue from these blockchain-related technologies.

Competitive Advantages
 
For our juice products, we believe our competitive advantages include the modern equipment and technology employed at our production factories in Shaanxi Province and the strategic locations of our manufacturing facilities. Our equipment and technology help us to ensure product quality, control costs and allow us to meet international fruit juice production standards such as ISO9001, HACCP, and Kosher certifications, and those imposed by the United States Food and Drug Administration. In addition, our manufacturing facilities are strategically located near regional fruit production centers. For example, Shaanxi Province, where two of our manufacturing facilities are located, is known in the PRC for pear and kiwi production. Our proximity to regional fruit production centers enables us to purchase fresh fruits directly from farmers, avoid the need of transporting fresh fruit over long distances to processing facilities, reduce our transportation expenses and damage to fresh fruit during transportation and helps us maintain high quality of finished products by preserving freshness.
 
For our CCM shared shopping mall, We have a unique real-name and membership based blockchain e-commerce shopping platform that integrates blockchain, internet technology and distinguishes itself by utilizing the automatic value distribution system of the blockchain and sharing the value of the platform to all the participants in the system. In addition to providing value and convenience to our members, we reward them for referring new members and promoting our products and helping to generate transactions. Based on blockchain technology, CCM is established to transform the relationship between companies and consumers from traditional selling and buying relationship to a value-sharing relationship. The platform will fairly distribute the benefit of the entire mall to users who engage in promotion, development, and consumption based on their contributions to the platform. The members of CCM are not only consumers and entrepreneurs but also participants, promoters and beneficiaries.


We believe that our management team, which includes Vincent Xue, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Veronica Chen, our Chief Financial Officer, Yan Zhi, Our Chief Technology Officer, and a seasoned team of senior managers with significant experience in the areas of operations, marketing, technology and finance, is one of the strongest management teams in financial technology and integrated fruit-related products industry.

Principal Products and Services
 
There are two general categories of fruit and vegetable juices available in the market. One is fresh juice that is canned directly upon filtering and sterilization after being squeezed out of fresh fruits or vegetables. The other general category is juice drinks made out of concentrated fruit and vegetable juices. Concentrated fruit and vegetable juices are produced through the pressing, filtering, sterilization and evaporation of fresh fruits or vegetables. Concentrated juices are not drinkable. Instead, they are used as a basic ingredient for manufacturing juice drinks and as an additive to fruit wine, fruit jam, cosmetics and medicines.
 
Our core products are (1) fruit juice concentrates, mainly including concentrated apple, pear, and kiwi juices; (2) fruit beverages, including pure fruit beverages and fruit cider beverages; and (3) other fruit-related products, including, for example, fresh fruits, vegetables and fructose.
 
Fruit Juice Concentrate
 
Our family of fruit juice concentrate products mainly includes concentrated apple, pear, and kiwi juices. Fruit juice concentrates can only be produced during the “squeezing season” of a year, when fresh fruits are available in the market. Generally, the squeezing season for apples is from August through January or February of the following year, the squeezing season for pears is from July or August through April of the following year, and the squeezing season for kiwifruits is from September through December or January of the following year.

Fruit juice concentrates are manufactured through a multi-stage process, which includes pressing, filtering, sterilizing and evaporating fresh fruits and fruit juices.
 
Fruit juice concentrates are used as the base ingredient in fruit juice beverages and are also used in other products such as ice cream, fruit wine and, to a lesser extent, cosmetics and medicine.
 
We currently sell apple, pear, and kiwifruit concentrates. Our fruit juice concentrate products include concentrated apple and pear juice. Our concentrated kiwifruits are made of three different categories: kiwifruit puree, concentrated kiwifruit puree and concentrated kiwifruit juice.
 
Kiwifruit puree is prepared from clean, sound kiwifruits that have been washed and sorted prior to processing. The kiwifruits are crushed and pressed and the pulp of the kiwifruit is kept. All of the water and some of the pulp are then removed from the kiwifruit puree and the sugar level is increased in order to produce concentrated kiwifruit puree. We use advanced technologies to maintain the natural flavors and nutrients of the kiwifruit puree. Kiwifruit puree and concentrated kiwifruit puree are ideal raw materials used in the production of concentrated kiwifruit juices, kiwifruit beverages, kiwifruit flavored ice creams, smoothies and health care products. Concentrated kiwifruit juice is made from concentrated kiwifruit puree by removing all of the remaining pulp.
 
Our production line at the Shaanxi Qiyiwangguo factory can only produce puree and concentrated puree. We use the production line that produces concentrated apple and pear juice in the facility of the Jingyang branch of SkyPeople (China) to produce concentrated clear kiwifruit juice.
 
Concentrated apple juice and concentrated pear juice are prepared from fresh fruits. Fruit juice concentrates can also be combined with other fruit juices for the production of blended fruit juices, canned foods, confectionaries, fruit cider beverages and other beverage products.
 
Fruit Juice Beverages
 
As compared to our fruit juice concentrate products, which experience seasonality, fruit juice beverages can be produced and sold year-round.
 
The manufacturing process for fruit juice beverages involves further processing of fruit juice concentrates. Our fruit juice beverages are divided into two categories: pure fruit juice and fruit cider beverages. Currently we produce five flavors of fruit beverages in 236 ml glass bottles, 258 ml glass bottles, 280 ml glass bottles, 418 ml glass and 500 ml glass bottles, 888 ml glass bottles, 1.21 L glass bottles and BIB (bag in box) packages, including kiwifruit juice, mulberry juice, peach juice, pomegranate juice and fruit and vegetable juice. We also produce two flavors of lactobacillus fruit beverages in 268 ml glass bottles, including lactobacillus kiwifruit juice and lactobacillus mulberry juice, as well as three beverages with rich dietary fiber in 330 ml glass bottles, including kumquat and grapefruit juice, kiwifruit juice and mulberry juice. Our products are sold through distributors in stores.

Industry and Principal Markets
 
Market of Fruit Juice
 
Per the Bain & Company and Kantar Worldpanel 2018 CPI index for China, the total consumption of fast-moving consumer goods continued to rebound, with a growth rate of 52%, which was slightly higher than 47% in the previous year. In 2018, packaged food sales increased by 4.7%, while sales growth rates for beverages stayed at 1.5%. Sales of beverages increased by 1.5%, lower than the 2.8% growth in 2017.


From Dongxing Securites’ research report on the Food, Beverage and Juice Industry dated April 24, 2018, the overall growth of fruit juice is slow, so structural upgrade has become the key to boost growth. If comparing within the soft drink industry, the fruit juice segment has the lowest year-to-year growth. In 2013, the fruit juice industry experienced negative growth. The reason is that the demand side has undergone tremendous changes, and low-end juices with large market share are no longer popular. In 2016, there was a decline in sales volume and sales in China’s juice market. In recent years, low concentration juices have experienced declines in sales volume and sales; whereas mid concentration juices have the same sales performance as the juice segment as a whole, in which sales growth has slowed down. High concentration juices have experienced an increase in sales volume and price because of their high nutritional value and small customer base, and they has become the upgrade for most consumers.


E-commerce Industry and Social e-commerce Platforms in China
 
China’s online retail industry has experienced tremendous growth, with the overall market size growing from RMB3.88 trillion ($570 billion) in 2015 to RMB 9.01 trillion ($1.3 trillion) in 2018, according to China Internet Network Information Center. Within the growing online retail industry, social e-commerce platforms experienced robust growth and commanded an increasing share of the overall online retail industry. Social e-commerce platforms combine the attributes of mobile e-commerce and social media through its sharing element, and leverage social networks of its customers to lower the costs of customer acquisition. It decentralizes marketing and promotion activities from platform operators and manufacturers to the consumers/members of the platform, which provide more development opportunities for small and medium sized businesses which can’t afford large scale of promotion and marketing activities. The users of the platform and/or products are not only the consumers but also the recommenders and promoters for the products and the platforms. The social e-commerce platform market grew from RMB4.69 billion ($685 million) in 2015 to RMB 626.8 billion ($91.5 billion) in 2018, which represents a 255.8% increase compared to RMB 176.2 billion ($25.7billion) in 2017, according to iResearch Consulting Group. With the increasing use of social media, there is an increasing tendency for people to share their everyday lives and obtain information, including news, shopping needs and experience through social media. As of December 31, 2018, the monthly active account on wechat has increased to 1 billion and everyday there is average 750 million wechat users read the posts from their friends moments, according to iResearch Consulting Group.
Marketing, Sales and Distribution
 
We market our juice products through two primary methods: attendance at international exhibitions and sales made through distributors and trade websites. Our marketing and sales teams work closely together to maintain a consistent message to our customers.
 
The sales team is divided into three subdivisions, focusing on the sales of fruit juice concentrates, fruit beverage products and derivative products including foods, respectively. We sell our products either indirectly through distributors with good credit history or directly to end-users.
 
For our CCM shared shopping mall, we incentivize our members to recommend and market products through their own social networks and communities. Customers tend to find recommendations by influencers, including friends and families, more trustworthy. Members who promote products are rewarded if those users purchase our products.

The Chinese market drives our fruit beverage sales, with most beverages sold through provincial, city and county-level agents.
 
Competition
 
The markets in which we operate are competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to shifting customer demands and expectations. We believe that a number of companies are producing juice products that compete directly with our product offerings and some of our competitors have significantly more financial resources than we possess.
Our apple juice concentrate competitors include Sdic Zhounglu Fruit Juice Co., Ltd., Yantai North Andre (Group) Juice Co., Ltd., Shaanxi Hengxing Fruit Juice and Shaanxi Haisheng Juice Holdings Co., Ltd. We also compete with fruit juice companies such as Wahaha, Huiyuan, Nongfu Guoyuan, Tongyi and Meizhiyuan.
 
We believe our competitive advantages include our modern equipment and our proprietary processes for the production of specialty fruit juices or small breed fruit juices. Among the twenty-one proprietary technologies, we have obtained ten design patents, nine invention patents for production and two Utility Model Patents for equipment. Our current specialty fruit juice offering includes kiwifruit and mulberry related juice products. We also have technologies to produce concentrated persimmon, turnjujube, apricot, cherry, cherry tomato, sea-buckthorn, strawberry and wolfberry juices.
 
We believe the proximity of our manufacturing facilities to fruit farms is also one of our competitive advantages. It allows us to purchase fruit directly from fruit farmers, avoid the need for long distance transportation, minimize damages to the fruits and maximize the freshness of the fruits.
 
We produce fruit beverages from our fruit juice concentrates, which allows us to better control the quality of our beverages.
 
The e-commerce industry in China is intensely competitive. Our competitors include all major e-commerce companies in China, and other internet companies in China that engage in social e-commerce businesses.
 
We anticipate that the e-commerce industry will continually evolve and will continue to experience rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, shifting customer requirements, and frequent innovation. We must continually innovate to remain competitive.
 
We compete primarily on the basis of the following factors: (i) our ability to attract and retain a large number of members and other users and establish strong community bonding and maintain member loyalty through social interaction effectively, (ii) our shared shopping platform that enables users to buy products easily, (iii) strong fulfillment capabilities, including logistics and online payment, (iv) advanced technology infrastructure, and (v) reliable and flexible supply chain and strong manufacturing partner network.
 
We believe that we are well-positioned to effectively compete on the basis of the factors listed above. However, some of our current or future competitors may have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, better supplier relationships, larger user base or greater financial, technical or marketing resources than we do, and they may also adopt membership-based, value-sharing e-commerce models or other similar models on their platforms.
 
Raw Materials and Other Supplies
 
Fresh fruits, including apples, pears and kiwifruits are the primary raw materials for our products. The continuous supply of high quality fresh fruit is necessary for our current operations and our future business growth.
 
The PRC has the largest planting area of kiwifruit and apples in the world. Shaanxi Province, the location of two of our factories, has the largest planting area of kiwifruit and apples in the PRC. Pomegranate, strawberry, peach and cherry yields are also high in Shaanxi Province. Other raw materials used in our business include pectic enzyme, amylase, auxiliary power fuels and other power sources such as coal, electricity and water.

We purchase raw materials from local markets and fruit growers that deliver directly to our plants. We have implemented a fruit purchasing program in areas surrounding our factories. In addition, we organize purchasing centers in rich fruit production areas, helping farmers deliver fruit to our purchasing agents easily and in a timely manner. We are then able to deliver the fruit directly to our factory for production. We have assisted local farmers in their development of kiwifruit fields to help ensure a high quality product throughout the production channel. Our raw material supply chain is highly fragmented and raw fruit prices are highly volatile.
 
Shaanxi Province is a large agricultural and fruit producing province with sufficient resources to satisfy our raw material needs. Shaanxi Province is also the main pear-producing province in the PRC and its pear supply can generally meet our production requirements.
 
In addition to raw materials, we purchase various ingredients and packaging materials such as sweeteners, glass and plastic bottles, cans and packing barrels. We generally purchase our materials or supplies from multiple suppliers. We are not dependent on any one supplier or group of suppliers.
 
Seasonality
 
We can only produce fruit juice concentrates during the squeezing season generally from July or August through April of the following year, while our fruit juice beverages can be produced year round. Annual capacity of our production lines varies based on the availability of the fresh fruit and is ultimately contingent on weather and other climatic conditions leading up to and through the harvest seasons. As a result, our fruit juice business is highly seasonal as sales of our products are generally higher during the squeezing season. Sales of our juice products during the months from March through July, or the non-squeezing season, generally tend to be lower due to a shortage of fresh fruit and a lower level of production activity.

Government Regulations
 
Food and Beverage Regulations and Permits
 
Our products are subject to central government regulation as well as provincial government regulation in Shaanxi, Hubei and Liaoning Provinces. Business and product licenses must be obtained through application to the central, provincial and local governments. We have obtained our business licenses to operate domestically and export products under the laws and regulations of the PRC. We obtained business licenses to conduct businesses, including an operating license to sell packaged foods such as concentrated fruit and vegetable juices, fruit sugar, fruit pectin, frozen and freeze dried fruits and vegetables, dehydrated fruits and vegetables, fruit and vegetable juice drinks, fruit cider and organic food. Business, company and product registrations are certified on a regular basis and we must comply with the laws and regulations of the PRC, provincial and local governments and industry agencies.
 
In accordance with PRC laws and regulations, we are required to comply with applicable hygiene and food safety standards in relation to our production processes. Failure to pass these inspections, or the loss of or failure to renew our licenses and permits, could require us to temporarily or permanently suspend some or all of our production activities, which could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business.
 
The Chinese government recently tightened its enforcement of existing and new environmental regulations.The Company is in the process of adapting to the new standards and certain of our construction projects have been delayed.
 
Regulations Relating to E-Commerce
 
In January 2014, the former State of Administration of Industry and Commerce (which has been merged into State Administration for Market Regulation or SAMR) adopted the Administrative Measures for Online Trading, or the Online Trading Measures, which took effect in March 2014. Under the Online Trading Measures, e-commerce platform operators are required to examine, register and archive the identity information of the merchants applying for access to their platforms as sellers, and verify and update such information regularly. The Online Trading Measures also provide that e-commerce platform operators must make publicly available (i) the link to or the information contained in the business licenses of the merchants, in the case of business entities, or (ii) a label confirming the verified identity of the merchants, in the case of individuals. A consumer is entitled to return the commodities within seven days after receipt of the commodities without giving a reason, except for the following commodities: customized commodities, fresh and perishable commodities, audio-visual products downloaded online or unpackaged by consumers and computer software and other digital commodities, and newspapers and journals that have been delivered. E-commerce platform operators must, within seven days upon receipt of the returned commodities, provide full refunds to consumers. In addition, operators are prohibited from setting forth provisions in contracts or other terms that are not fair or reasonable to consumers such as those excluding or restraining consumers’ rights, relieving or exempting operators’ responsibilities, and increasing the consumers’ responsibilities, or conducting transactions in a forcible manner taking advantage of contractual terms or technical means.
 
In March 2016, the State Administration of Taxation, or the SAT, the Ministry of Finance, or the MOF, and the General Administration of Customs jointly issued the Circular on Tax Policy for Cross-Border E-Commerce Retail Imports, which took effect in April 2016. Pursuant to this circular, goods imported through the cross-border e-commerce retail are subject to tariff, import value-added tax, and consumption tax based on the types of goods. Individuals purchasing any goods imported through cross-border e-commerce retail are taxpayers, and e-commerce companies, companies operating e-commerce transaction platforms or logistic companies are required to withhold the taxes.
 
On August 31, 2018, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress promulgated the E-Commerce Law, which became effective on January 1, 2019. The E-Commerce Law sets forth a series of requirements on e-commerce platform operators. According to the E-Commerce Law, e-commerce platform operators shall verify and register platform merchants, and cooperate with the market regulatory administrative department and tax administrative department to conduct industry and commerce registrations and tax registrations for merchants. The e-commerce platform operators shall also prepare a contingency plan for cybersecurity events and take technological measures and other measures to prevent online illegal and criminal activities. The E-Commerce Law also expressly requires platform operators to take necessary actions to ensure fair dealing on their platforms to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of consumers, including to prepare platform service agreements and transaction information record-keeping and transaction rules, to prominently display such documents on the platform’s website, and to keep such information for no fewer than three years following the completion of a transaction. To legally handle intellectual property infringement disputes, upon receipt of the notice specifying preliminary evidence for alleged infringement, the platform operators are required to take necessary measures in a timely manner, such as deleting, blocking and disconnecting the hyperlinks, terminating transactions and services, and forwarding notices to merchants on its platform. If an e-commerce platform operator fails to take necessary measures when it knows or should have known that a merchant on the platform infringes any third-party intellectual property rights, products or services provided by a merchant on its platform do not meet the requirements regarding personal or property safety, or any merchant otherwise impairs the lawful rights and interests of consumers, the e-commerce platform operator will be held jointly liable with the merchants on its platform.
 
19

 

Moreover, the E-Commerce Law imposes a requirement on operators of e-commerce platforms to assist in tax collection with respect to income generated by sellers from transactions conducted on e-commerce platforms, including among others, submitting to the tax authority information on the identities of sellers on e-commerce platforms and other information relating to tax payment. Failure to comply with the requirement may result in operators of e-commerce platform being subject to fines and, in severe circumstances, suspension of business operations of e-commerce platforms. If the members on our platform were deemed to be selling our products on consignment basis, the PRC tax authorities may require our members to make tax registration and request our assistance in these efforts, pursuant to the new E-Commerce Law, and our members may be subject to more stringent tax compliance requirements. See “Risk Factors—The newly adopted E-Commerce Law may have a material impact on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.” According to the EIT Law, the VAT Law and other applicable regulations, sellers that conduct transactions on e-commerce platforms are generally subject to enterprise income tax at a rate of 25%, and value-added tax at a rate of 13% or 9% for services or products sold on the e-commerce platforms. Certain sellers that are deemed as small taxpayers under PRC law are subject to reduced value-added tax at a rate of 3%.
 
Value-Added Telecommunication Business Operating Licenses
 
The PRC Telecommunications Regulations, or the Telecom Regulations, which were issued by the State Council in 2000 and were most recently amended in February 2016 are the primary governing law on telecommunication services. The Telecom Regulations set out the general framework for the provision of telecommunication services by PRC entities. Under the Telecom Regulations, telecommunications service providers are required to procure operating licenses prior to their commencement of operations. The Telecom Regulations draw a distinction between “basic telecommunications services” and “value-added telecommunications services.” A “Catalog of Telecommunications Business” was issued as an attachment to the Telecom Regulations to categorize telecommunications services as basic or value-added. In December 2015, MIIT released the Catalog of Telecommunication Business (2015 Revision), or the 2015 Telecom Catalog, implemented in March 2016. Under the 2015 Telecom Catalog, both the online data processing and transaction processing business (i.e., operating e-commerce business) and information service business, continue to be categorized as value-added telecommunication services.
 
In March 2009, MIIT issued the Administrative Measures for Telecommunications Business Operating Permit, or the Telecom Permit Measures, which was implemented in 2009 and most recently amended in 2017. Pursuant to the Telecom Permit Measures, the operation scope of the value-added telecommunication business operating license, or VATS license, shall detail the permitted activities of the enterprise to which it is granted. An approved telecommunication services operator shall conduct its business in accordance with the specifications recorded on its VATS License. The VATS Licenses can be further categorized based on the specific business operations permitted to be carried out under such licenses, including among others, the VATS Licenses for internet information services, or the ICP License, and the VATS License for electronic data interchange business, or the EDI License. In addition, a VATS License holder is required to obtain approval from the original permit-issuing authority prior to any change to its shareholders, business scope or other information recorded on such license. In February 2015, the State Council has issued the Decisions on Cancelling and Adjusting a Batch of Administrative Approval Items, which, among others, replaced the pre-registration approval requirement for telecommunications business with post-registration approval requirement.
 
In September 2000, the State Council promulgated the Administrative Measures on Internet Information Services, or the Internet Measures, most recently amended in January 2011. Under the Internet Measures, “internet information services” refer to the provision of information through the internet to online users, and are divided into “commercial internet information services” and “non-commercial internet information services”. Commercial internet information services operators shall obtain an ICP License, from the relevant government authorities within China. Chain Cloud Mall E-commerce (Tianjin) Co., Ltd., our VIE, holds our VATS License for our Value-Added Telecommunication businesses.

Regulations Relating to Internet Information Security and Privacy Protection
 
Internet information in China is regulated from a national security standpoint. The National People’s Congress, or the NPC, has enacted the Decisions on Preserving Internet Security in December 2000 and amended in August 2009, which subject violators to potential criminal punishment in China for any attempt to: (i) gain improper entry into a computer or system of strategic importance; (ii) disseminate politically disruptive information; (iii) leak state secrets; (iv) spread false commercial information; or (v) infringe intellectual property rights. The Ministry of Public Security of the PRC, or the MPS, has promulgated the Administrative Measures for the Computer Information Network and Internet Security Protection in December 1998 and amended in January 2011, which prohibits use of the internet in ways which, among other things, result in a leak of state secrets or a spread of socially destabilizing content. If an internet information service provider violates these measures, the MPS and its local branches may issue warning, confiscate the illegal gains, impose fines, and, in severe cases, advice competent authority to revoke its operating license or shut down its websites.
 
Under the Several Provisions on Regulating the Market Order of Internet Information Services, issued by the MIIT in December 2011 and implemented in March 2012, an internet information service provider may not collect any user personal information or provide any such information to third parties without the consent of the user. An internet information service provider must expressly inform the users of the method, content and purpose of the collection and processing of such user personal information and may only collect such information necessary for the provision of its services. An internet information service provider is also required to properly maintain the user’s personal information, and in case of any leak or likely leak of the user’s personal information, the internet information service provider must take immediate remedial measures and, in severe circumstances, immediately report to the telecommunications authority. Moreover, pursuant to the Ninth Amendment to the Criminal Law issued by the SCNPC in August 2015 and implemented in November 2015, any internet service provider that fails to fulfill the obligations related to internet information security administration as required by applicable laws and refuses to rectify upon orders, shall be subject to criminal penalty for the result of (i) any dissemination of illegal information in large scale; (ii) any severe effect due to the leakage of the client’s information; (iii) any serious loss of criminal evidence; or (iv) other severe situation. Any individual or entity that (i) sells or provides personal information to others in a way violating the applicable law, or (ii) steals or illegally obtains any personal information, shall be subject to criminal penalty in severe situation. In addition, the Interpretations of the Supreme People’s Court and the Supreme People’s Procuratorate of the PRC on Several Issues Concerning the Application of Law in Handling Criminal Cases of Infringing Personal Information, issued in May 2017 and implemented in June 2017, clarified certain standards for the conviction and sentencing of the criminals in relation to personal information infringement.
 
In November 2016, the SCNPC promulgated the Cyber Security Law of the PRC, or the Cyber Security Law, which became effective on June 1, 2017. The Cyber Security Law requires that a network operator, which includes, among others, internet information services providers, take technical measures and other necessary measures in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and the compulsory requirements of the national and industrial standards to safeguard the safe and stable operation of its networks. We are subject to such requirements as we are operating websites and mobile applications and providing certain internet services mainly through our mobile applications. The Cyber Security Law further requires internet information service providers to formulate contingency plans for network security incidents, report to the competent departments immediately upon the occurrence of any incident endangering cyber security and take corresponding remedial measures.
 
Internet information service providers are also required to maintain the integrity, confidentiality and availability of network data. The Cyber Security Law reaffirms the basic principles and requirements specified in other existing laws and regulations on personal data protection, such as the requirements on the collection, use, processing, storage and disclosure of personal data, and internet information service providers being required to take technical and other necessary measures to ensure the security of the personal information they have collected and prevent the personal information from being divulged, damaged or lost. Any violation of the Cyber Security Law may subject the internet information service provider to warnings, fines, confiscation of illegal gains, revocation of licenses, cancellation of filings, shutdown of websites or criminal liabilities.
 
21

 

Furthermore, MIIT’s Rules on Protection of Personal Information of Telecommunications and Internet Users promulgated in July 2013, effective September 2013, contain detailed requirements on the use and collection of personal information as well as security measures required to be taken by telecommunications business operators and internet information service providers.
 
Regulations Relating to Pyramid Selling in the PRC
 
The Regulations on Prohibition of Pyramid Selling, that were promulgated by the State Council in August 2005 and became effective in November 2005, prohibit pyramid selling activities. According to the Regulations on Prohibition of Pyramid Selling, the following activities taken by organizers or operators are considered as “pyramid selling”: (i) taking in new members and compensating each member by giving material awards or other financial benefits, based upon the number of new members directly or indirectly introduced by such member on a rolling basis, so as to gain illegal benefits; or (ii) requesting a sum of money as entry fee or as a condition to membership for new members, either directly or through purchasing commodities, so as to gain illegal benefits; or (iii) requesting members to introduce additional members to establish a multi-level relationship and compensating each member based on the level of sales generated by the additional members introduced by such member, so as to gain illegal benefits. The PRC laws and regulations have not defined “illegal benefit” and the determination of gaining “illegal benefit” is to a large extent subject to discretionary view of the competent authorities in the PRC. Any individual or entity engaging in organization of pyramid selling may be subject to confiscation of illegal gains and fines ranging from RMB0.5 million to RMB2.0 million (US$0.3 million), and even criminal liabilities if a crime is constituted. On March 23, 2016, the former State of Administration of Industry and Commerce (which has been merged into SAMR) promulgated the Risk Warning for New Types of Pyramid Selling, which provides that if an activity satisfies the three features stated above at the same time, it will be identified as pyramid selling, regardless of whether any illegal benefit is obtained.
 
Regulations Relating to Intellectual Property in the PRC
 
Trademark
 
The PRC Trademark Law and its implementation rules protect registered trademarks. The PRC Trademark Office of State Administration of Industry and Commerce is responsible for the registration and administration of trademarks throughout the PRC. The Trademark Law has adopted a “first-to-file” principle with respect to trademark registration. Registered trademarks are granted a valid term of ten years, which could be renewed each time for another ten years commencing from the day after the expiry date of the last period of validity if the required renewal formalities have been completed. Pursuant to the PRC Trademark Law, counterfeit or unauthorized production of the label of another person’s registered trademark, or sale of any label that is counterfeited or produced without authorization will be deemed as an infringement to the exclusive right to use a registered trademark. The infringing party will be ordered to stop the infringement immediately, a fine may be imposed, and the counterfeit goods will be confiscated. The infringing party may also be held liable for the right holder’s damages, which will be equal to the gains obtained by the infringing party or the losses suffered by the right holder as a result of the infringement, including reasonable expenses incurred by the right holder for stopping the infringement.
Domain Name
 
The MIIT promulgated the Measures on Administration of Internet Domain Names, or the Domain Name Measures, on August 24, 2017, which took effect on November 1, 2017. The MIIT is the major regulatory body responsible for the administration of PRC internet domain names, under supervision of which the China Internet Network Information Center, or CNNIC, is responsible for the daily administration of “.cn” domain names and Chinese domain names. CNNIC adopts a “first-to-file” principle with respect to the registration of domain names. Applicants for registration of domain names must provide the true, accurate and complete information of their identities to domain name registration service institutions. The applicants will become the holder of such domain names upon the completion of the registration procedure.
  
22

 

Copyright
 
The PRC Copyright Law, or the Copyright Law, which took effect on June 1, 1991 and was amended in 2001 and 2010, provides that Chinese citizens, legal persons, or other organizations shall, whether published or not, own copyright in their copyrightable works, which include, among others, works of literature, art, natural science, social science, engineering technology and computer software. Copyright owners enjoy certain legal rights, including the right of publication, right of authorship and right of reproduction. The Copyright Law extends copyright protection to Internet activities, products disseminated over the Internet and software products. In addition, the Copyright Law provides for a voluntary registration system administered by the China Copyright Protection Center, or the CPCC. According to the Copyright Law, an infringer of the copyrights shall be subject to various civil liabilities, which include ceasing infringement activities, apologizing to the copyright owners and compensating the loss of copyright owner. Infringers of copyright may also subject to fines and/or administrative or criminal liabilities in severe situations.
 
Pursuant to the Computer Software Copyright Protection Regulations promulgated by the State Council on December 20, 2001 and amended on January 30, 2013, Chinese citizens, legal persons and other organizations shall enjoy copyright on software they develop, regardless of whether the software is released publicly. Software copyright commences from the date on which the development of the software is completed. The protection period for software copyright of a legal person or other organizations shall be 50 years, concluding on December 31 of the 50th year after the software’s initial release. The software copyright owner may go through the registration formalities with a software registration authority recognized by the State Council’s copyright administrative department. The software copyright owner may authorize others to exercise that copyright, and is entitled to receive remuneration.

We believe that these technologies are leading technologies in our industry in China.
 
In addition, using our proprietary technologies, we have developed flow-through capacitor membrane, reverse osmosis concentration and composite biological enzymolysis technology to clarify and remove murkiness from fruit juice. We believe that such are leading technologies in our industry in China.
 
We believe that our continued success and competitive status depend largely on our proprietary technology and ability to innovate. We have taken the required measures to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary technologies and processes. We rely on a combination of know-how, patent and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary rights. We will take the necessary action to seek remuneration if we believe our intellectual property rights have been infringed upon. As of December 31, 2018, we held twenty-one active patents granted by SIPO related to breaking up and separating fruit peel; removing fruit peel and fruit hair; production of various concentrated fruit juice; and bottle tags, respectively. These patents have a duration of 10 years. However, we do not have patents on certain other intellectual property that we possess.
 
We also hold registered trademarks for our “Hedetang” brand with the Trademark Bureau of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (“SAIC”) granted on September 14, 2008 in Category 29, Category 30, Category 31 and Category 32, and on April 21, 2009 in Category 5. The trademarks expire on September 13, 2028 and April 20, 2029, respectively, and can be extended upon expiration.
 
We hold registered trademarks for our “SkyPeople” brand with the Trademark Bureau of the SAIC in Category 30 and Category 32 with period of validity from May 14, 2011 to May 13, 2021, and in Category 31 with period of validity from September 7, 2011 to September 6, 2021.
