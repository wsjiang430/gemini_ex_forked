Our Company
 
Creative Realities, Inc. is a Minnesota corporation that provides innovative digital marketing technology solutions to a broad range of companies, individual brands, enterprises, and organizations throughout the United States and in certain international markets. We have expertise in a broad range of existing and emerging digital marketing technologies across 18 vertical markets, as well as the related media management and distribution software platforms and networks, device and content management, product management, customized software service layers, systems, experiences, workflows, and integrated solutions. Our technology and solutions include: digital merchandising systems and omni-channel customer engagement systems; content creation, production and scheduling programs and systems; a comprehensive series of recurring maintenance, support, and field service offerings; interactive digital shopping assistants, advisors and kiosks; and, other interactive marketing technologies such as mobile, social media, point-of-sale transactions, beaconing and web-based media that enable our customers to transform how they engage with consumers.
 
Our main operations are conducted directly through Creative Realities, Inc., and under our wholly owned subsidiaries Allure Global Solutions, Inc., Creative Realities Canada, Inc., and ConeXus World Global, LLC. Our other wholly owned subsidiary Creative Realities, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, has been effectively dormant since October 2015, the date of the merger with ConeXus World Global, LLC.
 
We generate revenue in this business by:
 

● | consulting with our customers to determine the technologies and solutions required to achieve their specific goals, strategies and objectives; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | designing our customers’ digital marketing experiences, content and interfaces; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | engineering the systems architecture delivering the digital marketing experiences we design – both software and hardware – and integrating those systems into a customized, reliable and effective digital marketing experience; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | managing the efficient, timely and cost-effective deployment of our digital marketing technology solutions for our customers; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | delivering and updating the content of our digital marketing technology solutions using a suite of advanced media, content and network management software products; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | maintaining our customers’ digital marketing technology solutions by: providing content production and related services; creating additional software-based features and functionality; hosting the solutions; monitoring solution service levels; and responding to and/or managing remote or onsite field service maintenance, troubleshooting and support calls. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These activities generate revenue through: bundled-solution sales; consulting services, experience design, content development and production, software development, engineering, implementation, and field services; software license fees; and maintenance and support services related to our software, managed systems and solutions.
 
We currently market and sell our technology and solutions primarily through our sales and business development personnel, but we also utilize agents, strategic partners, and lead generators who provide us with access to additional sales, business development and licensing opportunities.

Our digital marketing technology solutions have application in a wide variety of industries. The industries in which we sell our solutions are established and include automotive, apparel & accessories, banking, baby/children, beauty, CPG, department stores, digital out-of-home (“DOOH”), electronics, fashion, fitness, foodservice/quick service restaurant (“QSR”), financial services, gaming, luxury, mass merchants, mobile operators, and pharmacy retail; however, the planning, development, implementation and maintenance of technology-enabled experiences involving combinations of digital marketing technologies is relatively new and evolving.  Moreover, a number of participants in these industries have only recently started considering or expanding the adoption of these types of technologies, solutions and experiences as part of their overall marketing strategies.  As a result, we remain without an established history of profitability.
 
We believe that the adoption and evolution of digital marketing technology solutions will increase substantially in years to come both in the industries in which we currently focus and in others. We also believe that adoption of our solutions depends not only upon the services and solutions that we provide but also upon the cost of hardware used to process and display content. While the costs of hardware configurations and software media players have historically decreased and we believe they will continue to do so at an accelerating rate, flat panel displays and players typically constitute a large portion of the expenditure customers make relative to the entire cost of implementing a digital marketing system implementation and can be a barrier to customer deployment. As a result, we believe that the broader adoption of digital marketing technology solutions is likely to increase, although we cannot predict the rate at which such adoption will occur.
 
Another key component of our business strategy, given the evolving dynamics of the industry in which we operate, is to acquire and integrate other operating companies in the industry in conjunction with pursuing our organic growth objectives. We believe that the selective acquisition and successful integration of certain companies will: accelerate our growth in targeted vertical and operating markets; enable us to cost-effectively aggregate multiple customer bases onto a single business and technology platform; provide us with greater operating scale on a consolidated basis; enable us to leverage a common set of processes and tools, and cost efficiencies company-wide; and ultimately result in higher operating profitability and cash flow from operations. Our management team evaluates acquisition opportunities on an ongoing basis. Our management team and Board of Directors have broad experience with the execution, integration and financing of acquisitions. We believe that, based on the foregoing, we can successfully serve as a consolidator of multiple business and technology platforms serving similar markets.

Corporate Organization
 
Our principal offices are located at 13100 Magisterial Drive, Ste 100, Louisville, Kentucky 40223, and our telephone number at that office is (502) 791-8800.
 
The legal entity that is the registrant was originally incorporated and organized as a Minnesota corporation under the name Wireless Ronin Technologies, Inc. in March 2003. Our business initially focused on the provision of expertise in digital media marketing solutions to customers, including digital signage, interactive kiosks, mobile, social media and web-based media solutions. We acquired the assets and business of Broadcast International, Inc., a Utah corporation and public registrant, through a merger transaction that was effective as of August 1, 2014. Then on August 20, 2014, we consummated a merger transaction with Creative Realities, LLC, a privately owned Delaware limited liability company, in which we issued a majority of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. In that merger transaction, we acquired the interactive marketing technology business of Creative Realities that we currently operate. Shortly after that merger, we changed our corporate name from Wireless Ronin Technologies, Inc. to “Creative Realities, Inc.” On October 15, 2015, we acquired the assets and business of ConeXus World Global, LLC, a privately-owned Kentucky limited liability company for which we issued preferred and common stock. In that merger transaction, we acquired the systems integration and marketing technology business of ConeXus World that we currently operate. On May 23, 2016, we dissolved Broadcast International, Inc. On November 20, 2018, we acquired Allure Global Solutions, Inc. (“Allure”), an enterprise software development company (as further described below).

Our corporate structure, including our principal operating subsidiaries, is as follows:
 


Our fiscal year ends December 31. Neither we nor any of our predecessors have been in bankruptcy, receivership or any similar proceeding.
 
Recent Capitalization Events
 
Acquisition of Allure Global Solutions, Inc.
 
On September 20, 2018, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Christie Digital Systems, Inc. (“Seller”) to acquire Allure, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Seller (the “Allure Acquisition”). Allure, headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, is an enterprise software development company providing software solutions, a suite of complementary services, and ongoing support for an array of digital media and POS solutions. Allure provides a wide range of products for the theatre, restaurant, convenience store, theme park, and retail spaces and works to create, develop, deploy, and maintain enterprise software solutions including those designed specifically to integrate, manage, and power ambient client-owned networks. Those networks manage data and marketing content that has been designed and proven to influence consumer purchase behavior. The Allure Acquisition closed on November 20, 2018.
 
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement, upon the closing of the Allure Acquisition, we acquired ownership of all of Allure’s issued and outstanding capital shares in consideration for a total purchase price of approximately $8,450, subject to a post-closing working capital adjustment. Of this purchase price amount, we paid $6,300 in cash. Of the remaining purchase price amount, approximately $1,250 is to be paid to former management of Allure, and approximately $900 due from Allure to the Seller, under an existing Note which was amended and restated for this reduced amount. That debt is represented by our issuance to the Seller of a promissory note accruing interest at 3.5% per annum. The promissory note will require us to make quarterly payments of interest only through February 19, 2020, on which date the promissory note will mature and all remaining amounts owing thereunder will be due. We are able to prepay in whole or in part amounts owing under the promissory note, without penalty, at our option, at any time and from time to time.


The promissory note is convertible into shares of Creative Realities common stock, at the Seller’s option on or after the 180th day after issuance, at an initial conversion price of $8.40 per share, subject to customary equitable adjustments. Conversion of all amounts owing under the promissory note will be mandatory if the 30-day volume-weighted average price of our common stock exceeds 200% of the common stock trading price at the closing of the Allure Acquisition. We granted the Seller customary registration rights for the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the promissory note.
 
The Purchase Agreement contemplates additional consideration or $2,000 to be paid by us to Seller in the event that Allure’s revenue exceeds $13,000, wherein revenues from one specifically-named customer add only 70% of their gross value to the total, for any of (i) the 12-month period ending December 31, 2019, or (ii) any of the next following trailing 12-month periods ending on each of March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, 2020.

Common Stock
 
Reverse Stock Split
 
On October 17, 2018, the Company effectuated a l-for-30 reverse stock split of its outstanding common stock. The accompanying financial statements and notes to the financial statements give retroactive effect to the reverse stock split for all periods presented. The shares of common stock retained a par value of $0.01 per share.
Public Offering
 
On November 19, 2018, the Company announced the closing of its underwritten public offering of 2,857,142 shares of its common stock and warrants to purchase 1,428,571 shares of common stock at a combined public offering price of $3.50 per share and warrant (“Public Offering”). The gross proceeds to the Company from this the Public Offering were approximately $10,000, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses. The proceeds were primarily used in the Allure Acquisition and in the repayment of approximately $1,283 of debt.
Conversions
 
In 2018 and 2017, the following Preferred Stock conversions took place:

See additional information on issuance of common stock as the result of conversions of Preferred Stock and Convertible Promissory Notes, respectively, within the “Conversion of Series A Preferred Stock” and “Conversion of Convertible Promissory Notes” sections below.
 
Conversion of Series A Preferred Stock
 
The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”) entitles its holders to a 6% dividend, payable semi-annually in cash or in kind through the three-year anniversary of the original issue date, and from and after such three-year anniversary in duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock. As described in detail below, no Series A Preferred Stock is outstanding as of December 31, 2018.
 
During the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, the Company issued an aggregate of 0 and 245,816 shares of Series A Preferred Stock in satisfaction of its semi-annual dividend obligation. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, the Company issued an aggregate of 45,856 and 23,962 shares of common stock in satisfaction of its semi-annual dividend obligation.

On November 5, 2018, the requisite holders of Series A Preferred Stock agreed to convert the entire class of Series A Preferred Stock into common stock at the conversion price of $7.65 per share, as required by the applicable Certificate of Designation. Such conversion was contingent upon a successful Public Offering of at least $10,000, which the Company completed on November 19, 2018.
 
Holders of Series A Preferred Stock received 723,561 shares of common stock at the stated conversion rate as determined pursuant to the Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation upon completion of the Public Offering on November 19, 2018. Those holders of Series A Preferred Stock who executed a customary lock-up agreement for a period continuing for 90 days after the consummation of the Public Offering were issued, as a one-time incentive for such agreement, additional common stock and warrants, in such number that made the effective conversion price of the Series A Preferred Stock equal to 90% of the effective price per unit sold in the Public Offering. Those holders of Series A Preferred Stock who participated in the Public Offering, subject to a minimum participation requirement as agreed between the underwriters and the Company, and executed the foregoing lock-up agreement received, as a one-time additional incentive, additional common stock and warrants in such number that decreased the effective conversion price on the conversion of Series A Preferred Stock to 80% of the effective price per unit sold in the Public Offering. Upon completion of the Company’s public offering on November 19, 2018, the Company issued an additional 1,123,367 shares of common stock to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock in exchange for the foregoing incentives to execute a lock-up agreement and participate in the Public Offering. The lock-up agreements applied to all shares of common stock issued to convert the holder’s Series A Preferred Stock, and the additional shares of common stock and warrants, and underlying warrant shares, issued by the Company in exchange for the holder’s execution of the lock-up agreement and participation in the Public Offering. As a result of this conversion, there remains no Series A Preferred Stock outstanding as of December 31, 2018.
 
For purposes of the Company’s conversion, the conversion date coincided with a public offering which provided an adequate measurement of fair value of the common stock and warrants to purchase common stock at $3.50 per (one share of common stock and one-half warrant to purchase one share of common stock). The Company recorded a charge of $3,932 upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock into common stock. The calculation of the incremental inducement represents the fair value of consideration given in excess of the fair value of securities at the stated conversion price of the converted instruments. The charge is presented in the statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 below net loss in arriving at net income loss available to common shareholders.
 
On March 18, 2019, the Company filed Statements of Cancellation with the Minnesota Secretary of State that eliminated from the Company’s Articles of Incorporation all matters set forth in the Certificates of Designation of Preferences, Rights and Limitations with respect to the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock. No shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock or Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock were issued or outstanding at the time of the filing of the Statements of Cancellation.
 
In 2017, 385,200 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and 1,860,561 shares of Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock were converted into 293,571 shares of common stock at the conversion rate of $7.65 per share.
 
Conversion of Convertible Promissory Notes
 
On October 29, 2018, the holder of our convertible promissory notes, Slipstream Communications LLC (“Slipstream”), agreed to convert $4,954,938 of outstanding principal, including paid-in-kind interest and all accrued interest thereon into shares of our common stock and warrants at a conversion price equal to the lower of $7.65, or 80% of the price at which shares of common stock are sold in the Public Offering. The conversion was contingent upon (i) the conversion of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock, and (ii) the successful completion of the Public Offering of at least $10,000, each of which were successfully completed on November 19, 2018. In exchange for participation in the Public Offering, subject to a minimum participation requirement as agreed between the underwriters and the Company, and Slipstream’s execution of a lock-up agreement, Slipstream received, as a one-time incentive, additional common stock and warrants in such number that decreased the effective conversion price of the convertible notes to 70% of the lowest of those scenarios outlined above. Upon completion of the Company’s Public Offering on November 19, 2018, the convertible promissory notes were converted into 2,039,152 shares of the Company’s common stock. The lock-up agreement applied to all shares of common stock and warrants issued to Slipstream and underlying warrant shares.

For purposes of the Company’s conversion, the conversion date coincided with a public offering which provided an adequate measurement of fair value of the common stock and warrants to purchase common stock at $3.50 per (one share of common stock and one-half warrant to purchase one share of common stock). The Company recorded debt conversion expense of $5,055 in connection with issuance of incentive shares issued upon conversion of the convertible promissory notes into common stock. The calculation of the incremental inducement represents the fair value of consideration given in excess of the fair value of securities at the stated conversion price of the converted instruments. The charge is presented in the statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 as an other expense and is a non-cash addback to cash flows from operations.
 
Changes in Management and Board of Directors
 
During 2017, the Company transitioned the finance and accounting function from Fairfield, NJ to the corporate headquarters in Louisville, KY which included hiring Will Logan as VP of Finance. The Company appointed Mr. Logan to the position of Chief Financial Officer effective May 16, 2018. Mr. Logan succeeded John Walpuck, who remained with the Company in his role as Chief Operating Officer throughout 2018.
 
Effective December 31, 2018, the Company entered into a separation agreement with Mr. Walpuck. Mr. Walpuck’s employment agreement was effective for a one-year term, which automatically renewed for additional one-year periods unless either the Company or Mr. Walpuck elected not to extend the employment term, an option which the Company elected and communicated on December 31, 2018. Mr. Walpuck and the Company agreed to a transition of Mr. Walpuck’s duties commencing January 31, 2019. Mr. Walpuck began consulting for the Company commencing February 1, 2019, and such services will end May 1, 2019. Mr. Walpuck will be paid $100 per hour, with a maximum of 80 hours each month during the term.
 
Pursuant to the terms of Mr. Walpuck’s employment agreement, Mr. Walpuck is receiving a total of $220,000 in severance payments in even monthly installments through December 2019. The Company agreed to fully vest all stock options of Mr. Walpuck, such options do not terminate as a result of Mr. Walpuck’s termination of employment and remain exercisable throughout the term of the options. The material terms of Mr. Walpuck’s employment agreement and payments to be made upon termination without “cause” are outlined in Item 13 under the caption “Employment Agreements.”
 
On September 7, 2018, Pat O’Brien and Eric J. Bertrand resigned from the Company’s Board of Directors. Mr. O’Brien had served as a Director since November 2015 and Mr. Bertrand had served as a Director since May 2016. Each resignation was received by the Company in anticipation of the increased commitments required of Directors in anticipation of the Company’s listing on the Nasdaq Capital Markets. There were no changes in the Board of Directors in 2017.
 
Business Strategy
 
We believe that our existing business model is highly scalable and can be expanded successfully as we continue to grow organically and integrate our recent merger transactions, acquire and integrate other companies which operate directly in our target markets, strengthen our operational practices and procedures, further streamline our administrative office functions, and continue to capitalize on various marketing programs and activities.
Industry Background
 
Over approximately the past 18-24 months, we believe certain digital marketing technology industry trends are creating the opportunity for retailers, brands, venue-operators, enterprises, non-profits and other organizations to create innovative shopping, marketing, and informational experiences for their customers and other stakeholders in various venues worldwide. These trends include: (i) the expectations of technology-savvy consumers; (ii) addressing on-line competitors by improving physical experiences; (iii) accelerating decline in the cost of hardware configurations (primarily flat panel displays) and software media players; (iv) the continued evolution of mobile, social, software and hardware technologies, applications and tools; (v) increasing sophistication of social networking platforms; (vi) increasingly complex customer requirements related to their specific digital marketing technology and solution objectives; and (vii) customers challenging service providers with the delivery of a satisfactory consumer experience with the traditional pressure on reducing installation and ongoing operating costs.

As a result, a growing number of retailers, brands, venue-operators and other organizations have identified the need and opportunity to implement increasingly cost-effective and “sales-lifting” digital marketing, and interactive experiences to market to their customers. These experiences include creating unique and customized experiences for targeted, timely offerings and relevant promotions; improving engagement resulting in increased sales; and increasing shopping basket size. We believe our clients consider capitalizing on these industry trends to be increasingly critical to any successful “store of the future” retail and brand sales environment, especially where sales staff turnover is high, training outcomes are inconsistent and product knowledge is low.
 
Companies are accomplishing their strategies by implementing various digital marketing technology solutions, which: are implemented in multiple forms and types of configurations and locations; attempt to achieve any of a broad range of individual or combination of objectives; contain various levels of targeting; have the ability to instantly manage single or multiple locations remotely from a customer’s desktop or other connected device at each location; and are built to deliver or contain a standard or customized experience unique to and within the customer’s environment. Examples of such solutions include:
 

● | Digital Merchandising Systems, which aim to inform and interact with customers through various types of content in an integrated experience, improve in-store customer experiences and increase overall sales, upsells, and/or cross-sales; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Digital Sales Assistants, which aim to replace or augment existing sales resources and the level of interactive and informational sales assistance inside the store; 
● | Digital Way-Finders, which aim to help customers navigate their way around individual retail stores and multi-store locations or venues, or within individual brand categories; 
● | Digital Kiosks, which aim to provide data, specialized and customized broadcasts, promotional information and coupons, train, and other forms of information and interaction with customers in a variety of deployment forms, types, configurations and experiences; 
● | Digital Menu-Board Systems, which aim to enable various types of restaurant operators the ability to remotely and on a scheduled basis, update and modify menu information, promotions, and other forms of content dynamically; 
● | Dynamic Digital Signage which aims to deliver and manage in-store marketing and advertising campaigns, specialized and customized broadcasts, and various other forms of messaging targeting customers in a particular experience or environment. 

Our Markets
 
We currently market and sell our marketing technology solutions through our direct sales force, inside sales team, and word-of-mouth referrals from existing customers. Select strategic partnerships and lead generation programs also drive business to the Company through targeted business development initiatives. We market to companies that seek digital marketing solutions across multiple connected devices and who specifically seek or could benefit from enhancements to the customer experience offered in their stores, venues, brands or organizations.
 
Our digital marketing technology solutions have application in a wide variety of industries. The industries in which we sell our solutions are established and include automotive, apparel & accessories, banking, baby/children, beauty, CPG, department stores, digital out-of-home (“DOOH”), electronics, fashion, fitness, foodservice/quick service restaurant (“QSR”), financial services, gaming, luxury, mass merchants, mobile operators, and pharmacy retail; however, the planning, development, implementation and maintenance of technology-enabled experiences involving combinations of digital marketing technologies is relatively new and evolving.  Moreover, a number of participants in these industries have only recently started considering or expanding the adoption of these types of technologies, solutions and experiences as part of their overall marketing strategies.

Seasonality
 
A portion of our customer activity is influenced by seasonal effects related to traditional end of calendar year peak retail sales periods and other factors that arise from our target customer base. Nevertheless, our revenues can be materially affected by the launch of new markets, the timing of production rollouts, and other factors, any of which have the ability to reduce or outweigh certain seasonal effects.
Effect of General Economic Conditions on our Business
 
We believe that demand for our services will increase in part as a result of new construction and remodeling activities of pre-existing retail, convenience store, stadium and event venues in addition to the recent economic recovery in general. These general economic improvements generally make it easier for our customers to justify decisions to invest in digital marketing technology solutions.
Regulation
 
We are subject to regulation by various federal and state governmental agencies. Such regulation includes radio frequency emission regulatory activities of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, the consumer protection laws of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, product safety regulatory activities of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, and environmental regulation in areas in which we conduct business. Some of the hardware components that we supply to customers may contain hazardous or regulated substances, such as lead. A number of U.S. states have adopted or are considering “takeback” bills addressing the disposal of electronic waste, including CRT style and flat panel monitors and computers. Electronic waste legislation is developing. Some of the bills passed or under consideration may impose on us, or on our customers or suppliers, requirements for disposal of systems we sell and the payment of additional fees to pay costs of disposal and recycling. Presently, we do not believe that any such legislation or proposed legislation will have a materially adverse impact on our business.
Competition 
 
While we believe there is presently no direct competitor with the comprehensive offering of technologies, solutions and services we provide to our customers, there are multiple individual competitors who offer pieces of our solutions. These include digital signage software companies such as Stratacache, Four Winds Interactive, and Reflect Systems; marketing services companies such as Sapient Nitro or digital signage systems integrators such as Convergent Media Systems. Some of these competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do and may be able to respond more rapidly than we can to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements. We believe that our sales and business development capabilities, network operations / field service management capabilities, our comprehensive offering of digital marketing technology and solutions, brand awareness, and proprietary processes are the primary factors affecting our competitive position.
Major Customers
 
Our largest customers account for a majority of our total revenue on a consolidated basis. We had two and three customers that accounted for 48% and 56% of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. One of those customers for the year ended December 31, 2017 was a related party, 33 Degrees. Our Chief Executive Officer, Rick Mills, owns 17.5% of 33 Degrees.
 
We had two customers that in the aggregate accounted for 40% and 63% of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had sales of $1,565,916 and $3,390,148, respectively, with 33 Degrees. 33 Degrees was one of these customers for all periods.
 
Accounts receivable due from 33 Degrees was $1,932,741 and $3,016,646 at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 
Decisions by one or more of these key customers to not renew, terminate or substantially reduce their use of our products, technology, services, and platform could substantially slow our revenue growth and lead to a decline in revenue. Our business plan assumes continued growth in revenue, and it is unlikely that we will become profitable without a continued increase in revenue.
 
Territories
 
We sell products and services primarily throughout North America.
 
Employees
 
We have approximately 120 employees as of December 31, 2018. We do not have any employees that operate under collective-bargaining agreements.
