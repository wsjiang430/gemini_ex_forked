Item 1. Business
General
On October 4, 2004, InvenTrust Properties Corp. was incorporated as Inland American Real Estate Trust, Inc. as a Maryland corporation and has elected to be taxed, and currently qualifies, as a REIT for federal tax purposes. We changed our name to InvenTrust Properties Corp. in April 2015. We were originally formed to own, manage, acquire and develop a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate located throughout the United States, to partially own properties through joint ventures and to own investments in marketable securities and other assets. On February 3, 2015, we completed the spin-off of Xenia Hotels & Resorts, Inc. ("Xenia"), which held our remaining lodging properties. On April 26, 2016, we completed the spin-off of Highlands REIT, Inc. ("Highlands"), which held our remaining non-core properties, and on June 23, 2016, we completed the sale of University House Communities Group, Inc. ("University House"), formerly our student housing platform. The Company is now focused on owning, managing, acquiring, and developing a multi-tenant retail platform. 
Our wholly owned, consolidated, and managed retail properties include grocery-anchored community and neighborhood centers and necessity-based power centers. As of December 31, 2018, we manage 71 retail properties, with a gross leasable area ("GLA") of approximately 12.1 million square feet, which includes one retail property classified as a consolidated variable interest entity ("VIE"), with a GLA of approximately 125,000 square feet, and 13 retail properties with a GLA of approximately 2.6 million square feet owned through an interest in one of our joint ventures, IAGM Retail Fund I, LLC ("IAGM"), an unconsolidated retail joint venture partnership between the Company as 55% owner and PGGM Private Real Estate Fund ("PGGM").
The following table summarizes our multi-tenant retail platform as of December 31, 2018:

 | No. of Properties | GLA(square feet) | Economic Occupancy (a) | ABR per Square Foot (b)
Wholly owned and consolidated | | | | 
Community and neighborhood center (c) | 38 | 4,248,008 | 95.0% | $19.12 
Power center (d) | 20 | 5,227,474 | 94.0% | 16.20 
 | 58 | 9,475,482 | 95.0% | 17.52 
Properties held by IAGM | | | | 
Community and neighborhood center | 7 | 1,266,774 | 95.0% | 18.72 
Power center | 6 | 1,339,040 | 88.0% | 16.92 
 | 13 | 2,605,814 | 92.0% | 17.87 
Multi-tenant retail platform, totals | 71 | 12,081,296 | 94.0% | $17.59 


(a) | Economic occupancy is defined as the percentage of total GLA for which a tenant is obligated to pay rent under the terms of its lease agreement, regardless of the actual use or occupancy by that tenant of the area being leased. Actual use may be less than economic occupancy.


(b) | Annualized Base Rent ("ABR") is computed as revenue for the last month of the period multiplied by twelve months. ABR includes the effect of rent abatements, lease inducements, straight-line rent GAAP adjustments and ground rent income. ABR per square foot is computed as ABR divided by the total leased square footage at the end of the period. Specialty leasing represents leases of less than one year in duration for inline space and includes any term length for a common area space, and is excluded from the ABR and leased square footage figures when computing the ABR per square foot.


(c) | Community and neighborhood centers are generally open-air and designed for tenants that offer a wide array of merchandise including groceries, apparel, other soft goods and convenience-oriented offerings. Our community centers contain large anchor stores and a significant presence of national retail tenants. Our neighborhood shopping centers are generally smaller open-air centers with a grocery store anchor and/or drugstore, and other small service type retailers.


(d) | Power centers are generally larger and consist of several anchors, such as discount department stores, off-price stores, specialty grocers, and warehouse clubs or stores that offer a large selection of merchandise. Typically, the number of specialty tenants is limited and most are national or regional in scope.

Business Objective and Strategy
We are a multi-tenant retail REIT. Our objective is to own and operate the right real estate properties in the right markets. Our strategy to achieve our business objective includes the following:

• | Acquire retail properties in our core markets;


• | Opportunistically dispose of retail properties with maximized values and retail properties not located in our core markets;


• | Pursue re-development opportunities (which may have a mixed-use component) at our current retail properties; and


• | Maintain low leverage and a flexible capital structure.

Acquire retail properties in our core markets. For InvenTrust, the right properties mean open-air grocery anchored and certain necessity-based power centers, and the right markets mean those with above average growth in population, employment and wages. InvenTrust's targeted core markets include those with above average population, employment and wage growth. We believe these conditions create markets that will experience increasing demand for grocery-anchored and necessity-based retail centers which will enable us to capitalize on potential future rent increases while enjoying sustained occupancy at our centers. Using these criteria, we have identified 10 to 15 core markets within the metropolitan areas of Atlanta, Austin, Charlotte, Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, Denver, Houston, the greater Los Angeles and San Diego areas, suburban Washington D.C., Miami, Orlando, Raleigh-Durham, San Antonio and Tampa.
Opportunistically dispose of retail properties with maximized values and retail properties not located in our core markets. We continue to opportunistically dispose of properties in low-growth markets or where we believe the properties' values have been maximized. Additionally, these types of dispositions will allow the Company to re-deploy resources into properties in our core markets.
Pursue re-development opportunities at our current retail properties. We have a coordinated program to increase rental income by maximizing existing re-development opportunities and identifying locations in our current multi-tenant retail platform where we can develop pad sites. In addition, we are working with our tenants to expand rentable square footage at select retail properties where demand warrants. Certain redevelopment opportunities may include a mixed-use component.
Maintain low leverage and a flexible capital structure. We continually evaluate the economic and credit environment and its impact on our business. We believe we are appropriately positioned to have significant liquidity to continue executing on our strategy. We expect to have the ability to repay, refinance or extend any of our debt, and we believe we have adequate sources of funds to meet short-term cash needs related to these refinancings or extensions.
We believe that the continuing refinement of our multi-tenant retail platform will position us for future success and put us in a position to evaluate and ultimately execute on potential strategic transactions aimed at achieving liquidity and providing a return for our stockholders in the long term. While we believe in our ability to execute on our plan, the timing is uncertain and may be shortened or extended by external and macroeconomic factors including, among others, interest rate movements, local, regional, national and global economic performance, competitive factors, the impact of e-commerce on the retail industry, future retailer store closings, retailer bankruptcies, and government policy changes.
Competition
The commercial real estate retail market is highly competitive. We compete for tenants with other owners and operators of commercial rental properties in all of our markets. We compete based on a number of factors that include location, rental rates, suitability of the property’s design to tenants’ needs and the manner in which the property is operated and marketed. The number of competing properties in a particular market could have a material effect on a property’s occupancy levels, rental rates and operating income. We also face significant competition from e-commerce retailers. As retailers increase their e-commerce presence it may cause them to adjust the size or number of brick and mortar retail locations in the future. This shift could adversely impact our occupancy and rental rates, which would, in turn, adversely impact our revenues and cash flows.
We compete with many third parties engaged in real estate investment activities, including other REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, lenders, hedge funds, governmental bodies and other entities. Many real estate investors, including other REITs, have investment objectives similar to ours. In addition, many real estate investors seek financing through the same channels that we do. Therefore, we compete in a market where funds for real estate investment may decrease, grow less than the underlying demand or be unaffordable.

Environmental Matters
Compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws has not had a material adverse effect on our business, assets, or results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay distributions, and we do not believe that our existing platform will require us to incur material expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations. However, we cannot predict the impact of unforeseen environmental contingencies or new or changed laws or regulations on our properties.
Tax Status
We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), beginning with the tax year ended December 31, 2005. Because we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, without the benefit of certain relief provisions, we will be subject to federal and state income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income, property or net worth, respectively, and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 117 employees.
