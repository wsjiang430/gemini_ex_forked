ITEM 1:  BUSINESS
    Unless we have indicated otherwise, or the context otherwise requires, references in this report to “GAMCO Investors, Inc.,” the “Company,” “GBL,” “Gabelli,” “we,” “us,” and “our” or similar terms are to GAMCO Investors, Inc., its predecessors and its subsidiaries.
    Overview
    GAMCO Investors, Inc. (New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”): GBL), a company incorporated under the laws of Delaware, is a widely-recognized provider of investment advisory services to open-end funds, closed-end funds, Exchange Traded Managed Funds (“ETMFs”), and institutional and private wealth management investors principally in the United States.   We generally manage assets on a fully discretionary basis and invest in a variety of U.S. and international securities through various investment styles including value, growth, non-market correlated, and convertible securities.  Our revenues are based primarily on the Company’s levels of assets under management (“AUM”) and fees associated with our various investment products.
 
Since our inception in 1977, we are identified with our research driven approach to equity investing and our proprietary Private Market Value (PMV) with a Catalyst™ investment approach.  
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had $34.4 billion of AUM, of which 94% is invested in equities, principally through our two registered investment advisers: Gabelli Funds, LLC (“Funds Advisor”) and GAMCO Asset Management Inc. (“Institutional and Private Wealth Management”).  G.distributors, LLC (“G.distributors”), our limited purpose broker-dealer subsidiary, acts as an underwriter and distributor of our open-end funds and ETMFs.
 
Our AUM are organized into three groups:
 

· | Open and Closed-End Funds: We provide advisory services to twenty-two open-end funds, sixteen closed-end funds and four exchange traded managed funds under the Gabelli, GAMCO and Comstock brands (collectively, the “Funds”). The Funds had $19.7 billion of AUM on December 31, 2018. Additionally, we provide administrative services to eleven open-end funds, with AUM of $2.0 billion on December 31, 2018, under the TETON Westwood and Keeley brands.

· | Institutional and Private Wealth Management: We provide advisory services to a broad range of investors, including corporate retirement plans, foundations, endowments, jointly-trusteed plans and public funds, private wealth clients and also serve as sub-advisor to third party investment funds including registered investment companies (“Institutional and Private Wealth Management”). On December 31, 2018, we had $14.1 billion of Institutional and Private Wealth Management AUM. Over the last 40 years, the firm has generated over $25.6 billion in investment returns for our institutional and private wealth management clients. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | SICAV: We provide advisory services to one fund under the GAMCO brand, the GAMCO International SICAV (the “SICAV”). The SICAV has two sub-fund strategies, the GAMCO Merger Arbitrage Fund and the GAMCO All Cap Value Fund. The GAMCO Merger Arbitrage strategy is sub-advised by Associated Capital Group, Inc. (“AC”) and had $477 million of AUM at December 31, 2018. The GAMCO All Cap Value strategy had $30 million of AUM on December 31, 2018. 

 
GBL is a holding company incorporated in April 1998 in advance of our initial public offering (“Offering”) in February 1999.  GGCP Holdings, LLC, a subsidiary of GGCP, Inc. (“GGCP”), which is majority-owned by Mr. Mario J. Gabelli (“Mr. Gabelli”), owns a majority of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock (“Class B Stock”) of GBL.  Such ownership represented approximately 91% of the combined voting power of the outstanding common stock and approximately 63% of the equity interest on December 31, 2018.   On December 31, 2018, AC and its subsidiaries, own 3,016,501 shares of Class A Common Stock (“Class A Stock”) representing approximately 10% of the equity interest and approximately 2% of the combined voting power.  AC is majority-owned by GGCP Holdings, LLC.  Accordingly, Mr. Gabelli is deemed to control GBL.
 
Our executive offices are located at 140 Greenwich Ave., Greenwich, CT, 06830 and One Corporate Center, Rye, New York 10580.  Our telephone number is (203) 629-2726.  We post or provide a link on our website, www.gabelli.com, to the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission” or “SEC”): our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  All such filings on our website are available free of charge.
 
On March 20, 2009, we distributed our ownership in Teton Advisors, Inc. (“Teton”), the advisor to the TETON Westwood funds, to our shareholders.  At the time of the distribution the stock price of Teton was $2.75 per share.  At December 31, 2018 the stock price of Teton was $51.65 per share.
 
On November 30, 2015 (the “Spin-Off Date”), we distributed our ownership in AC along with certain cash and other assets to our shareholders (the “Spin-off”).  AC owns and operates, directly or indirectly, the alternatives and the institutional research businesses previously owned and operated by GBL.  Subsequent to the Spin-off, GAMCO no longer consolidates the financial results of AC for the purposes of its own financial reporting and the historical financial results of AC have been reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for 2015 within this report.  Historical AUM have similarly been adjusted to remove AUM managed by AC.  At the time of the distribution, the stock price of AC was $29.50 per share.  At December 31, 2018, the stock price of AC was $35.23 per share.
 
During 2018, we returned $12.9 million to shareholders through dividends and our stock buyback program.  We paid $2.3 million, or $0.08 per share, in cash dividends to our common shareholders and repurchased 419,995 shares at an average investment of $25.25 per share or $10.6 million.
 
Since the Offering in February 1999, when GBL shares were sold at $17.50 per share and total shares outstanding were 30 million for a market capitalization of $525 million, we have returned to shareholders $2.0 billion in total, of which $1.0 billion was in the form of spin-offs of AC and Teton, $493.3 million was from dividends and $463.7 million was through stock buybacks.
 
Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG)
 
As part of GAMCO’s stewardship of investments on behalf of clients, we have historically viewed Governance, active ownership, proxy voting and engagement as important ways to protect shareholder value.  To that end, the firm has been a leading voice on certain governance matters since May 1988 when it initiated its Magna Carta of Shareholder Rights.  We actively vote our own proxies and regularly file shareholder proposals on issues that we believe increase shareholder value.  Such activity is part of our incorporation of Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) considerations as long term investors.
 

 5
 
Since its formation in April 1989, the Proxy Voting Committee of the Company has formulated guidelines and reviewed proxy statements for the purpose of determining how to vote proxies related to portfolio securities held by our clients.  The main driver of these guidelines is to vote in the best economic interest of our clients.  As we state in our Magna Carta of Shareholder Rights, we are neither for or against management.  We are for shareholders.  We do not consider any issue routine.  We take into consideration all of our research on the company, its directors, and their short and long-term goals for the company.  In cases where issues that we generally do not approve of are combined with other issues, the negative aspects of the issues will be factored into the evaluation of the overall proposals but will not necessitate a vote in opposition to the overall proposals.
 
Giving Back
 
Our firm has long held the belief that generating returns for our stakeholders, while important, is not the only factor in measuring our corporate success.  To underscore our principle, we have been involved in the field of responsible investing since 1987. 
 
One of the ways in which we, as a Firm, give back is through our Shareholder Designated Charitable Contribution Program that we established in 2013.  In our program of corporate giving, GAMCO shareholders select which organizations will be recipients of charitable grants.  In May 2018, the Board approved a $0.20 per share designation for shareholders of record on June 30th.  For this distribution a majority of our shareholders registered their shares and we were able to distribute $4.9 million to numerous 501(c)(3) organizations designated by our shareholders.  In November 2018, the Board approved an additional $0.20 per share designation for shareholders of record as of December 31, 2018.  Based on the number of shareholders who qualified for this designation, we expect that we will distribute an additional $4.8 million.  Since the inception of this program our shareholders have designated approximately $27 million to over 150 charities across the United States, which brings the total charitable contributions since our IPO to $52 million.
 
Business Strategy
 
Our business strategy targets global growth of the franchise through continued leveraging of our proven asset management strengths including our brands, long-term performance record, diverse product offerings and experienced investment, research and client relationship professionals.  In order to achieve performance and growth in AUM and profitability, we are pursuing a strategy which includes the following key elements:

· | Gabelli “Private Market Value (PMV) with a CatalystTM” Investment Approach. While we have expanded our investment product offerings, our “value investing” approach remains the core of our business. This method is based on and has evolved from the value investing principles articulated by Graham & Dodd in 1934 and enhanced by Roger Murray and Bruce Greenwald, and has been further augmented by Mr. Gabelli, CFA, with his development in 1979 of Private Market Value (PMV) with a CatalystTM value investment methodology. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Private Market Value (PMV) with a CatalystTM investing is a disciplined, research-driven approach based on intensive security analysis. In this process, we generally select stocks whose intrinsic value, based on our estimate of current asset value and future growth and earnings power, is significantly different from the value reflected in the public market. We then calculate the stock’s PMV, which is defined as the price an informed industrial buyer would likely pay to acquire the business. In general, our Institutional and Private Wealth Management AUM are managed to meet the specific needs and objectives of each client by utilizing investment strategies that are within our areas of expertise: “all cap value”, “ESG”, “small cap value”, “large cap growth”, “international growth” and “convertible”. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Establishing Relationship Offices. We have eight offices including New York, Chicago, Greenwich, London, Morristown, Palm Beach, Reno, and Tokyo. We will continue to evaluate adding additional offices throughout the world. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Incentive Fees. As of December 31, 2018, approximately $1.8 billion of our AUM are managed on a performance fee basis including $661 million of preferred issues of closed-end funds, $507 million of SICAV assets, $315 million in The GDL Fund, $192 million of Institutional and Private Wealth Management assets, and $100 million in the Gabelli Merger Plus+ Trust Plc. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expanding Mutual Fund Distribution. We continue to expand our distribution network primarily through national and regional brokerage firms and have developed additional classes of shares for most of our mutual funds for sale through these firms and other third party distribution channels. We have increased our wholesaling efforts to market the multi-class shares, which have been designed to meet the needs of investors who seek advice through financial consultants. We launched our first actively managed exchange traded managed fund in 2016 (The Gabelli Media Mogul NextSharesTM), our second in 2017 (The Gabelli Food of All Nations NextSharesTM) and two additional funds in 2018 (The Gabelli RBI NextSharesTM and The Gabelli Pet Parents’TM NextSharesTM).

· | Increasing Presence in Private Wealth Management Market. Our private wealth management business focuses, in general, on serving clients who have established an account relationship of $2.5 million or more with us. According to industry estimates, the number of households with over $2.5 million in investable assets will continue to grow, subject to ups and downs in the equity and fixed income markets. With our 41-year history of serving this segment, long-term performance record, customized portfolios tax-sensitive investment strategy, brand name recognition and broad array of product offerings, we believe that we are well-positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities in this market. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Increasing Marketing for Institutional and Private Wealth Management. The Institutional and Private Wealth Management business was principally developed through direct marketing channels. We plan to augment our institutional sales force through the addition of staff to market directly to the consultant community as well as through our traditional marketing channels. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Attracting and Retaining Experienced Professionals. We offer significant variable compensation that provides opportunities to our staff. The ability to attract and retain highly-experienced investment and other professionals with a long-term commitment to us and our clients has been, and will continue to be, a significant factor in our long-term growth. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Hosting of Institutional Investor Symposiums. We have a tradition of sponsoring institutional investor symposiums that bring together prominent portfolio managers, members of academia and other leading business professionals to present, discuss and debate current issues and topics in the investment industry. These symposiums have included: 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-2001 -1998 | “Virtues of Value Investing” “The Role of Hedge Funds as a Way of Generating Absolute Returns”
-1997 | “Active vs. Passive Stock Selection” 


· | Capitalizing on Acquisitions, Alliances and Lift-outs. We intend to selectively and opportunistically pursue acquisitions, alliances and lift-outs that will broaden our product offerings and add new sources of distribution. In May 2000, we added Comstock Partners Funds, Inc., (renamed Comstock Funds, Inc.). The Comstock funds are part of our Non-Market Correlated mutual fund product line. In November 2002, we completed our alliance with Woodland Partners LLC, a Minneapolis-based investment advisor focused on investing in small capitalization companies. On March 11, 2008, Funds Advisor assumed the role of investment advisor to the AXA Enterprise Mergers and Acquisitions Fund, subsequently renamed Gabelli Enterprise Mergers and Acquisitions Fund, a fund that had been sub-advised by GAMCO since the fund’s inception on February 28, 2001. On August 1, 2010, the clients of Florida-based NMF Asset Management became part of the Institutional and Private Wealth Management operation of GAMCO Asset Management Inc. (“GAMCO Asset”). On November 2, 2015, the investment team of Dinsmore Capital, a specialist in convertible bond investing and formerly the manager of The Bancroft Fund and the Ellsworth Growth & Income Fund joined Funds Advisor. During 2018, the clients of Trevor, Stewart, Burton & Jacobsen and Loeb Partners Corporation joined GAMCO Asset.

We believe that our growth to date is traceable to the following factors:
      
● | Strong Industry Fundamentals: According to data compiled by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the investment management industry has grown faster than more traditional segments of the financial services industry, including the banking and insurance industries. Since GBL began managing assets for institutional and private wealth management clients in 1977, world equity markets have grown at a 9.6% compound annual growth rate through December 31, 2018 to approximately $69.6 trillion(a). The U.S. equity market comprises about $26.9 trillion(a) or roughly 39% of world equity markets. We believe that demographic trends and the growing role of money managers in the placement of capital compared to the traditional role played by banks and life insurance companies will result in continued growth of the investment management industry. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Long-Term Performance: We have a superior long-term record of achieving relatively high returns for our Institutional and Private Wealth Management clients. We believe that our performance record represents a competitive advantage and a recognized component of our franchise.

Business Description
    Our AUM’s are clustered in two groups:  Funds and Institutional & Private Wealth Management.
 
Funds:  We provide advisory services to twenty-two open-end funds, sixteen closed-end funds and four actively managed exchange traded managed funds.  At December 31, 2018, we had $19.7 billion of AUM in Fund AUM, representing 57.3% of our total AUM.  Our equity funds and closed-end funds were $17.5 billion in AUM on December 31, 2018, 19.7% below the $21.8 billion on December 31, 2017.  We also are the advisor to a SICAV with AUM of $507 million at December 31, 2018, compared to the $510 million in AUM at December 31, 2017.
Open-end Funds
 
On December 31, 2018, we had $10.6 billion of AUM in twenty-one open-end equity funds and $2.2 billion in our Gabelli U.S. Treasury Money Market Fund.  We market our open-end funds primarily through third party distribution programs, including no-transaction fee (“NTF”) programs, and have developed additional share classes for many of our funds for distribution through additional third party distribution channels.  At December 31, 2018, third party distribution programs accounted for approximately 76% of all assets in open-end equity funds, and, approximately 24% of our AUM in open-end equity funds were sourced through direct sales relationships.
Closed-end Funds
 
We act as investment advisor to sixteen closed-end funds, fourteen of which trade on the NYSE or its affiliated exchange: Gabelli Equity Trust (GAB), GDL Fund (GDL), Gabelli Multimedia Trust (GGT), Gabelli Healthcare & Wellness Rx Trust (GRX), Gabelli Convertible and Income Securities Fund (GCV), Gabelli Utility Trust (GUT), Gabelli Dividend & Income Trust (GDV), Gabelli Global Utility & Income Trust (GLU), GAMCO Global Gold, Natural Resources & Income Trust (GGN), GAMCO Natural Resources, Gold & Income Trust (GNT), The Gabelli Global Small and Mid Cap Value Trust (GGZ), the Bancroft Fund Ltd. (BCV), the Ellsworth Growth and Income Fund Ltd. (ECF), and the Gabelli Go Anywhere Trust (GGO).  We launched the Gabelli Value Plus+ Trust Plc (GVP) in 2015 and the Gabelli Merger Plus+ Trust Plc (GMP) in 2017, both of which trade on the London Stock Exchange.  As of December 31, 2018, the sixteen closed-end funds had total assets of $7.0 billion, representing 35.2% of the total assets in our Funds business.

Exchange Traded Managed Funds
 
During 2016, we launched our first exchange traded managed fund.  The Gabelli Media Mogul NextSharesTM trades on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the symbol “MOGLC” and was the first member of the Gabelli NextShares Trust offered under an agreement with NextShares Solutions, LLC.  The Gabelli Food of All Nations NextSharesTM was launched in 2017 and trades on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the symbol “FOANC”.  During 2018, we launched The Gabelli RBI NextSharesTM which trades under the symbol “GRBIC” and The Gabelli Pet Parents’TM NextSharesTM which trades under the symbol “PETZC”.  As of December 31, 2018, the four ETMFs had AUM of $8.6 million.  On November 14, 2018, the Board of Trustees for each of the Gabelli Media Mogul NextSharesTM and the Gabelli Pet Parents’TM NextSharesTM determined that it would be in the best interest of shareholders of the funds to approve an agreement and plan of reorganization and termination for each fund, pursuant to which substantially all of the assets and liabilities of each fund would be transferred to a new series of a new trust to be created at a future date and shareholders of the funds would become shareholders of the new funds.  It is expected that each new fund will be structured and operate as a no-load, open-end mutual fund registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, instead of an exchange traded managed fund.  In February 2019, the Board of Trustees of the NextSharesTM funds approved a plan of liquidation for the Gabelli Food of All Nations NextSharesTM and the Gabelli RBI NextSharesTM, pursuant to which each fund will be liquidated on or about March 28, 2019.
SICAV
 
We provide advisory services to one fund under the GAMCO brand, the GAMCO International SICAV.  The SICAV has two sub-fund strategies, the GAMCO Merger Arbitrage Fund and the GAMCO All Cap Value Fund.  Total AUM in the SICAV was $507 million at December 31, 2018.
 
Institutional and Private Wealth Management:   At December 31, 2018, we had $14.1 billion of AUM in approximately 1,600 Institutional and Private Wealth Management accounts, representing 41.0% of our total AUM.  The Private Wealth Management clients – defined as individuals generally having minimum investable assets of $2.5 million comprised approximately 81% of the total number of management accounts and approximately $3.8 billion, or 27%, of the Institutional and Private Wealth Management assets as of December 31, 2018.  We believe that Private Wealth Management clients for the taxable portion of their assets are attracted to us by our returns and the tax efficient nature of the underlying investment process.  As of December 31, 2018, institutional client accounts represented approximately $4.8 billion, or 34%, of the Institutional and Private Wealth Management assets and 9% of the accounts.  Foundation and endowment fund assets represented 10% of the number of Institutional and Private Wealth Management accounts and approximately $1.2 billion, or 8%, of the Institutional and Private Wealth Management AUM.  The sub-advisory clients, (where we act as sub-advisor to third party investment funds) held approximately $4.3 billion, or 31%, of total Institutional and Private Wealth Management assets with 1% of the total number of accounts.
 
The ten largest Institutional and Private Wealth Management relationships comprised approximately 48% of GAMCO Asset Management AUM and approximately 20% of our total AUM and approximately 27% of GAMCO Asset Management revenues and approximately 8% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018.
 
Investment advisory agreements for our Institutional and Private Wealth Management clients are typically subject to termination by the client without penalty on 30 days’ notice or less.

Additional Information on Mutual Funds
 
Through Funds Advisor, we act as advisor to all of the Funds, except with respect to the GAMCO Mathers Fund for which GAMCO Asset Management Inc. acted as the advisor.
 
Shareholders of the open-end funds are allowed to exchange shares among the same class of shares of the other open-end funds as economic and market conditions and investor needs change at no additional cost.  However, as noted below, certain open-end funds impose a 2% redemption fee on shares redeemed within seven days or less after a purchase.  We periodically introduce new funds designed to complement and expand our investment product offerings, respond to competitive developments in the financial marketplace and meet the changing needs of investors.
 
Our marketing efforts for the open-end funds are currently focused on increasing the distribution and sales of our existing funds as well as creating new products for sale through our distribution channels.  We believe that our marketing efforts for the funds will continue to generate additional revenues from investment advisory fees.  We had traditionally distributed most of our open-end funds by using a variety of direct response marketing techniques, including telemarketing and advertising, and as a result we maintain direct relationships with many of our no-load open-end fund shareholders.  Beginning in late 1995, we expanded our product distribution by offering several of our open-end funds through third party distribution programs, including NTF programs.  In 1998 and 1999, we further expanded these efforts to include substantially all of our open-end funds in third party distribution programs.  Approximately 24% of the AUM in the open-end equity funds are still attributable to our direct response marketing efforts.  Third party distribution programs have become an increasingly important source of asset growth for us.  Of the $10.6 billion of AUM in the open-end equity funds as of December 31, 2018, approximately 76% were generated through third party distribution programs.  We are responsible for paying the service and distribution fees charged by many of the third party distribution programs, although a portion of such service fees under certain circumstances are payable by the funds.  The multi-class shares are available in all of the Gabelli Funds, with the exception of the Gabelli Capital Asset Fund.  We believe that the use of multi-class shares expands the distribution of our open-end funds into the advised sector of the mutual fund investment community.  We introduced Class I shares, which are no-load shares with higher minimum initial investment and without distribution fees available directly through G.distributors or through brokers that have entered into selling agreements with respect to Class I shares.  The no-load shares are designated as Class AAA shares and are available for new and current investors.  In general, distribution through third party programs has greater variable cost components and lower fixed cost components than distribution through our traditional direct sales methods.
 
We provide investment advisory and management services pursuant to an investment management agreement with each fund.  The investment management agreements with the funds generally provide that we are responsible for the overall investment and administrative services, subject to the oversight of each fund's Board of Directors or Trustees and in accordance with each fund's fundamental investment objectives and policies.  The investment management agreements permit us to enter into separate agreements for sub-administrative and accounting services on behalf of the respective funds.

Our affiliated advisor provides the funds with administrative services pursuant to the management contracts.  Such services include, without limitation, supervision of the calculation of net asset value, preparation of financial reports for shareholders of the funds, internal accounting, tax accounting and reporting, regulatory filings and other services.  Most of these administrative services are provided through sub-contracts with independent third parties.  Transfer agency and custodial services are provided directly to the funds by independent third parties.
 
Our funds’ investment management agreements may continue in effect from year to year only if specifically approved at least annually by (i) the fund's Board of Directors or Trustees or (ii) the fund's shareholders and, in either case, the vote of a majority of the fund's independent or non-interested directors or trustees who are not parties to the agreement or “interested persons” of any such party, within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940 as amended (the “Company Act”).  Each fund may terminate its investment management agreement at any time upon 60 days' written notice by (i) a vote of the majority of the Board of Directors or Trustees cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such termination or (ii) a vote at a meeting of shareholders of the lesser of either 67% of the voting shares represented in person or by proxy (if at least 50% of the shares are present at the meeting) or 50% of the outstanding voting shares of such Fund.  Each investment management agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment, as defined in the Company Act.  We may terminate an investment management agreement without penalty on 60 days' written notice.
 
Open-End Fund Distribution
 
G.distributors, a wholly-owned subsidiary of GBL, is a broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is regulated by FINRA.  G.distributors' revenues are derived primarily from the distribution of our open-end funds.  G.distributors distributes our open-end funds pursuant to distribution agreements with each fund.  It also distributes funds managed by Teton and its affiliates.  Under each distribution agreement with an open-end fund, G.distributors offers and sells such open-end fund's shares on a continuous basis and pays the majority of the costs of marketing and selling the shares, including printing and mailing prospectuses and sales literature, advertising and maintaining sales and customer service personnel and sales and services fulfillment systems, and payments to the sponsors of third party distribution programs, financial intermediaries and G.distributors sales personnel.  G.distributors receives fees for such services pursuant to distribution plans adopted under provisions of Rule 12b-1 (“12b-1”) of the Company Act.  Distribution fees from the open-end funds are computed daily based on average net assets.  Distribution fees from the open-end funds amounted to $35.1 million, $39.7 million and $41.0 million while payments to third-parties for selling the open-end funds totaled $32.3 million, $37.3 million and $39.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  G.distributors is the principal underwriter for funds distributed in multiple classes of shares which carry either a front-end, back-end or no sales charge.  Underwriting fees and sales charges retained amounted to $0.9 million, $1.5 million and $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
Under the distribution plans, the open-end Class AAA shares of the funds (except The Gabelli U.S. Treasury Money Market Fund, Gabelli Capital Asset Fund and The Gabelli ABC Fund) and the Class A and ADV shares of various funds pay G.distributors a distribution or service fee of .25% per year (except the Class A shares of the TETON Westwood Funds and Gabelli Enterprise Mergers & Acquisition Fund which pay .50% and 0.45% per year, respectively, and the TETON Westwood Intermediate Bond Fund which pays .35%) on the average daily net assets of the fund.  Class C shares have a 12b-1 distribution plan with a service and distribution fee totaling 1%.   G.distributors’ distribution agreements with the funds may continue in effect from year to year only if specifically approved at least annually by (i) the fund's Board of Directors or Trustees or (ii) the fund's shareholders and, in either case, the vote of a majority of the fund's directors or trustees who are not parties to the agreement or “interested persons” of any such party, within the meaning of the Company Act.  Each fund may terminate its distribution agreement, or any agreement thereunder, at any time upon 60 days' written notice by (i) a vote of the majority of its directors or trustees cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such termination or (ii) a vote at a meeting of shareholders of the lesser of either 67% of the voting shares represented in person or by proxy (if at least 50% of the shares are present at the meeting) or 50% of the outstanding voting shares of such fund. Each distribution agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment, as defined in the Company Act.  G.distributors may terminate a distribution agreement without penalty upon 60 days' written notice.
 
G.distributors also offers our open-end fund products through our website, www.gabelli.com, where directly registered mutual fund investors can access their personal account information and buy, sell, and exchange Fund shares.  Fund prospectuses, quarterly reports, fund applications, daily net asset values and performance charts are all available online.

Competition
 
We compete with other investment management firms and mutual fund companies, insurance companies, banks, brokerage firms and other financial institutions that offer products that have similar features and investment objectives.  Many of these investment management firms are subsidiaries of large diversified financial companies.  Many others are much larger in terms of AUM and revenues and, accordingly, have much larger sales organizations and marketing budgets.  Historically, we have competed primarily on the basis of the long-term investment performance of many of our investment products.  However, we have taken steps to increase our distribution channels, brand name awareness and marketing efforts.  Other trends affecting the investment management business includes the widespread popularity of exchange traded products which have tax and cost advantages over traditional investment companies.
 
The market for providing investment management services to Institutional and Private Wealth Management clients is also highly competitive.  Approximately 33% of our investment advisory fee revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was derived from our Institutional and Private Wealth Management business.  Selection of investment advisors by U.S. institutional investors is often subject to a screening process and to favorable recommendations by investment industry consultants.  Many of these investors require their investment advisors to have a successful and sustained performance record, often five years or longer with focus also on one-year and three-year performance records.  We have significantly increased our AUM on behalf of U.S. institutional investors since our entry into the institutional asset management business in 1977.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Service marks and brand name recognition are important to our business.  We have rights to the service marks under which our products are offered.  We have registered certain service marks in the United States and will continue to do so as new trademarks and service marks are developed or acquired.  We have rights to use the “Gabelli” name, the “GAMCO” name, and other names.  Pursuant to an assignment agreement, Mr. Gabelli has assigned to us all of his rights, title and interests in and to the “Gabelli” name for use in connection with investment management services, mutual funds and securities brokerage services.  However, under the agreement, Mr. Gabelli will retain any and all rights, title and interests he has or may have in the “Gabelli” name for use in connection with (i) charitable foundations controlled by Mr. Gabelli or members of his family and (ii) entities engaged in private investment activities for Mr. Gabelli or members of his family.  In addition, the funds managed by Mr. Gabelli outside GBL have entered into a license agreement with us permitting them to continue limited use of the “Gabelli” name under specified circumstances.  We have taken, and will continue to take, action to protect our interests in these service marks.
Regulation
 
Virtually all aspects of our businesses are subject to various federal, state and foreign laws and regulations.  These laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients and shareholders of investment funds. Under such laws and regulations, agencies that regulate investment advisors and broker-dealers have broad powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit such an advisor or broker-dealer from carrying on its business in the event that it fails to comply with such laws and regulations.  In such an event, the possible sanctions that may be imposed include civil and criminal liability, the suspension of individual employees, injunctions, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of the investment advisor and other registrations, censures, and fines.
 
Our business is subject to extensive regulation at the federal, state and foreign level by the SEC and other regulatory bodies.  Certain of our subsidiaries are registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”), and the funds are registered with the SEC under the Company Act.  We also have a subsidiary that is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC and is subject to regulation by FINRA and various states.
 
The subsidiaries of GBL that are registered with the Commission under the Advisers Act (Funds Advisor, Gabelli Fixed Income LLC and GAMCO Asset) are regulated by and subject to examination by the SEC.  The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisors including fiduciary duties, disclosure obligations and record keeping, operational and marketing requirements.  The Commission is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act, ranging from censure to termination of an investment advisor's registration.  The failure of an advisory subsidiary to comply with the requirements of the SEC could have a material adverse effect on us.
 
We derive a substantial majority of our revenues from investment advisory services through our various investment management agreements.  Under the Advisers Act, our investment management agreements may not be assigned without the client's consent.  Under the Company Act, advisory agreements with registered investment companies such as our Funds terminate automatically upon assignment.  The term “assignment” is broadly defined and includes direct as well as assignments that may be deemed to occur, under certain circumstances, upon the transfer, directly or indirectly, of a controlling interest in GBL.

In its capacity as a broker-dealer, G.distributors is required to maintain certain minimum net capital amounts.  These requirements also provide that equity capital may not be withdrawn, advances to affiliates may not be made or cash dividends paid if certain minimum net capital requirements are not met.  G.distributors’ net capital, as defined, met or exceeded all minimum requirements as of December 31, 2018.  As a registered broker-dealer, G.distributors is also subject to periodic examination by FINRA, the SEC and the states.
 
Subsidiaries of GBL are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), and to regulations promulgated thereunder, insofar as they are “fiduciaries” under ERISA with respect to certain of their clients. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA and prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients.  Our failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on us.
 
Investments by GBL and on behalf of our advisory clients and investment funds often represent a significant equity ownership position in an issuer's class of stock.  As of December 31, 2018, we had five percent or more beneficial ownership with respect to 102 equity securities.  This activity raises frequent regulatory, legal, and disclosure issues regarding our aggregate beneficial ownership level with respect to portfolio securities, including issues relating to issuers' shareholder rights plans or “poison pills,” and various federal and state regulatory limitations, including state gaming laws and regulations, federal communications laws and regulations and federal and state public utility laws and regulations, as well as federal proxy rules governing shareholder communications and federal laws and regulations regarding the reporting of beneficial ownership positions.  Foreign country regulations may have different levels of ownership limitations.  Our failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on us.
 
The USA Patriot Act of 2001 contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and mandates the implementation of various new regulations applicable to broker-dealers, mutual funds and other financial services companies, including standards for verifying client identification at account opening, and obligations to monitor client transactions and report suspicious activities.  Anti-money laundering laws outside of the U.S. contain some similar provisions.  Our failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on us.
 
We and certain of our affiliates are subject to the laws of non-U.S. jurisdictions and non-U.S. regulatory agencies or bodies.  In connection with our office in London and our plans to market certain products in Europe, we are required to comply with the laws of the United Kingdom and other European countries regarding these activities.  Our subsidiary, GAMCO Asset Management (UK) Limited, is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”).  In connection with our registration in the United Kingdom, we have minimum capital requirements that have been consistently met or exceeded.  We opened an office in Tokyo and therefore are subject to national and local laws in that jurisdiction.  We are subject to requirements in numerous jurisdictions regarding reporting of beneficial ownership positions in securities issued by companies whose securities are publicly-traded in those countries.
 
Regulatory matters
 
The investment management industry is likely to continue facing a high level of regulatory scrutiny and become subject to additional rules designed to increase disclosure, tighten controls and reduce potential conflicts of interest.  In addition, the Commission has substantially increased its use of focused inquiries which request information from investment advisors and a number of fund complexes regarding particular practices or provisions of the securities laws.  We participate in some of these inquiries in the normal course of our business.  Changes in laws, regulations and administrative practices by regulatory authorities, and the associated compliance costs, have increased our cost structure and could in the future have a material adverse impact.  Although we have installed procedures and utilize the services of experienced administrators, accountants and lawyers to assist us in adhering to regulatory guidelines and satisfying these requirements, and maintain insurance to protect ourselves in the case of client losses, there can be no assurance that the precautions and procedures that we have instituted and installed, or the insurance that we maintain to protect ourselves in case of client losses, will protect us from all potential liabilities.
