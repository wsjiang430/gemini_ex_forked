The acquisition is subject to required regulatory approvals and other customary conditions of closing and is anticipated to take place in the second quarter of 2019. Upon closing of the transaction, the branches of FNB, along with the Bank’s four existing branches operating in Utah, will operate as a new division of the Bank. 
See Notes 22 and 23 in the Consolidated Financial Statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional information regarding these acquisitions.
Market Area and Competition
The Company and the Bank have 167 locations, which consists of 149 branches and 18 loan or administration offices, in 63 counties within 7 states including Montana, Idaho, Utah, Washington, Wyoming, Colorado, and Arizona. The market area’s economic base primarily focuses on tourism, construction, mining, energy, manufacturing, agriculture, service industry, and health care. The tourism industry is highly influenced by national parks, ski resorts, significant lakes and rural scenic areas.
Commercial banking is a highly competitive business and operates in a rapidly changing environment. There are a large number of depository institutions including savings and loans, commercial banks, and credit unions in the markets in which the Company has locations. Competition is also increasing for deposit and lending services from internet-based competitors. Non-depository financial service institutions, primarily in the securities, insurance and retail industries, have also become competitors for retail savings, investment funds and lending activities. In addition to offering competitive interest rates, the principal methods used by the Bank to attract deposits include the offering of a variety of services including on-line banking, mobile banking and convenient office locations and business hours. The primary factors in competing for loans are interest rates and rate adjustment provisions, loan maturities, loan fees, and the quality of service.

Copies of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge through the Company’s website (www.glacierbancorp.com) as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company has filed the material with, or furnished it to, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Copies can also be obtained by accessing the SEC’s website (www.sec.gov).
Supervision and Regulation
The Company and the Bank are subject to extensive regulation under federal and state laws. This section provides a general overview of the federal and state regulatory framework applicable to the Company and the Bank. In general, this regulatory framework is designed to protect depositors, the federal Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”), and the federal and state banking system as a whole, rather than specifically for the protection of shareholders. Note that this section is not intended to summarize all laws and regulations applicable to the Company and the Bank. Descriptions of statutory or regulatory provisions do not purport to be complete and are qualified by reference to those provisions. 
These statutes and regulations, as well as related policies, continue to be subject to change by Congress, state legislatures, and federal and state regulators. Changes in statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies applicable to the Company and the Bank (including their interpretation or implementation) cannot be predicted and could have a material effect on the Company’s and the Bank’s business and operations. Numerous changes to the statutes, regulations, and regulatory policies applicable to the Company and the Bank have been made or proposed in recent years. Continued efforts to monitor and comply with new regulatory requirements add to the complexity and cost of the Company’s and the Bank's business and operations.
6

The Company is subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve (as a bank holding company) and regulation by the State of Montana (as a Montana corporation). The Company is also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, both as administered by the SEC. The Bank is subject to regulation and supervision by the FDIC, the Montana Department of Administration's Banking and Financial Institutions Division, and, with respect to Bank branches outside of the State of Montana, the respective regulators in those states.
Federal Bank Holding Company Regulation
General. The Company is a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHCA”), due to its ownership of and control over the Bank. As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve. In general, the BHCA limits the business of a bank holding company to owning or controlling banks and engaging in, or retaining or acquiring shares in a company engaged in, other activities closely related to the business of banking. In addition, the Company must also file reports with and provide additional information to the Federal Reserve.
Holding Company Bank Ownership. The BHCA requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before: 1) acquiring, directly or indirectly, ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, it would own or control more than 5 percent of such shares; 2) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company; or 3) merging or consolidating with another bank holding company.
Holding Company Control of Non-banks. With some exceptions, the BHCA prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring or retaining direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5 percent of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company, or from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or providing services for its subsidiaries. The principal exceptions to these prohibitions involve certain non-bank activities that, by federal statute, agency regulation, or order, have been identified as activities closely related to the business of banking or managing or controlling banks.
Transactions with Affiliates. Bank subsidiaries of a bank holding company are subject to restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on extensions of credit to the holding company or its subsidiaries, on investments in securities, and on the use of securities as collateral for loans to any borrower. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Dodd-Frank Act”) further extended the definition of an “affiliate” and treats credit exposure arising from derivative transactions, securities lending, and borrowing transactions as covered transactions under the regulations. It also 1) expands the scope of covered transactions required to be collateralized; 2) requires collateral to be maintained at all times for covered transactions required to be collateralized; and 3) places limits on acceptable collateral. These regulations and restrictions may limit the Company’s ability to obtain funds from the Bank for its cash needs, including funds for payments of dividends, interest, and operational expenses.
Tying Arrangements. The Company is prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit, sale or lease of property, or furnishing of services. For example, with certain exceptions, neither the Company nor the Bank may condition an extension of credit to a customer on either 1) a requirement that the customer obtain additional services provided by the Company or the Bank; or 2) an agreement by the customer to refrain from obtaining other services from a competitor.
Support of Bank Subsidiaries. Under Federal Reserve policy and the Dodd-Frank Act, the Company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to the Bank. This means that the Company is required to commit, as necessary, capital and resources to support the Bank, including at times when the Company may not be in a financial position to provide such resources or when it may not be in the Company's or its shareholders' best interests to do so. Any capital loans a bank holding company makes to its bank subsidiaries are subordinate to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the bank subsidiaries.
State Law Restrictions. As a Montana corporation, the Company is subject to certain limitations and restrictions under applicable Montana corporate law. For example, Montana corporate law includes limitations and restrictions relating to indemnification of directors, distributions to shareholders, transactions involving directors, officers, or interested shareholders, maintenance of books, records, and minutes, and observance of certain corporate formalities.
Federal and State Regulation of the Bank
General. Deposits in the Bank are insured by the FDIC. The Bank is subject to primary supervision, periodic examination, and regulation of the FDIC and the Montana Department of Administration's Banking and Financial Institutions Division. These agencies have the authority to prohibit the Bank from engaging in what they believe constitutes unsafe or unsound banking practices. The federal laws that apply to the Bank regulate, among other things, the scope of its business, its investments, its reserves against deposits, the timing of the availability of deposited funds, and the nature, amount of, and collateral for loans. Federal laws also regulate community reinvestment and insider credit transactions and impose safety and soundness standards. In addition to federal law and the laws of the State of Montana, with respect to the Bank's branches in Idaho, Utah, Washington, Wyoming, Colorado and Arizona, the Bank is also subject to the various laws and regulations governing its activities in those states.
7

Consumer Protection. The Bank is subject to a variety of federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations that govern its relationships and interactions with consumers, including laws and regulations that impose certain disclosure requirements and that govern the manner in which the Bank takes deposits, makes and collects loans, and provides other services. In recent years, examination and enforcement by federal and state banking agencies for non-compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations have increased and become more intense. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may subject the Bank to various penalties, including but not limited to enforcement actions, injunctions, fines, civil monetary penalties, criminal penalties, punitive damages, and the loss of certain contractual rights. The Bank has established a comprehensive compliance system to ensure consumer protection.
Community Reinvestment. The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“CRA”) requires that, in connection with examinations of financial institutions within their jurisdiction, federal bank regulators evaluate the record of financial institutions in meeting the credit needs of its local communities, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of those institutions. A bank’s community reinvestment record is also considered by the applicable banking agencies in evaluating mergers, acquisitions, and applications to open a branch or facility. In some cases, a bank's failure to comply with the CRA or CRA protests filed by interested parties during applicable comment periods can result in the denial or delay of such transactions. The Bank received a “satisfactory” rating in its most recent CRA examination.
Insider Credit Transactions. Banks are subject to certain restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, principal shareholders, and their related interests. Extensions of credit 1) must be made on substantially the same terms (including interest rates and collateral) and follow credit underwriting procedures that are at least as stringent as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not related to the lending bank; and 2) must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. Banks are also subject to certain lending limits and restrictions on overdrafts to insiders. A violation of these restrictions may result in the assessment of substantial civil monetary penalties, regulatory enforcement actions, and other regulatory sanctions. The Dodd-Frank Act and federal regulations place additional restrictions on loans to insiders and generally prohibit loans to senior officers other than for certain specified purposes.
Regulation of Management. Federal law 1) sets forth circumstances under which officers or directors of a bank may be removed by the bank's federal supervisory agency; 2) as discussed above, places restraints on lending by a bank to its executive officers, directors, principal shareholders, and their related interests; and 3) generally prohibits management personnel of a bank from serving as directors or in other management positions of another financial institution whose assets exceed a specified amount or which has an office within a specified geographic area.
Safety and Soundness Standards. Certain non-capital safety and soundness standards are also imposed upon banks. These standards cover, among other things, internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, such other operational and managerial standards as the agency determines to be appropriate, and standards for asset quality, earnings, and stock valuation. In addition, each insured depository institution must implement a comprehensive written information security program that includes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards appropriate to the institution’s size and complexity and the nature and scope of its activities. The information security program must be designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information, and ensure the proper disposal of customer and consumer information. An institution that fails to meet these standards may be required to submit a compliance plan, or be subject to regulatory sanctions, including restrictions on growth. The Bank has established comprehensive policies and risk management procedures to ensure the safety and soundness of the Bank.
Interstate Banking and Branching
The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated interstate branching restrictions that were implemented as part of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 ("Interstate Act"), and removed many restrictions on de novo interstate branching by state and federally chartered banks.  Federal regulators have authority to approve applications by such banks to establish de novo branches in states other than the bank's home state if the host state's banks could establish a branch at the same location. The Interstate Act requires regulators to consult with community organizations before permitting an interstate institution to close a branch in a low-income area. Federal bank regulations prohibit banks from using their interstate branches primarily for deposit production and federal bank regulatory agencies have implemented a loan-to-deposit ratio screen to ensure compliance with this prohibition.
8

Dividends
A principal source of the Company’s cash is from dividends received from the Bank, which are subject to regulation and limitation. As a general rule, regulatory authorities may prohibit banks and bank holding companies from paying dividends in a manner that would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. For example, regulators have stated that paying dividends that deplete an institution's capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice and that an institution should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. In addition, a bank may not pay cash dividends if that payment could reduce the amount of its capital below that necessary to meet minimum applicable regulatory capital requirements. Current guidance from the Federal Reserve provides, among other things, that dividends per share on the Company’s common stock generally should not exceed earnings per share, measured over the previous four fiscal quarters. Under Montana law, the Bank may not declare a dividend greater than the previous two years' net earnings without providing notice to the Montana Department of Administration's Banking and Financial Institutions Division. 
Rules adopted in accordance with the third installment of the Basel Accords (“Basel III”) also impose limitations on the Bank's ability to pay dividends. In general, these rules limit the Bank's ability to pay dividends unless the Bank's common equity conservation buffer exceeds the minimum required capital ratio by at least 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets. 
The Federal Reserve has also issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies. In general, the policy statement expresses the view that although no specific regulations restrict dividend payments by bank holding companies other than state corporate laws, a bank holding company should not pay cash dividends unless the bank holding company’s earnings for the past year are sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a prospective rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the bank holding company’s capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. A bank holding company's ability to pay dividends may also be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes under-capitalized. These various regulatory policies may affect the Company's and the Bank's ability to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions. 
The Dodd-Frank Act
General. The Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law in July 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and is affecting the lending, deposit, investment, trading, and operating activities of banks and bank holding companies, including the Bank and the Company. Some of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that may impact the Company's and the Bank's business and operations are summarized below. 
Corporate Governance. The Dodd-Frank Act requires publicly traded companies to provide their shareholders with 1) a non-binding shareholder vote on executive compensation; 2) a non-binding shareholder vote on the frequency of such vote; 3) disclosure of “golden parachute” arrangements in connection with specified change in control transactions; and 4) a non-binding shareholder vote on golden parachute arrangements in connection with these change in control transactions. In August 2015, the SEC adopted a rule mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act that requires a public company to disclose the ratio of the compensation of its Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) to the median compensation of its employees. This rule is intended to provide shareholders with information that they can use to evaluate a CEO’s compensation.
Prohibition Against Charter Conversions of Financial Institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act generally prohibits a depository institution from converting from a state to federal charter, or vice versa, while it is the subject to an enforcement action unless the depository institution seeks prior approval from its primary regulator and complies with specified procedures to ensure compliance with the enforcement action.
Repeal of Demand Deposit Interest Prohibition. The Dodd-Frank Act repeals the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts.
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  The Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) and empowered it to exercise broad rulemaking, supervision, and enforcement authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws. Because the Company's total consolidated assets exceed $10 billion, it is subject to the direct supervision of the CFPB. The CFPB has issued and continues to issue numerous regulations under which the Company and the Bank will continue to incur additional expense in connection with its ongoing compliance obligations. Significant recent CFPB developments that may affect operations and compliance costs include:

• | positions taken by the CFPB on fair lending, including applying the disparate impact theory which could make it more difficult for lenders to charge different rates or to apply different terms to loans to different customers;


• | the CFPB's final rule amending Regulation C, which implements the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring most lenders to report expanded information in order for the CFPB to more effectively monitor fair lending concerns and other information shortcomings identified by the CFPB;


• | positions taken by the CFPB regarding the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E, which require companies to obtain consumer authorizations before automatically debiting a consumer’s account for pre-authorized electronic funds transfers; and


• | focused efforts on enforcing certain compliance obligations the CFPB deems a priority, such as automobile loan servicing, debt collection, mortgage origination and servicing, remittances, and fair lending, among others.

Stress Testing
In May 2018, President Trump signed into law the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (“Crapo Bill”), which is bipartisan legislation that rolls back certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act to provide regulatory relief to certain financial institutions. In relevant part, the Crapo Bill increased the asset threshold at which banks are subject to annual company-run stress tests from $10 billion to $250 billion. As a result, the Company is not currently subject to the Dodd-Frank Act stress testing requirements.
Interchange Fees
Under the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve adopted rules establishing standards for assessing whether the interchange fees that may be charged with respect to certain electronic transactions are "reasonable and proportional" to the costs incurred by issuers for processing such transactions. Notably, the Federal Reserve's rules set a maximum permissible interchange fee, among other requirements. Because the Company's total consolidated assets exceed $10 billion, it is subject to this interchange fee cap. Effective July of 2019, the interchange fee cap is expected to have a $17 to $20 million (pre-tax) annual impact to the Company's earnings.
Capital Adequacy
Banks and bank holding companies are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by state and federal regulatory agencies, which involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items calculated under regulatory guidelines. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weighting, and other factors. The capital requirements are intended to ensure that institutions have adequate capital given the risk levels of assets and off-balance sheet financial instruments and are applied separately to the Company and the Bank. 
Federal regulations require insured depository institutions and bank holding companies to meet several minimum capital standards, including: 1) a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5 percent; 2) a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6 percent; 3) a total capital to risk-based assets ratio of 8 percent; and 4) a 4 percent Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. These minimum capital requirements became effective in January 2015 and were the result of final rules implementing certain regulatory amendments based on the recommendation of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act ("Final Rules"). 
The Final Rules also require a new capital conservation buffer designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Failure to comply with this buffer requirement may result in constraints on capital distributions (e.g., dividends, equity repurchases, and certain bonus compensation for executive officers). The Final Rules change the risk-weights of certain assets for purposes of the risk-based capital ratios and phase out certain instruments as qualifying capital. 
The Final Rules also contain revisions to the prompt corrective action framework, which is designed to place restrictions on an insured depository institution if its capital levels begin to show signs of weakness. Under the prompt corrective action requirements, which are designed to complement the capital conservation buffer, insured depository institutions will be required to meet the following increased capital level requirements to qualify as “well capitalized”: 1) a Tier 1 common equity capital ratio of at least 6.5 percent; 2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8 percent; 3) a total capital ratio of at least 10 percent; 4) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 percent; and 5) not be subject to any order or written directive requiring a specific capital level. The FDIC’s rules (as amended by the Final Rules) contain other capital classification categories, such as “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” and “critically undercapitalized,” each of which are based on certain capital ratios. An institution may be downgraded to a category lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition, or if the institution receives an unsatisfactory examination rating.
The application of the Final Rules may result in lower returns on invested capital, require the raising of additional capital or require regulatory action if the Bank were unable to comply with such requirements. In addition, management may be required to modify its business strategy due to the changes to the asset risk-weights for risk-based capital calculations and the requirement to meet the capital conservation buffers. The imposition of liquidity requirements in connection with these rules could also cause the Bank to increase its holdings of liquid assets, change its business strategy, and make other changes to the terms of its funding. 
Regulatory Oversight and Examination
Inspections. The Federal Reserve conducts periodic inspections of bank holding companies, such as the Company. In general, the objectives of the Federal Reserve's inspection program are to ascertain whether the financial strength of a bank holding company is maintained on an ongoing basis and to determine the effects or consequences of transactions between a bank holding company or its non-banking subsidiaries and its bank subsidiaries. The inspection type and frequency typically varies depending on asset size, complexity of the organization, and the bank holding company’s rating at its last inspection.
10

Examinations. Banks are subject to periodic examinations by their primary regulators. In assessing a bank's condition, bank examinations have evolved from reliance on transaction testing to a risk-focused approach. These examinations are extensive and cover the entire breadth of the operations of a bank. Generally, safety and soundness examinations occur on an 18-month cycle for banks under $3 billion in total assets that are well capitalized and without regulatory issues, and 12-months otherwise. Examinations alternate between the federal and state bank regulatory agencies, and in some cases they may occur on a combined schedule. The frequency of consumer compliance and CRA examinations is linked to the size of the institution and its compliance and CRA ratings at its most recent examinations. However, the examination authority of the Federal Reserve and the FDIC allows them to examine supervised institutions as frequently as deemed necessary based on the condition of the institution or as a result of certain triggering events. Because the Company's total consolidated assets exceed $10 billion, it is also subject to the direct supervision of the CFPB.
Commercial Real Estate Ratios. The federal banking regulators recently issued guidance reminding financial institutions to reexamine the existing regulations regarding concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The purpose of the guidance is to guide banks in developing risk management practices and capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of real estate concentrations. The banking regulators are directed to examine each bank’s exposure to commercial real estate loans that are dependent on cash flow from the real estate held as collateral and to focus their supervisory resources on institutions that may have significant commercial real estate loan concentration risk. The guidance provides that the strength of an institution’s lending and risk management practices with respect to such concentrations will be taken into account in evaluating capital adequacy and does not specifically limit a bank’s commercial real estate lending to a specified concentration level.
Corporate Governance and Accounting
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“SOX Act”) addresses, among other things, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information, and penalties for non-compliance. In general, the SOX Act 1) requires chief executive officers and chief financial officers to certify to the compliance of periodic reports filed with the SEC; 2) imposes specific and enhanced corporate disclosure requirements; 3) accelerates the time frame for reporting insider transactions and periodic disclosures by public companies; 4) requires companies to adopt and disclose information about corporate governance practices, including whether or not they have adopted a code of ethics for senior financial officers and whether the audit committee includes at least one “audit committee financial expert”; and 5) requires the SEC, based on certain enumerated factors, to regularly and systematically review corporate filings. As a publicly reporting company, the Company is subject to the requirements of the SOX Act and related rules and regulations issued by the SEC and NASDAQ. 
Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism
The Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) requires all financial institutions to establish a risk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The BSA also sets forth various recordkeeping and reporting requirements (such as reporting suspicious activities that might signal criminal activity) and certain due diligence and "know your customer" documentation requirements.
The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (“Patriot Act”), intended to combat terrorism, was renewed with certain amendments in 2006. In relevant part, the Patriot Act 1) prohibits banks from providing correspondent accounts directly to foreign shell banks; 2) imposes due diligence requirements on banks opening or holding accounts for foreign financial institutions or wealthy foreign individuals; 3) requires financial institutions to establish an anti-money laundering compliance program; and 4) eliminates civil liability for persons who file suspicious activity reports. The Patriot Act also includes provisions providing the government with power to investigate terrorism, including expanded government access to bank account records. Regulators are directed to consider a bank holding company’s and a bank’s effectiveness in combating money laundering when reviewing and ruling on applications under the BHCA and the Bank Merger Act. The Company and the Bank have established comprehensive compliance programs designed to comply with the requirements of the BSA and Patriot Act.
Financial Services Modernization
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 (“GLBA”) brought about significant changes to the laws affecting banks and bank holding companies. Generally, the GLBA 1) repeals historical restrictions on preventing banks from affiliating with securities firms; 2) provides a uniform framework for the activities of banks, savings institutions, and their holding companies; 3) broadens the activities that may be conducted by national banks and banking subsidiaries of bank holding companies; 4) provides an enhanced framework for protecting the privacy of consumer information and requires notification to consumers of bank privacy policies; and 5) addresses a variety of other legal and regulatory issues affecting both day-to-day operations and long-term activities of financial institutions. The Bank is subject to FDIC regulations implementing the privacy provisions of the GLBA. These regulations require a bank to disclose its privacy policy, including informing consumers of the bank's information sharing practices and their right to opt out of certain practices.

Deposit Insurance
FDIC Insured Deposits. The Bank's deposits are insured under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, up to the maximum applicable limits and are subject to deposit insurance assessments by the FDIC, which are designed to tie what banks pay for deposit insurance to the risks they pose. The Dodd-Frank Act redefined the assessment base used for calculating deposit insurance assessments by requiring the FDIC to determine assessments based on assets instead of deposits. Assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity capital of a financial institution. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act 1) raised the minimum designated reserve ratio (the FDIC is required to set the reserve ratio each year) of the DIF from 1.15 percent to 1.35 percent; 2) required that the DIF reserve ratio meet 1.35 percent by 2020; and 3) eliminated the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to insured depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds. The Dodd-Frank Act made banks with $10 billion or more in total assets, such as the Bank, responsible for the increase from 1.15 percent to 1.35 percent. On September 30, 2018, the DIF reserve ratio reached 1.36 percent, ahead of the Dodd-Frank Act’s 2020 deadline to meet the 1.35 percent reserve ratio. As a result, certain institutions, such as the Bank, will receive credits for the portions of their regular assessments that contributed to growth in the reserve ratio between 1.15 percent and 1.35 percent, to be applied when the reserve ratio is at or above 1.38 percent. No institution may pay a dividend if it is in default on its federal deposit insurance assessment. The FDIC may also prohibit any insured institution from engaging in any activity determined by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the DIF.
Safety and Soundness. The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution if the FDIC determines after a hearing that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order, or any condition imposed by an agreement with the FDIC. Management is not aware of any existing circumstances that would result in termination of the Bank's deposit insurance.
Insurance of Deposit Accounts. The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased FDIC deposit insurance from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor. The FDIC insurance coverage limit applies per depositor, per insured depository institution for each account ownership category.
Recent and Proposed Legislation
The economic and political environment of the past several years has led to a number of proposed legislative, governmental, and regulatory initiatives that may significantly impact the banking industry. Other regulatory initiatives by federal and state agencies may also significantly impact the Company's and the Bank’s business. The Company and the Bank cannot predict whether these or any other proposals will be enacted or the ultimate impact of any such initiatives on its operations, competitive situation, financial conditions, or results of operations. While recent history has demonstrated that new legislation or changes to existing laws or regulations typically result in a greater compliance burden (and therefore increase the general costs of doing business), the current administration has expressed an attempt to reduce these regulatory burdens.
Effects of Federal Government Monetary Policy
The Company’s earnings and growth are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government, particularly the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve implements national monetary policy to promote maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. Through its open market operations in U.S. government securities, control of the discount rate applicable to borrowings, establishment of reserve requirements against certain deposits, and control of the interest rate applicable to excess reserve balances and reverse repurchase agreements, the Federal Reserve influences the availability and cost of money and credit and, ultimately, a range of economic variables including employment, output, and the prices of goods and services. The nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies and their impact on the Company and the Bank cannot be predicted with certainty.
Heightened Requirements for Large Bank Holding Companies and Banks
As mentioned above, the Dodd-Frank Act imposed heightened requirements on large bank holding companies and banks, and the Crapo Bill has rolled back certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. In particular, the Crapo Bill increased the asset threshold for certain rules that previously applied to bank holding companies and banks with at least $10 billion in total consolidated assets. As a result of the Crapo Bill, the Company is not currently subject to several of those heightened requirements (e.g., stress testing and a dedicated risk committee), but the Company will remain subject to other requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act left unaffected by the Crapo Bill, such as the requirement that the Company be examined, primarily by the CFPB, for compliance with federal consumer protection laws. 
The Company has established a comprehensive compliance system to ensure compliance with these rules.
