Other Company Information
Materials
All of our businesses require various products, manufactured components, and raw materials; the availability and prices of which may fluctuate. 
MANUFACTURED COMPONENTS ASSEMBLED INTO OUR PRODUCTS
• Motors | • Castings 
• Mechanical Seals | • Machined Castings 
• Metal Fabrications | • Miscellaneous Metal, Plastic, and Electronic Components


PRIMARY RAW MATERIALS 
• Steel | • Gold | • Copper | • Nickel
• Iron | • Aluminum | • Tin | • Rubber
• Specialty Alloys, including Titanium | | 

Raw materials are purchased in various forms, such as sheet, bar, rod and wire stock, pellets, and metal powders. Raw materials, supplies and product subassemblies are purchased from third-party suppliers, contract manufacturers, and commodity dealers. For most of our products, we have existing alternate sources of supply, or such materials are readily available. In some instances we depend on a single source of supply, manufacturing or assembly, or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to a limited number of suppliers.
We continually monitor the business conditions of our supply chain to maintain our market position and to avoid potential supply disruptions. There have been no raw material shortages that have had a material adverse impact on our business as a whole, and we have been able to develop a robust supply chain such that we do not anticipate shortages of such materials in the future.
Although some cost increases may be recovered through increased prices to customers, our operating results are generally exposed to fluctuations in the prices of raw materials and commodities due to inflation, and most recently, tariffs imposed by the U.S, or other countries. When practical, we attempt to control such costs through fixed-priced contracts with suppliers. We typically acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our materials requirements for an average of four to eight weeks, with the exception of some specialty materials. From time to time, we experience price volatility or supply constraints for raw materials based on market supply and demand dynamics. In limited circumstances, we may have to obtain scarce components for higher prices on the spot market, which may have a negative impact on gross margin and can periodically create a disruption to production and delivery. We also acquire certain inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longer-term pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority, price, and availability of supply. We evaluate hedging opportunities to mitigate or minimize the risk of operating margin erosion resulting from the volatility of commodity prices.
Manufacturing Methods
We utilize two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products, build-to-order and engineer-to-order. 

• | Build-to-order consists of assembling a group of products with the same pre-defined specifications, generally for our OEM customers. We employ build-to-order capabilities to maximize manufacturing and logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations.


• | Engineer-to-order consists of assembling a customized system according to a customer’s individual order specifications. Engineering products-to-order permits the configuration of units to meet the customized requirements of our customers.

In both cases, we offer design, integration, test and other production value-added services. Our inventory management and distribution practices in both build-to-order and engineer-to-order seek to improve customer delivery performance and minimize inventory holding periods.
Backlog
Our backlog represents firm orders that have been received, acknowledged and entered into our production systems. Our backlog may vary due to market volatility or other changes in macroeconomic conditions. In addition, delivery schedules vary from customer to customer based on their requirements. For example, large complex projects in specialized markets such as oil and gas, chemical, and mining at IP require longer lead times and production cycles. Delivery delays could arise from supply chain limitations, internal production challenges, changes in the customer’s requirements, or technical difficulties. We expect to satisfy nearly all backlog commitments within 12 months. The following table illustrates our total backlog by segment as of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively: 

 | 2018 | | 2017 | | | 2016 
Motion Technologies | $ | 303.1 | | $ | 299.7 | | $ | 201.2
Industrial Process(a) | 444.2 | | 385.5 | | | 347.2
Connect & Control Technologies | 273.7 | | 233.5 | | | 236.7
ITT Inc. | $ | 1,021.0 | | $ | 918.7 | | $ | 785.1


(a) | The Industrial Process backlog amount as of December 31, 2017 presented in the table above has been updated from the amount previously reported in the 2017 Form 10-K to include an additional $49 of backlog related to impacts associated with the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard, Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2014-09.

Intellectual Property
We generally seek patent protection for certain inventions and improvements that are likely to be incorporated into our products or where proprietary rights are expected to improve our competitive position. The highly customized application engineering embedded within our products, our proprietary rights, our knowledge capabilities, and our brand recognition all contribute to enhancing our competitive position.
While we own and control a significant number of patents, trade secrets, confidential information, trademarks, trade names, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights which, in the aggregate, are of material importance to our business, management believes that our Company, as a whole, as well as each of our core segments, is not materially dependent on any one intellectual property right or related group of such rights. Patents, patent applications, and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law, in accordance with their terms or otherwise. As the portfolio of our patents, patent applications, and license agreements has evolved over a long period of time, we do not expect the expiration of any specific patent or other intellectual property right to have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.
Research and Development
Research and Development (R&D) is key to our strategy and is generally focused on the design of highly engineered solutions that enable our customers to achieve their results. Our approach to R&D often begins by working closely with our customers to address their needs by engineering a solution to fit the particular application. R&D focuses on developing tangible solutions that bring a competitive offering that address clear needs in the market segments we serve. As a result, we believe R&D is a source of competitive advantage. With this in mind, we focused our effort to support business growth by increasing R&D activities in 2018 and plan to continue this focus into 2019 as part of our long-term growth strategy. Toward this effort, in recent years, we have invested in new innovation centers of excellence in Italy and China and plan to continue this effort in the U.S. in the future.
Cyclicality and Seasonality
Many of the businesses in which we operate are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles. We consider our connector products in our CCT segment to be an early cycle business, meaning it generally is impacted more in the early portion of an economic cycle, while the automotive and aerospace components businesses tend to be impacted in the middle portion of the cycle and the industrial pump business typically is impacted late in the economic cycle.
Our businesses experience limited seasonal variations. Revenue impacts from the limited seasonal variations are typically mitigated by our backlog of orders that allow us to adjust levels of production across different periods.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to stringent federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations concerning air emissions, water discharges and waste disposal. In the U.S., these include, but are not limited to, the Federal Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource, Conservation and Recovery Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. Environmental requirements are significant factors affecting our operations. We have established an internal program to assess compliance with applicable environmental requirements at our facilities. The program, which includes periodic audits of many of our locations, including our major operating facilities, is designed to identify problems in a timely manner, correct deficiencies and prevent future noncompliance.
We closely monitor our environmental responsibilities, together with trends in environmental laws. In addition, we have purchased insurance protection against certain environmental risks arising from our business activities. Environmental laws and regulations are subject to change, however, and the nature and timing of such changes, if any, is difficult to predict. As actual costs incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from our current estimates given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures, management believes it is possible that the outcome of these uncertainties may have a material adverse effect on our financial statements. See "Critical Accounting Estimates" within Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis, as well as Note 20, Commitments and Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 10,000 employees, of which approximately 3,100 were located in the U.S. Approximately 20% of our U.S. employees are represented by unions. No one unionized facility accounts for more than 12% of ITT's total revenues. In addition, many of our global employees are covered by collective agreements or represented by works councils or other groups. Although our relations with our employees are strong and we have not experienced any material strikes or work stoppages recently, we can provide no assurance that we will not experience these or other types of conflict with groups representing our employees or our employees generally, or that any future negotiations with our labor unions will not result in significant increases in our cost of labor. 
Change in Leadership
On December 31, 2018, Denise L. Ramos retired from the role of Chief Executive Officer and Director of the Company. On January 1, 2019, Luca Savi, formerly President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company, became the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer. In addition, the Board elected Mr. Savi to serve as a director of the Company, effective January 1, 2019.
