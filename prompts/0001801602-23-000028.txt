Item 1. Business
Our Mission
We provide our clients with an easy-to-use loyalty, digital communications platform that drives their consumers to action. SpringBig empowers our clients to effectively communicate with, increase the loyalty of, and expand their consumer population through the provision of an integrated technology platform supported by robust analytics. Our goal is to become the leading SaaS software platform to cannabis retailers and brands, providing data-driven loyalty, marketing and consumer buying experience solutions throughout the U.S. and Canada, and ultimately expanding internationally and into other regulated markets.
Summary of Our Business
SpringBig is a market-leading software platform providing customer loyalty and marketing automation solutions to retailers and brands. SpringBig believes that it is a market leader in its product categories for a number of factors including, among others, (i) the number of SpringBig customers and consumers enrolled on SpringBig’s platform (and the percentage of known licensed cannabis retailers enrolled in SpringBig’s product service); (ii) scale (SpringBig has operations and clients in all states that have legalized cannabis); (iii) the comprehensive services offered by SpringBig; (iv) the technology offered by SpringBig that, among other things, connects the three categories of participants in the cannabis ecosystem (customers, retailers, and brands) and provides effective communications and marketing to end-consumers; (v) SpringBig’s expertise in loyalty programs and marketing automation; (vi) the quality of SpringBig’s client services; and (vii) SpringBig’s ability to provide data analytics.
Since our inception in 2016, we have leveraged our deep expertise in loyalty marketing to develop solutions that address the key challenges faced by retailers and brands, including those in the cannabis industry. Stringent, complex, and rapidly evolving regulations have resulted in restricted access to traditional marketing channels for cannabis retailers and brands, preventing them from utilizing many traditional methods for effectively accessing and engaging with consumers. In addition, the lack of industry-specific data and market intelligence solutions limit cannabis retailers’ and brands’ ability to efficiently market their products, thereby hindering their growth. Our platform enables our clients to increase brand awareness, engage customers, improve retention, and access actionable consumer feedback data to improve marketing. Our clients can use our loyalty marketing, digital communications, and text/email marketing solutions drive new customer acquisition, customer spend and retail foot traffic. Our proven business-to-business-to-customer (“B2B2C”) software platform creates powerful network effects between retailers and brands and provides an ability for both to connect directly with consumers. As retailers and brand scale, a virtuous cycle is created, ultimately expanding SpringBig’s reach, strengthening our value proposition:
Today, we serve approximately 1,300 brand and retailer clients across approximately 3,000 distinct retail locations in North America. Our clients distribute in excess of 2 billion messages annually, and in the last year more than $7.5 billion of gross merchandise value (“GMV”) was accounted for by our clients utilizing our platform. SpringBig has successfully grown its revenue at a rapid pace, from $5.7 million in 2019 to $26.6 million in 2022. We have an excellent track record of securing and retaining our clients with our value proposition, which we measure by our “net revenue retention rate.” When evaluating our retention rates and calculating our net revenue retention rate, SpringBig calculates the average recurring monthly revenue from retail clients, adjusted for losses, increases and decreases in monthly subscriptions during the prior twelve months divided by the average recurring monthly subscription revenue over the same trailing twelve-month period. To determine the average recurring monthly revenue, SpringBig calculates monthly subscription revenue (derived from the monthly recurring subscription fees paid by retail clients, excluding the initial monthly contract amount of any new client subscriptions) from all retail clients, averaged over the previous twelve month period. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Key Operating and Financial Metrics” for a further discussion of net revenue retention rate.
We believe SpringBig is well positioned to become the leading software platform for cannabis retailers and brands by providing data-driven loyalty and marketing solutions to enhance a frictionless consumer buying experience.
What SpringBig Does
We have developed and commercialized a comprehensive suite of Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) solutions for our retailer and brand clients (who we refer to as “clients” and their end-user customers as “customers” or “consumers”).
Through their subscriptions, our retail clients have access to in-depth campaign data, robust analytics, and actionable feedback and summaries to help inform their business decisions and maximize customer engagement and retention. When a client subscribes to our platform, we charge affordable initial set-up fees and the majority of our revenue is derived from a monthly recurring subscription fee. Typically, our subscription agreements extend for twelve months, and unless terminated in accordance with their terms, generally renew for subsequent and recurring 12-month periods. Our client subscriptions cover access to our platform as well as messaging services.
Within the terms of a subscription, a client receives a pre-determined quantum of communication credits per month, and we invoice the client additional amounts if the pre-determined credit volume is exceeded in any month (though the subscription agreements do not stipulate the volume of messages the client must cause to be sent during a month). The fees for such excess use are set forth in the client’s subscription agreement. In some cases, a client has separate subscriptions relating to the use of the software platform and the communications and, in other cases, these are bundled into a single subscription.
The monthly subscription fee charged to SpringBig’s clients is set forth in such client’s subscription agreement and is based on the scope of the subscription, which is determined based on (1) the number of customers on a client’s database (e.g., use of the SpringBig platform) and/or (2) the pre-determined quantum of communication credits that such client may use per month. As noted above, if this pre-determined credit volume is exceeded in any month, SpringBig will invoice the client for such excess use by the client. Excess use revenue has historically accounted for up to 30% of revenue. We expect excess use revenue as a percentage of recurring subscription revenue to decrease as customers scale and progress to higher subscription tiers over their lifetime. SpringBig’s revenue is not based on the success or effectiveness of any marketing campaign communications.
We also generate revenue by empowering brands with direct access to consumers via our brands platform. Our recently introduced brands platform allows brands to advertise and engage cannabis consumers, drive brand awareness, acquire VIP customers with high lifetime value, and access detailed reporting insights into essential campaign attribution metrics. Pricing for the brands platform is either structured on a bulk-pay basis or as a monthly subscription.
Industry Overview
We operate within the large and expanding cannabis retail market in the United States and Canada. Cannabis is one of the fastest emerging consumer end markets in the U.S, and it is expected to grow from $20 billion in 2020 to in excess of $40 billion by 2025, representing a compound annual growth in excess of 15%. Currently, 37 states plus the District of Columbia have legalized medical cannabis, and 21 states plus the District of Columbia have legalized adult-use cannabis. While there is generally a lag period between the time a market adopts legislation permitting either medical or adult cannabis use and significant revenue generation by SpringBig, states that have recently enacted legalization measures, such as New York and New Jersey, are expected to contribute significant additional sales growth to the market by 2025 when they are expected to be fully operational. Further momentum from the legislative and regulatory changes is expected to drive expansion of the total addressable market as more states continue to legalize cannabis for adult-use and medical use. We operate in all states that have legalized cannabis in some form (be it adult-use or medical), and we plan to be a first-mover in future new markets. Additional tailwinds such as a decrease in raw material costs, intensifying competition amongst cannabis retailers and brands, and 
increased marketing spends by clients are also expected to contribute to the expansion of our total addressable market as customer engagement and retention will become ever more critical for cannabis retailers and brands to succeed.
Current technology offerings to cannabis retailers and brands are rudimentary, and the technology landscape offers a highly fragmented environment with lots of competition within a pool of small players. We believe that SpringBig is the leading loyalty and marketing software platform of scale to the cannabis industry and that we are best positioned to capture the significant uptick expected in marketing spend. There are only a few cannabis-specific companies that provide products similar to our offering, and SpringBig currently does not face competition from traditional loyalty marketing providers due to legal restrictions for cannabis at the federal level; however, as described in “Key Challenges,” below, SpringBig believes it is well-positioned to provide differentiated value as the competitive landscape evolves.
Key Challenges
The stringent and evolving regulations, which also vary state-by-state, restrict retailers’ and brands’ abilities to engage with customers, currently present significant challenges to their marketing efforts. In addition, these retailers and brands lack access to actionable data and analytics tools to market their products to customers efficiently.
Customer Engagement Needs
The cannabis industry is a highly fragmented and competitive industry where price and promotions are key drivers of sales. Further, traditional marketing channels restrict cannabis marketing, preventing businesses from marketing their products and reaching consumers. Google, Facebook, and other social media platforms serve as an outlet for businesses to market their products in most other industries, but they restrict cannabis companies from operating on their platforms. Some SMS providers also restrict licensed cannabis businesses from accessing networks, and these barriers currently make it challenging for cannabis retailers and brands to drive customer acquisition, retention, engagement, and loyalty. Furthermore, the continued penetration by cannabis focused e-commerce providers have increased competition and decreased customer loyalty for bricks and mortar cannabis retailers.
SpringBig has developed and commercialized a comprehensive suite of SaaS solutions to address the challenges that cannabis retailers and brands face in this industry. Further, while cannabis clients do not currently have access to certain traditional marketing channels, including social media platforms, we believe that our platform’s products and services, in particular our data and analytics capabilities, position us well to provide significant value to cannabis retailers and brands whenever these social media platforms become available, by enabling these businesses to determine the effective targeting and focus of their marketing solutions and loyalty programs.
As state-by-state legalization continues, we expect cannabis retailers and brands to look to expand and seek new ways to reach and engage customers efficiently.
Data and Analytics Needs
In our experience, many cannabis retailers and brands lack access to customer feedback data that is essential to reach customers and build relationships with them efficiently. Additionally, we have found that cannabis retailers and brands do not currently have the technological infrastructure and analytical tools necessary to process the data they collect from customers into actionable data for marketing purposes. Unlike most other industries, the cannabis sector requires market intelligence and data solutions that are tailored to the specific needs of individual retailers, brands and consumers considering the current restrictive and evolving regulatory and legal environment. The current federal regulatory status of cannabis poses barriers of entry for large communication and data solution providers, representing a significant unmet need.
How SpringBig Addresses These Challenges
Our solutions are designed to address the key challenges faced by cannabis retailers and brands. Today’s industry participants lack sufficient visibility into customer behavior and need a solution that bridges communication between consumers, retailers and brands. We believe our solutions foster valuable connections and interactions that improve clarity, trust and satisfaction between these stakeholders.
Although carrier-imposed restrictions limit the use of blatant cannabis content being sent directly via SMS, SpringBig has developed a proprietary solution, compliant with TCPA, FCC, and Canadian CRTC, that helps cannabis retailers and brands communicate directly with their consumers, offering a direct communication and engagement channel, using text, images and other forms of media.
We believe our platform empowers our clients to improve and analyze customer acquisition, retention, basket spend and retail foot traffic. Retailers and brands can use SpringBig’s platform to connect with consumers, thus driving improvements in customer engagement and retention and increasing brand exposure. Once customers are engaged, the SpringBig platform enables businesses to amplify consumer spend through differentiated marketing solutions which target the consumer directly in an industry where doing so has been challenging in the past. While brand loyalty in the cannabis market has historically proven challenging, our offerings effectively connect the consumer with brands and drive loyalty.
We provide retailers with the analytics infrastructure to make data actionable. Our data solutions are purpose-built for the cannabis industry and enable our clients to leverage data to more effectively market their products to consumers. Through our integrations with 19 point of sale (“POS”) providers, 4 major cannabis e-commerce providers and other data providers, our platform offers robust consumer purchasing and marketing feedback data to allow our customers to take direct marketing and promotional actions. These commercial relationships take varying forms, depending on the relationship, including licensing and referral arrangements.
Furthermore, our proprietary auto-connect module supports further automation of marketing campaigns based on data. We also offer marketing automation solutions that provide for consistency of customer communication, which retailers and brands can use to drive customer retention and retail foot traffic. Our platform offers functionality to help build brand loyalty through loyalty programs that offer various rewards and offers. Our reporting and analytics offerings deliver valuable insights that our clients utilize to better understand their customer base, purchasing habits and trends. Consumer actions become measurable, thus providing our clients with data that can be leveraged to make better informed business decisions and more targeted marketing campaigns.
In the cannabis industry, the retailer maintains the relationship with the consumer, and it is challenging in the current regulatory environment for brands to directly interact with those consumers. The SpringBig brands platform enables brands to directly interact with consumers in a manner that is otherwise not feasible, short of such brand independently compiling and maintaining a separate consumer database.
Through SMS marketing, emails, customer feedback system and loyalty programs, we believe our solutions are crucial in managing customer relationships in this emerging industry. In time, as legislation permits, our product offerings will likely be enhanced to incorporate other aspects of the customer experience, including further enhanced data analytics and, when legally permissible, online ordering and payments.
Our Retail Offering
We serve in excess of 1,300 retailers in approximately 3,000 distinct locations providing them with a comprehensive suite of tools needed to attract customers, market products, and analyze key data. We are entrenched with most of the leading multi-state operators which allows us to capture the “enterprise” customer base, while also being equally suited to the smaller cannabis retail operators.
The anticipated growth of the cannabis retail market presents an opportunity to reach additional retailers as cannabis becomes more widely used and states continue to legalize. The tools that we provide allow retailers to engage and better communicate with their consumers. Further, SpringBig offers retailers robust reporting and analytics tools, which help them understand product and sales trends, track consumer activity, and gain insights that can be leveraged to drive sales.
On the consumer side, we offer a suite of elegant consumer-facing products. The enrollment process is streamlined and designed to provide for compliance and clarity. Once enrolled, consumers can develop their profile, will receive appropriate messages and offers and access their retailer’s specific rewards wallet application, where multiple images, videos, and links can be added for the consumer to explore.
An important component of our platform is text message marketing, which allows clients to send promotions to existing customers. Our text messaging platform offers a variety of features, including multiple customer segmentations, which automatically groups customers into segments based on their preferences and purchase behavior. Retailers also have access to the “autoconnects” feature, which allows them to easily leverage customer data and send messages directly to consumers based on certain actions and also includes functionality to help clients avoid missed opportunities to send text messages. We also provide an e-signature app, designed to accommodate a proper ‘double opt-in’ procedure, through both implied and expressed consent, to facilitate compliance with the TCPA, FCC, and Canadian CRTC. Finally, campaign performance analytics provide transparency on deliverability and message opening rates. We utilize proprietary technology to filter out fake phone numbers, burner phones, and landlines. In an environment where communication with cannabis consumers is constrained, text messaging is extremely effective in influencing purchase behavior, while also driving foot traffic and continuing to reach new customers and target markets.
Retailers compile highly-targeted marketing campaigns based on the consumer profiles and preferences and are provided with detailed campaign metrics that enable further refinement and enhanced targeting of future campaigns. The consumer application (wallet) itself can easily be customized with a distinct icon, name, layout, and color scheme, thus allowing for brand consistency and a higher-quality and frictionless customer experience. Here, customers can access and check their points, redeem rewards, and view upcoming offers. The wallet fully integrates with cannabis e-commerce providers, allowing customers to place orders directly from their wallet. The features and ease of use that comes with the SpringBig rewards wallet creates customer loyalty and establishes a relationship between the client and the consumer. Customer relationships are a crucial component in retail that has been restricted as a result of the complexities of the cannabis industry. Nonetheless, we have designed our platform to make this connection easy.
The SpringBig platform also provides support for consumer feedback with robust dashboards that track key survey performance indicators that allow clients to measure customer satisfaction. The “Feedback by SpringBig” offering allows businesses to survey customers post-purchase, track and analyze feedback, and then take action based on this information. From the initial online search to in-store purchase, clients possess the ability to track the entire customer experience. Comprehensive reports give clients the tools to better understand customer trends, and allows the retailer to analyze specific operational, product, and promotional opportunities. By identifying key trends, our users are able to improve customer loyalty and increase retention.
SpringBig offers retailers powerful insight dashboards that provide comprehensive data that can be used to make informed business decisions. Our platform also allows retailers to create marketing campaigns, ensuring that consumers receive all relevant promotions. Once a campaign launches, retailers are able to analyze in-depth data in order to measure campaign success. ERP-level customer data management and analysis also allow retailers to organize their sales funnel and provide a personalized, targeted approach to marketing campaigns.
Our platform integrates with many of the leading POS systems in the cannabis industry, which allows retailers to simplify workstreams by automatically collecting a plethora of data on consumers. Integrating our marketing automation software with the retailer’s POS system makes for more efficient management of customer relationships and facilitates using specific POS data in design and implementation of marketing campaigns. With integrations, in real-time retailers can review performance results and the return on investment (“ROI”) for each marketing campaign. Additionally, the SpringBig clients are also able to ascertain which cannabis brands and products perform the best, thus allowing retailers to customize meaningful messaging and offers for their customer base.
Our Brand Marketing Platform
Our brand marketing platform offers a leading direct-to-consumer marketing automation platform in the cannabis industry. The data-rich direct-to-consumer marketing engine allows brands to target and measure the complete transaction cycle from initial engagement through point of sale.
We provide cannabis brands with the opportunity to provide content that, in turn, our retail clients can utilize in their targeted consumer marketing campaigns. This provides the brand with differentiated access to the consumer and that can be effectively leveraged through the brand and retailer cooperating in a promotional campaign on our platform.
Brands aim to materially increase their brand awareness, expand retail partnerships and acquire and retain new customers. The SpringBig brands platform provides brand clients with access to detailed reports that offer valuable insights into essential campaign attribution metrics. There are approximately 5,000 existing cannabis brands in the U.S., and this early-stage initiative represents a significant future growth opportunity for us. Our marketing database with over 40 million consumers is a highly-differentiated SpringBig asset that powers cannabis brands in driving brand recognition and promoting awareness.
Our Platform and Data Assets
We have created a distinct B2B2C platform supported by a wealth of data assets to effectively monetize our large and growing base of cannabis consumers. Currently, the cannabis industry falls significantly short of market intelligence and data solutions that would typically be found in other industries: retailers lack analytics infrastructure to make data actionable for marketing, and lack of feedback data poses challenges for brands to reach and establish relationships with consumers directly. Our leading messaging, loyalty, and customer experience platform recognizes powerful network effects among brands, retailers, and cannabis consumers to enable our clients to make better business decisions. We retain retailers as paying SaaS subscription customers, who then acquire consumers. Brands target retailers that successfully acquire loyal consumers, which drives increased retailer interest and recurring revenue.
The SpringBig platform is also supported by large data assets created by our fully integrated cannabis technology ecosystem. We partner with industry leading data analytics, e-commerce, and POS providers to monetize our base of over 40 million consumers and generate revenue for our clients.
We intend to continue to invest in our platform to enhance its functionality and the value of our data assets so that both we and our clients can continue to grow. We anticipate building on our existing platform infrastructure so that we are well positioned to benefit from the further emergence of the burgeoning cannabis and cannabis-tech markets.
Certain Regulatory Considerations and How We Adapt to Changing Regulatory Landscape
SpringBig helps drive regulatory compliance. We pride ourselves on being ahead of the curve when it comes to changes to regulations to both SMS and to the overall cannabis landscape.
The TCPA prohibits autodialed text messages, unless made with the prior express, written consent of the receiving party, to any telephone number assigned to a cell phone. Additionally, mobile carriers act as gatekeepers between businesses and consumers. The Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (“CTIA”), a trade organization for mobile carriers (including SpringBig’s messaging distributors), periodically issues industry best practice guidance which currently includes prohibiting messaging content that contains or promotes sex, hate, alcohol, firearms, or tobacco (referred to as “SHAFT”), and interpretation of this guidance includes cannabis within the tobacco category. SpringBig’s platform (including, in particular, its text message marketing) is designed to ensure compliance with TCPA, SHAFT guidelines, and other applicable CTIA guidance; SpringBig proactively monitors and, as necessary, adapts its platform and services to comply with these guidelines and standards. Further, as part of its proactive monitoring of mobile carriers’ guidelines, SpringBig endeavors to maintain close relationships with our messaging distributors, and as such, have been made well aware of any carrier-implemented restrictions that may impact the way cannabis retailers and brands communicate with their consumers via SMS. These relationships have allowed us to continue servicing our customers in a rapidly changing environment, with no disruption of service or restrictions from sending messages from major carriers.
SpringBig’s customers can utilize the platform consent interface or other means to obtain the consumer’s consent that is required to receive messages, and, as an integral part of its services, SpringBig creates templates for its retail customers that are in compliance with SHAFT guidelines to use in promotional messaging. The approved templates do not explicitly discuss or promote cannabis, but rather provide general information about the retailer, the consumer’s reward status and can also incorporate a link that directs opted-in consumers to additional promotional material created by the retailer customers.
As a third-party provider of a software platform, state cannabis regulatory marketing rules generally do not apply to SpringBig. SpringBig’s retail customers are responsible for ensuring that their marketing materials comply with state law.
Additionally, SpringBig has instituted policies and procedures to verify the licensing status of our clients (which are utilized in on-boarding both retail and brand clients in addition to other client diligence) and to conduct periodic screening to confirm the continued licensing status of our clients. Further, SpringBig is constantly monitoring proposed and pending legislative changes on the state and federal level. We have an emerging markets-focused sales team that is designed to ensure SpringBig is developing relationships with retailers, brands, and partners in emerging markets, so when the legalization status changes, those retailers, brands and potential partners already have a deep partnership formed with SpringBig. One of the primary ways we do this is through our “Greenhouse” program. This program allows licensed retailers who have not yet opened their doors to build their potential consumer list, design their loyalty program, and meet our extensive partnership network to 
help inform their tech stack decisions as they move towards being fully operational. We have found that this program has helped us make headway in the emerging cannabis markets and sets up the foundation for a strong partnership in the future.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe that we are a leading provider of customer loyalty and marketing automation solutions to cannabis retailers and brands, and our key competitive strengths are the following:
We are a leading direct-to-consumer marketing and customer loyalty platform in the cannabis industry. We are the largest loyalty & marketing automation provider in the cannabis space with over 40 million consumers enrolled in our platform, and over 1,300 retailer and brand customers with approximately 3,000 discrete retail locations. We started serving the cannabis market in 2016 and were a pioneer in providing SMS marketing solutions to cannabis retailers. As we expanded our customer base, platform and solutions, we now serve approximately one-third of all retail locations in the United States. We partner with the majority of the leading multi-state-operators (“MSOs”). We believe that our differentiated suite of solutions and deep understanding of customer needs will enable us to expand our leadership position as we grow into existing and new markets and expand our offering.
We have a diverse geographic footprint, with operations in all states that have legalized cannabis in some form. We believe that our broader geographic footprint, scope of operations, and established position in the industry all support our efforts to be a first mover in future new markets and also may make it more difficult, time-intensive and costly for competitors to replicate.
We provide critical value to our customers demonstrated by leading net retention. Loyalty and messaging are critical for cannabis retailers and brands to directly engage, connect, and retain their customer base. Our suite of solutions is designed to enable our customers to engage with their consumers in an efficient way, sustainably driving customer retention, acquisition, spend and foot-traffic. On average, our clients are able to recover the cost of their monthly subscription for the SpringBig platform within a couple of days of utilizing our offerings each month. In addition, we have successfully integrated with 19 of the industry’s leading POS systems, which enables us to collect and analyze consumer data and feedback, providing our clients with actionable insights for marketing purposes, and we have also completed our initial POS system integration outside of the cannabis industry. Our ability to expand our relationships with customers, and their satisfaction in our product offerings and client service, are demonstrated by our category leading net revenue retention rate being consistently above 100% and having averaged in excess of 110% over the past three years. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Key Operating and Financial Metrics” for a further discussion of net revenue retention rate.
In addition to the value provided through our platform, we believe that the quality of our client service and our responsiveness to clients provides us with a competitive advantage. Management believes that our established presence in the industry and personal one-on-one service philosophy enhances our ability to compete favorably in attracting and retaining clients.
We have a deep expertise of marketing regulation in the cannabis industry and the challenges faced by our clients. We entered the cannabis market in 2016 and have leveraged our management’s expertise in loyalty programs and marketing automation from other sectors to solve the challenges faced by cannabis retailers and brands to engage with their customers and increase retention. We have designed specific campaign and communication solutions that comply with cannabis regulation and are rapidly implementable by our clients as they expand in the high growth and highly competitive cannabis industry. We are highly differentiated from our competitors in several ways. We have integrations with 19 POS providers in the cannabis market, and these integrations allow our clients to offer their consumers a seamless experience for points redemption and loyalty program enrollment. Additionally, we have invested, and continue to invest significantly in ensuring we have a robust, scalable business, with a particular emphasis on client success and engineering. While SpringBig does not obtain customers on behalf of our clients, our client success organization services each client from contract signing throughout their life with SpringBig, providing onboarding services, and on-going education and support. This team is also responsible for guiding our clients through the ever-changing regulatory environment. Our engineering team, primarily based in the U.S., makes up the largest percentage of our staff. The team is constantly working to enhance the platform with the addition of new features and functionality at a regular cadence to ensure we remain significantly ahead of our competitors in this regard. Additionally, after completing the onboarding process, SpringBig customers are assigned a dedicated client success manager who is responsible for overall account management, including monitoring campaign deliverability and providing information on strategic campaign and auto-connect usage. Our client support team is available for all inbound requests from 8am-8pm ET and services all North American time zones.
We are the highly regarded platform of choice to consolidate the highly fragmented cannabis technology ecosystem. As a leading provider of customer loyalty and marketing automation solutions to cannabis retailer and brands, we are well positioned to be a consolidator of a highly fragmented technology ecosystem. Our growth strategy is informed by our clients’ needs, and we have meaningful visibility into such needs as a result of the wealth of data our platform provides. We plan to 
create significant value by leveraging consumer purchasing and feedback data across multiple new vertical software offerings across loyalty, data analytics, and, when legally permissible, online ordering and payments.
We assembled a highly experienced senior management team to execute on our strategy. Our Chief Executive Officer and Founder, Jeffrey Harris, has over 35 years of deep industry experience and has successfully founded loyalty marketing businesses in the past. Our Chief Financial Officer, Paul Sykes, has over 20 years of experience as CFO of high-growth SaaS businesses in a public company environment. Our Chief Technology Officer, Navin Anand, has over 10 years of experience in leading large technology groups in SaaS and telecom organizations.
Our Growth Strategies
Our goal is to become the leading SaaS software platform to cannabis retailers and brands, providing data-driven loyalty, marketing and consumer buying experience solutions. In order to achieve our goal, we plan to implement the following organic and M&A growth strategies along with expanding in keeping with the changing regulatory landscape in the U.S.
Expansion Within Existing Retailers and Brand Customers
As of today, we service approximately 1,300 retailer and brand clients with approximately 3,000 retail locations, which is comprised of most of the largest multi-state cannabis companies and a significant number of single-state operators. Our excellent reputation in the cannabis market and comprehensive solutions offering provide us with the opportunity to expand our footprint and grow these accounts via up-selling and cross-selling. We grow alongside our clients via a “flywheel” effect as we benefit from the growth of their businesses and expansion of their customer base, which is, in turn, enabled by their use of our platform. We have a track record of using our comprehensive product offerings and results-driven proposition to grow our relationships with clients and drive revenue.
We also plan to grow our business by expanding accounts with existing clients that may not have initially leveraged our platform for all of their locations. Our clients realize significant returns on investment and increased customer engagement, which has historically driven the success of our land and expand strategy. In addition, we expect to further our penetration with existing clients as they enter new markets, as our platform will touch more end-customers and gather more actionable data.
Further Penetrate Existing Markets
We plan to leverage and expand our existing sales force and marketing strategy to acquire additional cannabis retailers and brands as new clients. We have a successful track record of consistently adding new clients. As existing markets in legalized states expand and cannabis becomes more widely used, we believe our existing presence positions us to continue to gain market share. We believe that the continued growth of the cannabis market and evolution of regulation, both in terms of legalizing recreational and medical use cannabis (as described below) as well as regarding communications and advertisements, will drive further adoption of our platform.
New Medical and Recreational Markets
As an increasing number of states in the U.S. legalize medical cannabis use or transition from medical to recreational cannabis use, a significant growth opportunity presents itself as the number of retailers, the consumer base and total spend all increase. We have historically been responsive as a first-mover into new medical and adult-use markets as they become legal, which gives us a significant competitive advantage to grow as state by state legalization evolves. We believe our deep understanding of the space coupled with our experienced sales force will enable us to quickly enter and execute in new markets and capture new business, which we can sustain via our exceptional product offerings. SpringBig entered the Canadian market in February 2021 through acquiring a Canadian business and we now provide full-servicing of our Canadian clients through our Toronto office. Although the revenues derived from the Canadian market in 2022 were immaterial, we are experiencing significant growth in the number of clients as the market continues to develop in Canada.
New Features and Functionality
We intend to continue investing in and developing our technology capabilities to offer our clients more advanced and comprehensive solutions. This will help enable us to extend our platform beyond our core offering which presents significant upsell opportunities. Some of these future offerings may include e-commerce, data and analytics, programmatic advertising, budtender education, payments (when legally permissible), product referral automation, and commerce automation (in-store kiosks).
Monetization of GMV
Approximately $7.5 billion of GMV is currently processed by the retailers that are on our platform. Through our entrenched position with retailers delivering mission critical messaging and loyalty solutions, we believe we are well-positioned to monetize a portion of GMV through payments and reward points. We plan to capture a portion of this spend through the SpringBig rewards wallet solution that our current clients utilize to manage their rewards program. Additionally, with over 40 million consumers and 19 POS integrations, we have access to a wealth of data that drive our proprietary insights. While these integrations assist in our ability to offer feedback to our customers, these commercial relationships do not represent a material amount of SpringBig’s revenues, constitute a material amount of shared revenue, or constitute a material distribution source for SpringBig. However, we believe there is a path to monetize this data and create new revenue opportunities.
Brands
We expect brand revenue to drive a significant part of our growth going forward, and we are focused on capturing a portion of the over 5,000 brands that are in the cannabis space today. We rolled out the SpringBig brands offering in 2020, which has allowed us to grow spend across our client base. As the cannabis industry matures, we believe the continued proliferation of branded products will meaningfully drive their sales and marketing spend to the cannabis industry, with a trajectory that will surpass that of retailers in the future. As brands grow in scale and become nationally recognizable, we are well positioned to capture a significant share of the communication, engagement and loyalty dollars spent by brands and therefore Brands clients will start to represent a more significant proportion of SpringBig’s total revenue.
M&A
As a leading provider of customer loyalty and marketing automation solutions to cannabis retailer and brands, we have differentiated insights into the critical needs of the cannabis industry. Our M&A strategy is informed by our client feedback, and we have identified the following needs that guide our M&A strategic focus:
•Cannabis retailers and brands lack actionable data and need better insight and recommendation technology.
•Purpose-built marketing technology and targeting is necessary to improve consumer acquisition and retention.
•The cannabis industry lacks robust fintech solutions, including processing of payments and consumer credit.
The cannabis technology space is highly fragmented, and we believe that we are well positioned to be a leading consolidator. We intend to explore M&A opportunities in adjacencies that address our client’s critical needs, and enable us to expand our product and service offerings, expand our geographic reach, increase our scale and realize material revenue and cost synergies. We are well positioned to consolidate the technology ecosystem with clear strategic rationale and value creation across loyalty, data analytics, online ordering, and, when legally permissible, POS/payment opportunities. 
Sales
Our sales team is primarily based out of our Boca Raton, Florida headquarters with additional team members in our Canadian office in Toronto, Ontario and client services support staff at both these locations and in Seattle, Washington to assist new and existing clients. As of December 31, 2022, of the 126 people we employed, 64 individuals focused exclusively on selling and client service. Our sales force is well versed in our offerings, including consumer facing, retailer platform, and brand platform products.
As we continue to scale, we expect to continue to recognize significant efficiencies with our sales effort. Currently, our primary focus revolves around converting inbound leads, as cannabis retailers and brands look to join our platform upon beginning their operations. We also utilize state cannabis regulators’ lists of licensees to internally generate client leads.
Marketing
Similar to our sales efforts, we expect to continue to achieve marketing efficiency as we scale our business. We believe our platform’s scale and strong customer loyalty market themselves, however we still intend to implement a variety of marketing efforts to attract additional retailers and brands not yet on our platform. Marketing efforts include multiple strategies designed to attract and retain both retail and brands subscribers.
Technology
We invested significantly to create a fully integrated technology stack that connects the three categories of participants in the cannabis ecosystem, namely the customers, retailers, and brands. By partnering with other industry leaders through various data analytics, e-commerce and POS platforms, we help to enhance engagement, analytics, and create a truly omni-channel experience for our clients and their customers.
Our suite of SaaS-based solutions provides cutting-edge technologies, and we continue to be the database of record for over a thousand cannabis businesses, with customer profiles being created first through our loyalty platform, and through integration of our platform with POS systems, where we can collect crucial data points through POS transactions. Below is a summary of how our technology supports our clients:
•Powerful POS Integration Sync: Powerful POS integrations allow us to provide real-time redemptions for both loyalty rewards and promotional offers, real-time campaign analytics, and deep transaction data.
•Customizable Permission Settings: Our platform enables clients to establish their own levels of user permissions for their retail and marketing staff to ensure the correct people have the correct access to data and marketing tools.
•Datahub: The robust data warehouse provides clients with access to all of their data and allows them to create their own insights.
•Insight Data Dashboards: Our customizable dashboards help clients conveniently visualize the most meaningful data and organize it for easy review.
•Budz: Our customer referral engine, allows retailers’ best customers to become brand ambassadors by referring new customers to their favorite stores.
•Feedback by SpringBig: Our customer feedback tool allows retailers to capture post-transaction feedback about their store, products, and staff.
•Autoconnect: Allow retailers to reach their consumers at critical stages during the consumer buying journey including win-back, abandon cart, and purchase behavior messaging.
Revenue Concentration
We have a diversified client base of approximately 1,300 clients with approximately 3,000 retail locations. No single client accounted for more than 11% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022, and 11% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our top 10 clients accounted for 27% and 24% of total revenue over the same periods. In addition, our revenue is well-diversified across the U.S. and Canada. No single state or province generated more than 15% our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. We do not currently generate a material amount of revenue in Canada.
Research & Development
We conduct concerted product development efforts focused on implementing new, value-add features to our platform, as well as developing new solutions that increase functionality, data-driven actionable insights and enhance ease of use throughout the customer journey. We expect our research and development expenses to remain consistent as a percentage of total revenue with increased growth continuing to support product enhancements.
Seasonality
We have not experienced a significant impact on our results due to seasonality. However, our clients may experience seasonality in their businesses that, in turn, can impact the revenue generated from them. Our business may become more seasonal in the future and historical patterns in our business may not be a reliable indicator of future performance.
Competition
Our direct competitors for various elements of our offerings and services include businesses both within and outside of the cannabis industry that are specifically focused on marketing and customer engagement, commerce and POS solutions or SaaS software, as well as companies focused on technology solutions focused on the cannabis industry.
We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include: the scale of our operations in all states that have legalized cannabis in some form and the ability to be a first mover in future new markets, the ability to offer comprehensive services across customer relationship management (“CRM”) and marketing software, the ability to support client promotions and the building of loyalty with end-consumers and increase retention, the ability to collect and analyze consumer data and feedback (and providing clients with actionable insights for marketing purposes), and effective communications and marketing to end-customers. We believe we compete favorably based on these factors.
For additional information about the risks to our business related to competition, see the section captioned “Risk Factors—Risks Related to SpringBig’s Business and Industry—We currently face intense competition in marketing and advertising services available to our clients, and we expect competition to further intensify as the cannabis industry continues to evolve.”
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property and proprietary rights are valuable assets that are important to our business. In our efforts to safeguard our copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and other intellectual property rights worldwide, we rely on a combination of federal, state, common law and international rights in the jurisdictions in which we operate.
We have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our brand names in the United States. As of December 31, 2022, we have been issued trademark registrations in the United States, covering among other marks, “SpringBig.”
We also rely on non-disclosure agreements, invention assignment agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, or license agreements with employees, independent contractors, consumers, software providers and other third parties, which protect and limit access to and use of our proprietary intellectual property.
Though we rely, in part, upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees, as well as the functionality and frequent enhancements to our platform are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.
Circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. For more information, see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to SpringBig’s Intellectual Property.”
Employees and Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, we had 126 full-time employees, including employees focused on engineering, client success, corporate development, brands, digital message and general and administrative and professional services. We also engage independent contractors to supplement our permanent workforce. 114 employees are located in the United States and 12 employees are located in Canada.
We believe that being able to attract and retain top talent is both a strategic advantage for SpringBig and necessary to realize our objectives for our business. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we have not experienced any work stoppages.
Corporate Information
We were originally formed on January 24, 2020 under the name “Tuatara Capital Acquisition Corporation,” as a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company, incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, amalgamation, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. On June 13, 2022, in anticipation of the consummation of the previously announced business combination among Tuatara, Merger Sub and Legacy SpringBig, Tuatara changed its jurisdiction of incorporation by deregistering as a Cayman Islands exempted company and continuing and domesticating as a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware and it then changed its name to SpringBig Holdings, Inc.
