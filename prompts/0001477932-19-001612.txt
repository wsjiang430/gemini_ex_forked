ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
 
Throughout this document we use the following terms: AqualyteTM, ConsERVTM, NanoClearTM, PolyCoolTM and NanoAirTM, all of which are unregistered trademarks of the Company.
 
Overview
 
Dais Corporation (“Dais”, “us,” “we,”, the “Company”) is a nano-structured polymer technology materials company having developed and now commercializing products using its family of nanomaterial called Aqualyte. The first commercial product is called ConsERV, a fixed plate energy recovery ventilator which we believe is useful in meeting building indoor fresh air requirements while saving energy and lowering emissions for most forms of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment. The second commercial product is NanoClear, a water clean-up process useful in the creation of potable water from most forms of contaminated water including industrial process waste water (petrochemical, steel, etc.) sea, brackish, or waste water. We continue to develop other nano-structured polymer technology applications in HVAC/Refrigeration, energy, food services and waste water treatment industries.
Corporate History
 
We were incorporated as a New York corporation on April 8, 1993 as Dais Corporation. The Company was formed to develop new, cost-effective polymer materials for various applications, including providing a lower cost membrane material for Polymer Electrolyte Membrane fuel cells. We believe our research on materials science has yielded technological advances in the field of selective ion transport polymer materials.
 
In December 1999, the Company purchased the assets of Analytic Power Corporation, a corporation founded in 1984 to provide design, analysis, and systems integration services in the field of fuel cells, fuel processors, and integrated fuel cell power systems. Subsequently, on December 13, 1999, the Company changed its name to Dais Analytic Corporation.
 
In March 2002, the Company sold substantially all of its fuel cell assets to Chevron, a large U.S. oil company for a combination of cash and the assumption by such company of certain of the Company’s obligations. Subsequently, the Company focused on expanding its nano-structured polymer platform, having already identified the Energy Recovery Ventilator (“ERV”) application as our first commercial product.
 
In November of 2018 the board of directors unanimously voted to change the name of the Company from Dais Analytic Corporation to Dais Corporation (the “Name Change”). The Name Change took effect with FINRA on February 27, 2019.
 
Our Technology
 
We use proprietary nanotechnology to reformulate thermoplastic materials called polymers. Nanotechnology involves studying and working with matter on an ultra-small scale. Polymers are chemical, plastic-like compounds used in diverse products such as Dacron, Teflon, and polyurethane. A thermoplastic is a material that is plastic or deformable, melts to a liquid when heated and to a brittle, glassy state when cooled sufficiently. These reformulated polymers have properties that allow them to be used in unique ways. We transform polymers from a hard, water impermeable substance into a material which water and similar liquids can, under certain conditions, diffuse (although there are no openings in the material) as molecules as opposed to liquid water. Water and similar liquids penetrate the thermoplastic material at the molecular level without oxygen and other atmospheric gases penetrating the material. It is believed this selectivity is dependent on the size and type of a particular molecule. We call this specialized material Aqualyte.

Our Products
 
AqualyteTM
 
Aqualyte membrane is the foundation of the Dais product line. It is made from commercially available polymer resin in flake form and industrial grade solvents which are mixed together using a proprietary process involving heat, industrial equipment, and solvents. The resin and the solvents are commercially available from any number of chemical supply houses, or firms such as Dow. Our process changes the molecular properties of the starting polymer resins such that in their final form they selectively allow molecules through the plastic, including water molecules. 
 
The Company invented and patented a disruptive platform plastic material technology called Aqualyte with carefully tailored properties for use in air, energy and water applications. This modified block co-polymer membrane with a nanoscale structure serves as the foundation of the Dais product line. It is a non-porous nanomaterial that selectively and efficiently transports moisture through a solid membrane and blocks passage of most gases and volatile compounds. The membrane is robust and durable with no pores to clog and no bacterial or fungal growth. We began selling Aqualyte in 2018 to strategic customers and continue to have growing sales of Aqualyte. We project even further growth in this area in the fourth quarter of 2018 and beyond. 
 
The Company continues to develop next generation versions of our Aqualyte material by adding new features to, and improving the manufacturability, of the nanomaterial. These and other improvements allow Aqualyte to serve a wider variety of uses in the ConsERV and NanoClear target markets. Aqualyte is the underlying technology for our family of products, including ConsERV, fixed-plate Energy Recovery Ventilators (ERVs), and NanoClear, a high-performance contaminated water cleaning process. Aqualyte represents the basis for a broad class of materials with unique features precisely managed by engineered processes. Features of the Aqualyte technology include the ability to create hermetic composite membranes possessing ion conduction, high moisture transfer and high molecular selectivity. Our engineering process manages these features to offer differentiated products like ConsERV and NanoClear that are targeting worldwide needs in the clean air, energy efficiency and clean water markets.
 
The Company sells Aqualyte to companies that use the product to manufacture value-added components and systems that take advantage of its characteristics.  In 2017, Dais signed a multi-year agreement with The Haier Group (the “Haier Supply Agreement” described below) that led to increased sales of Aqualyte to Haier for use in their products during 2018 and projected to grow in 2019 and beyond.  In addition, during 2018, Dais sold Aqualyte to multiple customers for use in ventilation and HVAC uses. These sales are expected to continue in 2019.
 
ConsERVTM
 
We continue widening the channels of commercialization for the ConsERV product. ConsERV is an HVAC energy conservation product which should, according to various tests, save an average of up to 30% on HVAC ventilation air operating costs, lower CO2 emissions and allow HVAC equipment to be up to 30% smaller, reducing peak energy usage by up to 20% while simultaneously improving indoor air quality. This product makes most forms of HVAC systems operate more efficiently and results, in many cases, in energy and cost savings. ConsERV generally attaches onto existing HVAC systems, typically in commercial buildings, to provide improved ventilation air within the structure. ConsERV pre-conditions the incoming air by passing over our nanotechnology polymer which has been formed into a full enthalpy heat exchanger core. The nanotechnology heat exchanger uses the stale building air that must be simultaneously exhausted to transfer heat and moisture into or out of the incoming air. For summer air conditioning, the “core” removes some of the heat and humidity from the incoming air, transferring it to the exhaust air stream thereby, under certain conditions, saving energy. For winter heating, the “core” transfers a portion of the heat and humidity into the incoming air from the exhaust air stream thereby often saving energy. 
 
ConsERV sales were negatively impacted at the beginning of 2017 from the December 2016 termination of the licensing agreement with Multistack LLC which required minimum monthly purchases of cores and related products by Multistack LLC and related entities. The Company is working diligently to re-set ConsERV sales in the effected North American market with initiatives aimed at the architect/engineer specified sales channels as well as establishing relationships with key regional sales channels. It is believed revenues will begin to grow from this intense effort throughout 2018 and 2019. 
 
In 2018, the Company began selling its ConsERV cores and systems directly to representatives across North America. The Company negotiated exclusive arrangements with representatives in multiple regions across the US. We also continued discussions with several companies in the European Union interested in buying and distributing ConsERV cores and systems. To help us expand our capabilities in China, we have qualified a Chinese manufacturing company to produce ConsERV cores using Aqualyte membrane made in the U.S. and guided by Dais qualified manufacturing practices to meet the growing demand for ConsERV systems in Australia and South East Asia. 
 
When compared to similar competitive products, we believe, based on test results conducted by the Air-conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute (AHRI), a leading industry association, ConsERV maintains an industry leading position in the management of latent heat.

NanoClearTM

We have commercially introduced the first NanoClear membrane evaporators for pilot testing, which remove quantities of metals, acids, salt and other impurities from various contaminated water sources, producing potable water using an environmentally friendly, low maintenance design that is competitive with industry leaders in terms of electrical consumption. We constructed and operate a pilot plant installed at a local county waste water treatment facility that was commissioned in May 2013 and updated to the current generation of membrane evaporator in November 2016. This site has served as a showcase for potential commercial customers as well as a test-bed for newer materials and hardware readying for commercialization. The accumulated test data, analyzed by an independent 3rd party firm, shows the quality of the water being produced has not diminished since system start-up. The evolving NanoClear product line purifies contaminated water, created largely during cooling of key manufacturing and utility processes. These sorts of applications are the Company’s primary focus. This includes higher salt concentrations and low pH waste streams. 
 
Development efforts on a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, $1,000,000, Phase II Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) award continued throughout 2018 to develop NanoClear water cleaning technology for military use. The NanoClear funding project titled "Non-Fouling Water Reuse Technologies" uses our patented Aqualyte membrane to produce potable water from grey-water sources. The potential product improvements from this award will widen NanoClear’s applications in separating clean water from contaminated waste streams.
 
We received orders for delivery of our NanoClear industrial waste water cleaning product for pilot evaluations in multiple industries throughout 2018. The product’s core strength, supported by Company, customer, and third party generated information, is its ability to cleanup contaminated waste water created by a variety of manufacturing processes. 
 
The Company participated in several large water industry trade shows, including the June 2018 Qingdao International Conference and the September 2018 international WEFTEC expo in New Orleans. 
 
PolyCoolTM
 
PolyCool is a product in development and is believed to offer strategic advantages over existing cooling tower systems. The process water being cooled is separated from the air stream by a solid Aqualyte nanotechnology membrane that establishes a selective barrier, allowing evaporation of water molecules while preventing transmission of microbes and other contaminants. In effect, the process water is isolated in a largely closed system (similar to dry cooling technology) and initial testing shows it reduces the likelihood of dangerous germs and viruses such as Legionella becoming airborne. In-house testing has shown the ability to generate cooling effects comparable to today’s existing cooling towers while largely isolating the process water from the air stream. 
 
PolyCool systems are expected to use up to 32% less energy than a conventional cooling tower while reducing or eliminating the need for expensive chemical biocide application programs to prevent the spread of risk of spreading dangerous diseases. We believe these savings can reduce the operating expenses of a cooling tower by up 74% versus conventional technology. The demonstrated ability of Aqualyte™ to resist fouling and operate with dissolved solids levels up to 25% salinity allows PolyCool™ technology to operate with seawater, brine, or other forms of wastewater instead of consuming potable water as with conventional evaporative cooling technologies. This advantage expands the applicability of evaporative cooling into geographic regions that are suffering from water scarcity or stress. In addition, the dramatic reduction in maintenance and safety issues allows use of PolyCool™ in smaller installations with correspondingly smaller maintenance budgets and less risk tolerance, which conventionally use less energy efficient dry cooling instead of evaporative cooling.

In the quarter ending September 30, 2018, Dais initiated a new PolyCool™ evaporative condenser product as part of a two-part license agreement with the Haier Group, located in Qingdao, China. This innovative product uses the evaporation of water through an Aqualyte™ membrane to enhance the performance of refrigerant condensers Haier sells currently. The product is moving into field testing with deployment into Haier’s sales channels throughout Greater China as early as the last quarter of 2019.
 
Given the results of PolyCool we began speaking with leaders in the world-wide cooling tower industry seeking to quality a strategic OEM partner to move ahead with Dais to bring this evolutionary product to market addressing multiple industry needs. 
 
Strategic Partnerships
 
The Company recently (September 2018) announced that we entered into a second definitive two-part, license agreement with the Haier Group of Qingdao, China for a new product for Haier’s HVAC cooling systems. The new product is anticipated to have a significant revenue impact for Dais, projected to be $73 million or more annually when successfully field tested and fully deployed. Revenues for Dais could begin as early as the last quarter of 2019. The product is an innovative PolyCool™ condensing unit being incorporated into a commercial Haier cooling line that is planned to be deployed into Haier’s Greater China sales and distribution channels.
 
In July of 2017, Dais first entered into a multi-year, exclusive license agreement with the Haier Group to provide its Aqualyte nanomaterials for use in select refrigeration products. This first agreement has already generated increasing quarterly revenue for Dais and should continue to expand with full roll‑out expected by mid-2019. Dais projects this first agreement alone for refrigeration products should ultimately generate over $10 million in annual revenues. Haier’s use of Dais’s Aqualyte material follows a growing world-wide trend reported by Market Insight Reports (July 18, 2018) that states global adoption of mature nanotechnology materials continues to grow and is on track to reach $90.5 billion by 2021 from $39.2 billion in 2016 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.2%, from 2016 to 2021. Dais was listed as one of the companies by Market Insight Reports along with BASF, Bayer AG, Dow Chemical, and others. 
 
Also, in July 2017, we signed a 7-year, non-exclusive agreement with the Menred Group, China, to provide our Aqualyte moisture transfer nanomaterial for us in a new line of Menred energy recovery ventilators (ERV) to be sold in the growing Chinese HVAC market. This is projected to yield over $1.2 million in sales in 2019.
 
We continue to explore new opportunities with several companies in North America, the European Union and China interested in buying and distributing ConsERV cores, Aqualyte membrane, NanoClear and PolyCool modules. To help us expand our capabilities in China, we have qualified several Chinese manufacturing companies to produce materials and components for us, guided by Dais qualified manufacturing practices to meet the growing demand for products in China and the U.S. Having components manufactured in Asia supports our objective of expanding our distribution in the Asian market at projected lower costs and faster order fulfillment. 
 
Orders are already being generated from these agreements, and we expect them to increase as we expand and add new strategic partnerships along the way. The new orders include sales of nanomaterials and components for NanoClear industrial waste water treatment, and ConsERV for heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC). We expect these new orders to convert to increase in revenue later this year, as we address expansion in our supply chain to scale-up production of our proprietary products. 
 
Our Patents
 
We own the rights to fourteen U.S. patents, four Chinese patents, one Hong Kong patent, two U.S. patent applications, and five Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) applications. National stage applications based on one of the PCT applications have resulted in a patent being issued in the U.S., China, and Hong Kong. National stage applications based on a second PCT application have resulted in a patent being issued in both the U.S. and China. National stage applications based on a third PCT application have resulted in the issuance of a U.S. patent with a further application pending in Hong Kong. National stage applications based on the remaining two PCT applications have resulted in the issuance of two U.S. patents. Divisional applications based on two of the above mentioned PCT applications have been filed in China and Hong Kong. National stage applications based on the co-owned PCT application have resulted in one U.S. patent. These patents relate to, or are applications of, our nano-structured polymer materials that perform functions such as ion exchange and modification of surface properties. The polymers are selectively permeable to polar materials, such as water, in molecular form. Selective permeability allows these materials to function as a nano-filter in various transfer applications. These materials are made from base polymer resins available from a number of commercial firms worldwide and possess what we believe to be some unique and controllable properties, such as:

· | Selectivity: Based on our research, we believe that when the polymer is made there are small channels created that are 5 to 30 nanometers in diameter. There are two types of these channels: hydrophilic (water permeable), and hydrophobic (water impermeable). The channels can be chemically tuned to be selective for the ions or molecules they transfer. The selectivity of the polymer can be adjusted to efficiently transfer water molecules from one face to the other using these channels.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | High transfer rate: Based on in-house testing protocols and related results, we have found that the channels created when casting the materials into a nano-structured membrane have a transfer rate of water, or flux, greater than 90% of an equivalent area of an open tube. This feature is fundamental to the material’s ability to transfer moisture at the molecular level while substantially allowing or disallowing the transfer of certain other substances at a molecular level. 
· | Unique surface characteristic: The materials offer a surface characteristic that we believe inhibits the growth of bacteria, fungus and algae and prevents adhesives from attaching. 

 
The company also owns multiple utility patents that cover inventions that are new, improvements and useful processes including the design and fabrication of devices or approaches that use properties of the polymers described above for HVAC, energy, food preservation and water treatment applications.

We have provisional and patent applications in the following areas: Energy Storage Devices, Enthalpy Core Applications and Construction, and Water Treatment and Desalination.
 
The following is a partial list of the patent applications publicly visible:
 

1. | WO 2011/085197 - Energy storage devices including a solid multilayer electrolyte 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | WO/2017/062812A1 – Evaporative chilling systems and methods using a selective transfer membrane
3. | WO/2018/0320988A1 – Compact membrane-based heat and mass exchanger 

 
Patents may or may not be granted on any of the above applications. We also seek to protect our proprietary intellectual property, including intellectual property that may not be patented or patentable, in part by entering into confidentiality agreements with our current and prospective strategic partners and employees.
 
Manufacturing
 
The Company currently assembles ConsERV and NanoClear cores and modules while Aqualyte fabrication is outsourced. For future expansion and high-volume scale-up, the Company has made solid progress in 2018 to establish a robust supply chain with strategic partners having existing multiple channel access to markets – or with qualified outsourced firms. We use a blended “out-sourced – in-house” model for material, component and assembly needs. We do not have long term contractual relationships with any of our manufacturers or vendors. There are no subassemblies or components that could not be purchased from alternative suppliers. Purchases to date of raw materials and related services have been on a purchase order basis using non-disclosure agreements.
Customers and Suppliers
 
For Aqualyte membrane the Company has signed a license agreement with Haier for use in crisper drawers in new refrigerators. We also entered into an agreement with Aperia Solutions (www.aperia.com) to provide membrane for use as a tire inflation product in North America and Europe. We are providing Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) with Aqualyte membrane for use in Energy Recovery Ventilators and other industrial applications. For ConsERV the Company has a multi-year license agreement with Menred to increase the market in China while we are working with North American OEMs to provide full systems and cores to end users through sales representatives. For NanoClear, the Company is working with third party turnkey providers to build and operate fully functional systems for pilot testing of the treatment of industrial waste water. We are dependent on third parties to manufacture the key components needed for our nano-structured based materials and of the value-added products made with these materials. We require our suppliers to provide components in a timely manner, and to meet the Company’s quality, quantity and cost requirements or technical specifications with acceptable terms. Certain of the components or the processes of the Company’s suppliers are proprietary. If the Company was ever required to replace any of its suppliers, it should be able to obtain comparable components from alternative suppliers at comparable costs, but this would create delays in production.

Research and Development
 
Expenditures for research, development and engineering of products are expensed as incurred. We incurred research and development costs of $318,358 and $467,524 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We account for proceeds received from government funding for research as a reduction in research and development costs. We recorded proceeds against research and development expenses on the Statements of Operations of $64,894 and $150,912 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Sales and Marketing Strategies
 
We have secured and continue to discuss relationships with other leading industry HVAC manufacturers, HVAC product distributors, energy service companies and ERV manufacturers outside of North and South America. In addition, we are discussing relationships for use of our ConsERV products in other applications outside of energy recovery ventilation world-wide. 
 
The Company is focused on creating alliances with companies having strong, existing channel presence or expertise in the target industries, notably for ConsERV and NanoClear. We are using the data and experience of initial sales in the China market to focus on growing NanoClear revenues in North America. We intend to bring industry seasoned talent into the Company at the appropriate time to further drive market development, revenue growth and guide future product feature improvement needs. 
 
Competition and Barriers to Entry
 
We believe the efficacy of our value-added products and technology has the ability to decrease sales of competing products, thus taking business away from more established firms using older technology. We believe that our ConsERV product may become a functional component of newer, more efficient OEM products. A key challenge is to educate channel decision makers of the benefits of products made using our materials and processes to overcome the strength of the current product sales. Armed with the growing base of operational and third-party data this education process will become routine.
 
There are a number of companies located in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Asia that have been developing and selling technologies and products in the energy recovery industry as listed below. We will experience significant competition regarding our products because certain competing companies possess greater financial and personal resources than us. Future product competitors include, but are not limited to:
 

Products | Current and Future Competitors 
----------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ConsERV | Semco, Greenheck, Venmar, Bry-Air, dPoint, CORE Energy Recovery Solutions, Renewaire, Holtop, Hoval, Klingenberg, Solar Palau, Kraton, Daikin and AirXchange. 
NanoClear | Dow, Dupont, Siemens, GE, Mitsubishi, Kraton and many small and regional companies using existing technologies. 
NanoAir | AAON, Trane, Carrier, York, Haier, Mitsubishi, LG, Electrolux, Samsung, Whirlpool, Kraton and Daikin. 
PolyCool | Evapco, Baltimore Air Coil, SPX Technologies, Brentwood Industries, Cooling Tower Systems, Whaley Products, and Paltech. Some of the large Air Conditioner manufacturing companies also produce cooling tower systems i.e. Trane and Carrier.

 
We believe that the combination of our nano-material platform’s characteristics (high selectivity, high flux rate, manufacturability, et al.) and growing patent position forms competitive advantages, which may allow us time to execute our business plan. The majority of our competitors may experience barriers to entry in these markets primarily related to the lack of similarly performing proprietary materials and processes.
 
The unique characteristics of our NanoClear product means we produce very pure water (TDS <10ppm) with a single module with little or no fouling of the Aqualyte material. Competitors require multiple processes to obtain similar water purity levels and frequent cleaning procedures such as back flushing to remove fouling buildup. The requirement for multiple processes and the tendency to foul increase capital expenditures and operating costs for our competitors and limit the markets where they can potentially be applied relative to NanoClear.
 
Working with Chinese early adopters of NanoClear systems is allowing us to leverage our experience with customers in the United States and elsewhere around the world projected to aid in more quickly growing long term sustainable revenues.
