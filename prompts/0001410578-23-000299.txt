Overview
We are engaged in the research and development of targeted, non-systemic therapies for the treatment of patients with gastrointestinal (“GI”) diseases. Non-systemic therapies are drugs that act locally, i.e. in the intestinal lumen, skin or mucosa, without reaching an individual’s systemic circulation.
We are developing our product candidates for a host of GI diseases where there are significant unmet clinical needs and limited therapeutic options, resulting in painful, life threatening and discomforting consequences for patients. Our mission is to help protect the health and restore quality of life for the millions of people afflicted by these GI diseases.
We are currently focused on developing our pipeline of gut-restricted GI clinical product candidates, including the biologic adrulipase (formerly MS1819), a recombinant lipase enzyme designed to enable the digestion of fats and other nutrients, and niclosamide, an oral small molecule with anti-inflammatory properties.
Our adrulipase programs are focused on the development of an oral, non-systemic, biologic capsule for the treatment of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (“EPI”) in patients with cystic fibrosis (“CF”) and chronic pancreatitis (“CP”). Our goal is to provide CF and CP patients with a safe and effective therapy to control EPI that is non-animal derived and offers the potential to dramatically reduce their daily pill burden. In November 2022 we filed a Phase 2b investigational new drug (“IND”) amendment for a bridging study using a new enteric microgranule formulation of adrulipase with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). We initiated the Phase 2b monotherapy trial during the first quarter of 2023 and expect topline data in the third quarter of 2023.
Our niclosamide programs leverage proprietary oral and topical formulations to address multiple GI conditions, including inflammatory bowel diseases (“IBD”) indications. In 2022 we advanced two separate Phase 2 clinical programs of our niclosamide formulations, including FW-COV for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (“COVID-19”) GI infections, and FW-UP for ulcerative proctitis (“UP”) and ulcerative proctosigmoiditis (“UPS”).
We announced the completion of enrollment in the FW-COV trial in January 2022 and topline results in August 2022. In September 2022 we announced that we would no longer pursue the anti-viral COVID-GI clinical indication as a result of the mixed results from the FW-COVID-19 trial. Additionally, we are devoting fewer resources to the FW-UP/UPS niclosamide program due to inconclusive data from a small Phase 2 trial in Europe, the need for a new FDA-IND cleared protocol, and capital constraints.
We are continuing to develop FW-ICI-AC for Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-associated colitis (“ICI-AC”) and diarrhea in advanced stage oncology patients and have received FDA clearance for an IND application for this program. We are also continuing two pre-IND programs of our niclosamide therapies for additional IBD indications, including FW-UC for ulcerative colitis (“UC”) and FW-CD for Crohn’s disease (“CD”).
Each drug candidate and clinical program is described below.
Adrulipase
Adrulipase is the active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) derived from Yarrowia lipolytica, an aerobic yeast naturally found in various foods such as cheese and olive oil that is widely used as a biocatalyst in several industrial processes. Adrulipase is a secreted lipase naturally produced by Yarrowia lipolytica, known as LIP2, that we are developing through recombinant DNA technology for the treatment of EPI associated with CF and CP. Lipases are enzymes that help with the digestion of lipids and fat.

We previously held the exclusive right to commercialize adrulipase in the U.S., Canada, South America (excluding Brazil), Asia (excluding China and Japan), Australia, New Zealand and Israel pursuant to a sublicense from Laboratories Mayoly Spindler SAS (“Mayoly”) under the Joint Research and Development Agreement (“JDLA”), which also granted us joint commercialization rights for Brazil, Italy, China and Japan. In March 2019, we purchased all rights, title and interest in and to adrulipase from Mayoly pursuant to the Mayoly Asset Purchas Agreement (“APA”), provided, however, Mayoly retained exclusive commercial rights in France and Russia.
Background
The pancreas is both an endocrine gland that produces several important hormones, including insulin, glucagon, and pancreatic polypeptide, as well as a digestive organ that secretes pancreatic juice containing digestive enzymes that assist with the absorption of nutrients and digestion in the small intestine.
The targeted indication of adrulipase is the treatment of EPI, which is observed when the exocrine functions of the pancreas are below 10% of normal. The symptomatology of EPI is essentially due to the deficiency of pancreatic lipase, an enzyme that hydrolyses triglycerides into monoglycerides and free fatty acids. The pancreatic lipase enzymatic activity is hardly compensated by extra-pancreatic mechanisms, because gastric lipase has nearly no lipolytic activity in the pH range of the intestine. On the other hand, when they are impaired, the pancreatic amylase and protease (enzymes that break up carbohydrates (starches) and proteins, respectively) activities can be compensated by the salivary amylase, the intestinal glycosidase, the gastric pepsin, and the intestinal peptidases, all of which are components of the gastric juice secreted by the stomach walls. Lipid maldigestion due to lipase deficiency is responsible for weight loss, steatorrhea featured by greasy diarrhea, and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies (i.e. A, D, E and K vitamins).
CP, the most common cause of EPI, is a long-standing inflammation of the pancreas that alters its normal structure and functions. In the U.S., its prevalence rate is of 42 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, resulting in approximately 132,000 cases. Approximately 60% of patients affected with CP display EPI, resulting in approximately 90,000 patients requiring substitution therapy in the U.S. In Western societies, CP is caused by chronic alcoholic consumption in approximately 55-80% of cases. Other relatively frequent etiologies include the genetic form of the disease that is inherited as an autosomal dominant condition with variable penetrance, pancreatic trauma and idiopathic causes.
CF, another dominant etiology of EPI, is a severe genetic disease associated with chronic morbidity and life-span decrease of most affected individuals. In most Caucasian populations, CF prevalence is of 7-8 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, but is less common in other populations, resulting in more than 30,000 affected individuals in the U.S. and more than 70,000 affected individuals worldwide. CF is inherited as monogenic autosomal recessive disease due to the defect at a single gene locus that encodes the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator protein, or CFTR, a regulated chloride channel. Mutation of both alleles of this chloride channel gene results in the production of thick mucus, which causes a multisystem disease of the upper and lower respiratory tracts, digestive system, and the reproductive tract. The progressive destruction of the pancreas results in EPI that is responsible for malnutrition and contributes to significant morbidity and mortality. About 80-90% of patients with CF develop EPI, resulting in approximately 25,000-27,000 patients in the U.S. that require substitution therapy.
Current treatments for EPI stemming from CP and CF rely on porcine (pig derived) pancreatic enzyme replacement therapies (“PERTs”), which have been on the market since the late 1800s. PERTs are typically comprised of three digestive enzymes; lipases, proteases, and amylases. The PERT market is well established with estimated sales of approximately $1.4 billion in 2019 in the U.S. and has been growing for the past five years at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 20%. In spite of their long-term use, however, PERTs suffer from poor stability, formulation problems, possible transmission of conventional and non-conventional infectious agents due to their animal origins, and possible adverse events at high doses in patients with CF and limited effectiveness.
Pre-Clinical Program
The efficacy of adrulipase has been investigated in normal minipigs, which are generally considered to be a relevant model for digestive drug development because of their physiological similarities with humans and their omnivorous diet. Experimental pancreatitis was induced by pancreatic duct ligation, resulting in severe EPI with baseline CFA around 60% post-ligature. CFA is a measurement obtained by quantifying the amount of fat ingested orally over a defined time period and subtracting the amount eliminated in the stool to ascertain the amount of fat absorbed by the body. Pigs were treated with either adrulipase or enteric-coated PERTs, both administered as a single-daily dose.

-2-



At doses ranging from 10.5 to 211 mg, adrulipase increased the CFA by +25 to +29% in comparison to baseline (p<0.05 at all doses), whereas the 2.5 mg dose had milder activity. Similar efficacy was observed in pigs receiving 100,000 U lipase of enteric-coated porcine pancreatic extract. These findings demonstrate the in vivo activity of adrulipase in a relevant in vivo model at a level similar to the PERTs at dosages of 10.5mg or greater.
To date, two non-clinical toxicology studies have been conducted. Both show that adrulipase lipase is clinically well tolerated at levels up to 1000mg/kg in rats and 250 mg/kg in minipigs up to 13 weeks. Adrulipase is therefore considered non-toxic in both rodent and non-rodent species up to a maximum feasible dose of 1,000 mg/kg/day in the rats over six months of administration.
Clinical Program
We are developing adrulipase for two principal therapeutic indications: (i) children and adults affected by CF, and (ii) adult patients with CP. We have determined to initially pursue the adult indication in CF.
Chronic Pancreatitis
During 2010 and 2011, a phase 1/2a clinical trial of adrulipase was conducted in conjunction with Mayoly in a single center in France. The study was an exploratory study mainly designed to investigate the safety of adrulipase and was a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel clinical trial in 12 patients affected with CP or pancreatectomy and severe EPI. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was defined as the relative change in steatorrhea (an established surrogate biomarker of EPI correction) in comparison to baseline. The study found that adrulipase was well tolerated with no serious adverse events. Only two adverse events were observed: constipation (two patients out of eight with adrulipase) and hypoglycemia (two patients out of eight with adrulipase, and one patient out of four with placebo). A non-statistically significant difference of the primary endpoint, possibly due to the small group size, was found between the two groups both in intention-to-treat, a group that included three patients who received the in-patient facility study diet but did not fulfill the protocol’s inclusion criteria, and per-protocol analysis. This study was not designed, nor did it aim, to demonstrate statistically significant changes of CFA or steatorrhea under adrulipase.
We received regulatory approval in Australia and New Zealand in 2016, with the addition of a 2018 regulatory approval in France, to conduct a Phase 2 multi-center dose escalation study of adrulipase in CP and pancreatectomy. The primary endpoint of this study was to evaluate the safety of escalating doses of adrulipase in 11 CP patients. The secondary endpoint was to investigate the efficacy of adrulipase in these patients by analysis of the CFA and its change from baseline. In September 2018, we announced that in pre-planned analyses, both the study’s primary and secondary endpoints were reached with a statistically significant (p=0.002) improvement in the CFA of 21.8%, in a per protocol analysis, with the highest evaluated dose of 2,240 mg/day of adrulipase. Statistical significance of the trial results is typically based on widely used, conventional statistical methods that establishes the p-value of the results. A p-value of 0.05 or less is required to demonstrate statistical significance. As such, these CFA levels are considered to be statistically significant.
Cystic Fibrosis Monotherapy
In October 2018, the FDA cleared our IND application for adrulipase in patients with EPI due to CF. In December 2018, we initiated the Phase 2 OPTION Bridging Dose Study to investigate adrulipase in CF patients with EPI and in February 2019, we dosed the first patients. The Phase 2 OPTION Bridging Dose Study investigated the safety, tolerability and efficacy of adrulipase in a head-to-head comparison against the current PERT standard of care. The OPTION Bridging Dose Study employed a six-week non-inferiority CFA primary efficacy endpoint comparing adrulipase to PERTs.
In September 2019, we announced positive results from the OPTION Bridging Dose Study. Results showed that the primary efficacy endpoint of CFA was comparable to the CFA in a prior Phase 2 study in patients with CP, while using the same dosage of adrulipase. The dosage used in the OPTION Bridging Dose Study was 2.2 grams per day, which was determined in agreement with the FDA as a bridging dose from the highest safe dose used in the Phase 2 CP dose escalation study. Although the study was not powered for statistical significance, the data demonstrated meaningful efficacy results, with approximately 50% of the patients showing CFAs high enough to reach non-inferiority with standard PERTs. Additionally, the CNA was comparable between the adrulipase and PERT arms, 93% vs. 97%, respectively, in the OPTION Bridging Dose Study. This important finding confirms that protease supplementation is not likely to be required with adrulipase treatment. A total of 32 patients, ages 18 or older, completed the OPTION Bridging Dose Study.

In October 2019, the CFF DSMB completed its review of our final results of the OPTION Bridging Dose Study and found no safety concerns for adrulipase and supported our plan to proceed to the Phase 2b OPTION 2 Trial. In December 2019, we submitted the clinical trial protocol to the existing IND at the FDA. In April 2020, we received approval to conduct the OPTION 2 Trial in Therapeutics Development Network clinical sites in the U.S.
The OPTION 2 Trial was designed to investigate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of adrulipase (2.2 gram and 4.4 gram doses in enteric capsules) head-to-head versus the current standard of care, PERT pills. The OPTION 2 Trial was an open-label, crossover study, conducted in 15 sites in the U.S. and Europe. Enrollment included a total of 30 CF patients 18 years or older. Adrulipase was administered in enteric capsules to provide gastric protection and test for optimal delivery of enzyme to the duodenum. Patients were first be randomized into two cohorts: the adrulipase arm, where they received a 2.2 gram daily oral dose of adrulipase for three weeks; or the PERT arm, where they received their pre-study dose of PERT pills for three weeks. After three weeks, stools were collected for analysis of CFA. Patients were then crossed over for another three weeks of the alternative treatment. After three weeks of cross-over therapy, stools were again collected for analysis of CFA. A parallel group of patients was randomized and studied in the same fashion using a 4.4 gram daily dose of adrulipase. All patients were followed for an additional two weeks after completing both crossover treatments for post study safety observation. Patients were assessed using descriptive methods for efficacy, comparing CFA between adrulipase and PERT arms, and for safety.
In January 2021, we announced an additional study arm in OPTION 2 Trial using an immediate release adrulipase capsules in order to identify the optimal dose and delivery method of adrulipase. This extension phase tested patients 18 years or older, who have already completed the crossover phase, at higher doses relative to the previously conducted OPTION Bridging Dose Study. This allowed us to compare data from the existing crossover arm using enteric (delayed release) capsules with data from the new immediate release extension arm.
In March 2021 we announced topline OPTION 2 data. The trial demonstrated that adrulipase was safe and well-tolerated and data from OPTION 2, and the other adrulipase Phase 2 clinical trials, demonstrated drug activity. However, OPTION 2 did not consistently meet the primary efficacy endpoint. Some patients were able to achieve CFA at levels beyond what is required to demonstrate non-inferiority with PERT therapies, but the majority did not.
We believe that the underlying cause of the drug’s uneven efficacy performance in the OPTION 2 trial was the enteric capsule formulation. While the enteric coating protected the capsule from breaking down in the stomach acid, it also appeared to dissolve too slowly in the small intestine to release the lipase enzyme in time to aid with proper digestion and nutrient absorption.
In August 2021 we announced that we would begin development of a new enteric microgranule formulation of adrulipase. The new formulation is planned to be administered with food as an oral capsule that dissolves in the stomach and disperses acid-resistant micro-granules that thoroughly mix with food during the digestion process. The resultant mixture then passes to the small intestine where the lipase enzyme breaks up fat molecules so that they can be absorbed. We completed the reformulation work in the second half of 2022.
In November 2022 we announced that we had filed an IND amendment with the FDA for a Phase 2b bridging study with the new enteric microgranulation formulation of adrulipase. The new trial is designed to investigate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the new formulation of adrulipase. It is an open-label study that will be conducted at three sites in the U.S. A total of 12 cystic fibrosis patients, 18 years or older are expected to be enrolled. The trial design employs a dose titration strategy. Patients will be screened at baseline to ensure that they have a coefficient of fat absorption (CFA) of at least 80%. Eligible patients will then be switched from their commercial enzyme product to adrulipase. Each patient will be started on a low dose of adrulipase. If the patient is not clinically controlled, the patient will be switched to a medium dose, and if not controlled on this dose, the patient will be advanced to a high dose. The titrations will be carried out over a three-week period, after which a CFA will be obtained. End of study CFAs will be compared to the baseline CFAs in a descriptive fashion. A post treatment safety visit will be conducted one week after completing the treatment period.
Following FDA review of the IND amendment, we initiated the Phase 2b pilot monotherapy trial during the first quarter of 2023 and anticipate topline data in the third quarter of 2023.

Combination Therapy
We launched the Phase 2 Combination Trial in Hungary in July 2019 to investigate adrulipase, in combination with PERT, in CF patients who suffer from severe EPI but continue to experience clinical symptoms of fat malabsorption despite taking the maximum daily dose of PERTs. The Combination Trial is designed to investigate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of escalating doses of adrulipase (700 mg, 1120 mg and 2240 mg per day, respectively), in conjunction with a stable dose of PERTs, in order to increase CFA and relieve abdominal symptoms. In October 2020, we opened a total of five clinical sites in Turkey and dosed the first patients in November 2020. In March 2021, we reached targeted minimum enrollment of 18 patents.
We announced positive interim data on the first five patients in the Combination Trial in August 2020. The primary efficacy endpoint was met, with CFAs greater than 80% for all patients across all visits. For secondary efficacy endpoints, we observed that stool weight decreased, the number of stools per day decreased, steatorrhea improved, and body weight increased. Additionally, no serious adverse events were reported.
In August 2021, we announced topline data collected from the 20 patients enrolled in the study. The data indicated that adrulipase in combination with PERT led to clinically meaningful improvements in CFA, the primary efficacy endpoint. Patients showed an average gain of more than six percentage points from baseline, compared to the five-point improvement in CFA cited by the clinical literature as clinically significant. The study also demonstrated positive improvements in weight gain and other secondary endpoints.
We believe a combination therapy of PERT and adrulipase has the potential to: (i) correct macronutrient and micronutrient maldigestion; (ii) eliminate abdominal symptoms attributable to maldigestion; and (iii) sustain optimal nutritional status on a normal diet in CF patients with severe EPI. We developed a new enteric microgranule formulation and initiated a Ph2b monotherapy trial in the first quarter of 2023. We expect topline date in the third quarter of 2023. Depending on the results of this trial, we may elect to conduct further combination therapy trials using the new formulation.
Niclosamide
Niclosamide, a pro-inflammatory pathway inhibitor, is a prescription small molecule drug that has been safely used on millions of patients. Niclosamide is listed as an essential medicine by the World Health Organization (WHO). In the U.S., niclosamide was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in 1982 for the treatment of intestinal tapeworm infections. Niclosamide’s activity as an antihelminthic results from direct action in the intestinal lumen where it disrupts a parasitic metabolic function called oxidative phosphorylation, killing parasites. Niclosamide has been commercially available worldwide for more than 50 years as 500mg single-dose tablets intended for use in pediatric and adult populations, at a dose rate of 2g per adult or child over six years of age. No safety issues have ever been identified. In addition to its antihelminthic activity, niclosamide has demonstrated novel anti-inflammatory properties.
We believe niclosamide, and more specifically our proprietary and patent-pending micronized niclosamide formulation, has the potential to be an ideal therapeutic to treat multiple GI indications due to the following favorable properties:

(i) | it has a reduced particle size (D(90) between 5 and 9 µM) as compared to regular non-micronized niclosamide (approximately D(90) ≥ 60µM) with greater surface to solvent ratio;
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | low oral bio-availability with minimal systemic absorption / exposure;
-----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | improved dissolution with broader distribution allowing for higher local GI concentrations (up to approximately 200 times based on preclinical study results); and
------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iv) | it exhibits anti-inflammatory effects while avoiding steroid-related complications and adverse events.

Scientific Background
Recent discoveries in immune cell metabolism suggest that it may be possible to selectively target disease-causing immune cells to treat inflammatory diseases without unwanted side effects associated with broad-based immunosuppression. Research indicates that IBD, including ulcerative colitis, ulcerative proctitis/proctosigmoiditis and Crohn’s disease, is driven by pathogenic Th17 cells, which release a cascade of local cytokines that in turn cause inflammation in bowel wall tissues.
Th17 cells rely on a cellular process called oxidative phosphorylation to survive. Niclosamide is known to disrupt the oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria of pathogenic Th17 cells in a manner that selectively induces apoptosis of pathogenic Th17 cells, overcoming their inherent resistance to cell death. This effect is mild enough that it does not interfere with normal cells. By killing Th17 cells, niclosamide may reduce inflammation and calm the gut, selectively killing pathogenic, inflammatory cells while leaving healthy cells untouched.
Niclosamide has demonstrated beneficial effects in numerous cell culture studies using cells obtained by biopsy of inflamed bowel tissues from IBD patients, and also in animal models of IBD.
Our suite of proprietary, gut-restricted niclosamide product candidates are designed to target the metabolism of disease-causing Th17 cells to potentially halt or delay the progression of disease, stop flare-ups, and address patient needs at all stages of IBD, from mild to severe, and for cancer patients with ICI-AC.
Inflammatory Bowel Disease Background
IBD is an umbrella term used to describe disorders that involve chronic inflammation of the digestive track. IBD affects approximately 3 million people in the U.S. annually. IBD is divided into two main classes of gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases: (i) ulcerative colitis (UC), including ulcerative proctitis (UP) and ulcerative proctosigmoiditis (UPS), and (ii) Crohn’s Disease (CD). There are similarities between UC and CD, such as immunopathology, and equal distribution between males and females. However, there are also notable differences. UC is generally limited to the colon, while CD may occur anywhere in the small or large intestine. UC usually affects continuous mucosal surfaces, while CD is patchier, with areas of normal bowel mucosa separating the inflammatory patches. Importantly, CD often involves deep bowel tissues and can lead to fistulas into the abdominal cavity or out to the skin surface. CD requires surgical intervention more often than UC. While medical treatments for UC and CD are generally similar, CD is much less responsive.
FW-COV Program for COVID-19 GI Infections
The COVID-19 pandemic is a global public health emergency caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. An increasing volume of convergent evidence indicates that GI infection and fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 are important factors in the clinical presentation, virology and epidemiology of COVID-19. There is currently no etiological treatment for COVID-19 GI effects. As a result, we believe there is an unmet therapeutic need for safe and effective treatment of these effects.
A study published in July 2020 in Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, an American Society for Microbiology journal (Jeon et. Al, 2020) examined a small set (n=49) of FDA-approved drugs that were selected based on either having known activity against SARS-CoV or being recommended by infectious disease experts for activity against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Results from this study indicated that niclosamide was the most potent of all agents tested in a Vero cell cytopathic assay with an IC50 value of 0.28 µM. For comparison, in terms of potency, niclosamide out-performed reference compounds chloroquine, lopinavir, and remdesivir with IC50 values of 7.28, 9.12, and 11.41 µM, respectively. IC50 is a quantitative measure that indicates how much of a particular inhibitory substance (e.g. a drug) is needed to inhibit, in vitro, a given biological process or biological component by fifty percent. Thus, niclosamide is approximately 40-fold more potent in vitro than VEKLURY® (remdesivir), an antiviral drug marketed by Gilead Sciences Inc. that received FDA approval in October 2020 for use in adult and pediatric patients for the treatment of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization.
Following oral administration, niclosamide is poorly absorbed, which results in a majority of the administered dose remaining in the GI tract. We believe this basic property of niclosamide, when combined with micronized niclosamide in the drug product to accelerate dissolution, will enable this drug product to achieve pharmacologically effective concentrations of niclosamide in the GI tract while having almost no bioavailability, potentially enhancing efficacy and safety.

An IND for FW-COV micronized niclosamide for COVID-19 GI infections was cleared by the FDA in September 2020. In April 2021, we initiated our Phase 2 RESERVOIR clinical trial for the treatment of COVID-19 related GI infections. The Phase 2 RESERVOIR clinical trial is a two-part, two-arm, randomized, placebo-controlled study examining the safety and efficacy of micronized oral niclosamide tablets in patients with COVID-19 GI infection. The two primary objectives of the RESERVOIR trial are to confirm the safety of niclosamide in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 GI infection and to demonstrate efficacy in clearing the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the GI tract.
Part 1 of the trial studied 9 patients with COVID-19 and diarrhea. Patients were randomized (2:1 niclosamide: placebo), treated for 14 days and observed closely for any signs of safety issues. In September 2021, we announced positive results from an independent Data Monitoring Committee review of the interim safety data. The Data Monitoring Committee also approved initiating patient enrollment in Part 2.
Part 2 of the trial studied approximately 150 patients in the U.S., Ukraine and India with mild or moderate COVID-19. Patients were randomized to either niclosamide, 400 mg tablets, three times a day, or placebo tablets three times a day. After 14 days of treatment, patients are taken off study drugs and remain on study observation for up to 6 months. Our trial samples from the clinical trial site in Ukraine have been completed and transported out of Ukraine.
The primary efficacy measure of the RESERVOIR trial is the rate of fecal SARS-CoV-2 virus clearance (rectal swab or stool sample) assessed by RT-PCR, comparing the niclosamide arm to the placebo arm for up to six months. These long-term observation data could indicate that niclosamide treatment has the potential to improve ‘long haul’ COVID-19 symptoms by decreasing viral load in the GI tract. There is evidence to support that the GI tract may be a possible reservoir for persistence and fecal spread of COVID-19 because ACE-2, the entry receptor for COVID-19, is highly expressed on GI cells.
In January 2022, we announced completion of patient enrollment for Part 2 of the RESERVOIR trial. In April 2022 the Company announced that top-line data results from the trial were mixed. FW-COV was demonstrated to be very safe with no drug-related serious adverse events (SAEs) reported by the more than 150 patients who participated in the trial. However, the efficacy endpoint in this trial – the ability of FW-COV to remove the SARS-CoV-2 (SARS2) virus from the digestive tract as measured by viral presence in the patient’s stool – did not demonstrate statistical significance when compared to placebo. As a result, the Company decided not to further pursue niclosamide clinical studies for the anti-viral treatment of COVID-GI.
FW-UC for Ulcerative Colitis (UC)
UC is an IBD that causes inflammation and ulcers (sores) in the digestive tract. UC generally affects the innermost lining of the large intestine (colon). UC affects approximately 830,000 patients in the U.S. annually and approximately 84% or 700,000 have mild to moderate disease. The immunopathology of UC is complex and is generally considered to be caused by a dysregulated immune system. There is evidence that a hereditary trait is involved. While the cause is not known, many researchers believe that invasive bacteria or virus in the bowel wall sets off an abnormal response by local T lymphocytes. Normally, a subgroup of lymphocytes called Th17 cells protect the bowel wall from microbial invaders. However, in patients with UC, these Th17 cells become pathogenic and release a cascade of local cytokines, which in turn cause inflammation in bowel wall tissues. This persistent inflammation causes tissue damage, and clinical symptoms. Clinical symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea, which is sometimes bloody, intermittent fever, anemia, and weight loss, and symptoms usually develop over time, rather than suddenly.
Severity of UC is generally classified as mild, moderate or severe. Mild disease is treated by sulfasalazine and 5-ASA’s, most commonly mesalamine. These may be given orally or rectally and are modestly potent anti-inflammatory agents. While inexpensive and well tolerated, only about 50% of UC patients will maintain a clinical response to these agents. Non-responders or relapsers will progress to moderate or even severe disease.
Patients failing on 5-ASA’s are usually placed onto steroid therapy, such as budesonide or prednisone, risking the well-known side effects of steroids. Failing, or not tolerating steroids leads to treatment with much more potent and expensive immunosuppressive agents such as anti-TNFs, or newer agents such as Entyvio® or Xeljanz®. We believe there is an unmet medical need for a well-tolerated, effective therapeutic for patients who fail first line treatment with 5-ASAs.
Our initial clinical trial in UC involves patients with ulcerative proctitis (UP) and ulcerative proctosigmoiditis (UPS), who are being treated with a topical rectal formulation, which is currently in a Phase 1b/2a clinical trial.

-7-



We intend to commence the clinical development of FW-UC, employing an oral tablet formulation in a Phase 1 clinical trial for subjects with UC in 2023, subject to successful results from Stage 2 of the FW-UP Phase 1b/2a clinical trial.
FW-UP Program for Ulcerative Proctitis (UP) and Ulcerative Proctosigmoiditis (UPS)
UP and UPS are two types of UC, a chronic inflammatory bowel disease consisting of fine ulcerations in the inner mucosal lining of the large intestine that do not penetrate the bowel muscle wall. UPS causes inflammation in the colon and rectum, while UP is confined only to the rectum. Symptoms include weight loss, fatigue, abdominal pain and cramps, rectal pain and bleeding, and diarrhea, although constipation can also develop as the body struggles to maintain normal bowel function. UP and UPS affect approximately 200,000 patients in the U.S. annually.
UP and UPS can occur at any point throughout life, with a high occurrence in young children and then again around 40-50 years of age. Progression of this disease to ulcerative colitis, extending farther up the bowel to involve the sigmoid colon, occurs in about 30-50% of patients. UP and UPS allow convenient clinical management and observation by local sigmoidoscopy. Although there is a range of treatments to help ease symptoms and induce remission, there is no cure.
We are developing FW-UP, a niclosamide-based, small molecule anti-inflammatory inhibitor therapy in enema formulation for the potential treatment of UP and UPS. FW-UP is currently being investigated in a three-stage Phase 1b/2a clinical trial in Europe studying the safety and potential efficacy of niclosamide in patients with UP and UPS.
Stage 1 of the trial studied 17 subjects with UP who had failed first line therapy with 5-ASAs. They were treated for six weeks with low dose FW-UP niclosamide rectal enemas twice a day. Preliminary results demonstrated that FW-UP niclosamide enemas were well tolerated, with a durable therapeutic effect. The efficacy endpoint was to achieve a clinical remission, defined as a Modified Mayo Score of 2 or less. A clinical remission rate of 59% was achieved, which is higher than currently approved second line therapy with budesonide (38% to 44%).
Stage 2 of the trial is designed to study a higher dose of niclosamide enema twice daily for six-weeks. Stage 2 enrollment was initiated in September 2021 and will enroll 28 patients in a placebo-controlled study to compare FW-UP, administered as an enema twice daily at a dose of 450 mg, to placebo enemas twice daily.
In September 2022 we announced that we would devote fewer resources to the FW-UP/UPS niclosamide program due to inconclusive data from Stage 2 of the Phase 2 trial in Europe, the need for a new FDA-IND cleared protocol and capital constraints.
We plan to initiate a new Phase 2 UP/UPS trial under an FDA IND cleared protocol upon securing sufficient financial resources.
FW-ICI-AC for Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Colitis (ICI-AC)
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (“ICIs”) are monoclonal antibodies that target down-regulators of the anti-cancer immune response and have significantly affected the treatment of a variety of malignancies. However, many immune-related adverse events, especially diarrhea and colitis, limit their use. A 2019 study titled, “Immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced colitis: A comprehensive review,” published in World Journal of Clinical Cases (Sol et.al, 2019) estimated the incidence of IMC ranges from 1% to 25% depending on the type of ICI and whether they are used in combination. A 2017 study titled “Incidence of immune checkpoint inhibitor-related colitis in solid tumor patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis” published in Oncoimmunology (Wang et.al, 2017) estimated that approximately 44%, or 260,000 patients with advanced and metastatic tumors were eligible to receive ICIs. Further, approximately 30% of ICI patients develop diarrhea, which can progress to colitis. The onset of diarrhea in ICI-AC patients occurs within six to seven weeks and progressively worsens, and the progression to colitis is rapid and unpredictable.
In patients taking Yervoy® (ipilimumab), between 25% to 30% developed diarrhea and approximately 8% to 12% developed colitis, as reported in a peer-reviewed article, “Immune-checkpoint inhibitor-induced diarrhea and colitis in patients with advanced malignancies: retrospective review at MD Anderson” published in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer (Wang et. al,, 2018). Moreover, there is a treatment trend towards the use of combination ICI therapies (for example combining Yervoy® and Opdivo®), which is believed to lead to a concomitant increase in both diarrhea and colitis.

We believe there currently is no approved treatment for Grade 1 colitis. The recommended treatment for Grade 2 or more severe colitis is administration of corticosteroids, or treatment with certain immunosuppressive biologics, while withholding ICI therapy (National Cancer Institute, 2020). The impact of this colitis complication and treatment may reduce the goal of progression-free cancer survival. We believe there is an unmet medical need and an oral, non-absorbed therapeutic, such as our FW-ICI-AC niclosamide, for Grade-1 colitis (diarrhea) which may prevent progression to Grade 2 or more severe disease.
In October 2021, we received FDA IND clearance to commence our Phase 1b/2a PASSPORT ICI-AC clinical trial using an oral immediate-release tablet formulation of niclosamide for Grade 1 and Grade 2 colitis and diarrhea in oncology patients receiving treatment with ICIs.
The Phase 2a PASSPORT clinical trial is designed as a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to determine the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of FW-ICI-AC in the treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated colitis (ICI-AC) and diarrhea in advanced cancer patients. 60 patients are planned to be enrolled in the trial and divided into two arms (30 patients per arm). One arm will receive FW-ICI-AC three times daily for two weeks, while the other arm will receive placebo three times daily for two weeks. Following treatment, each patient will enter a four-week evaluation period. The primary endpoint of the trial is safety and tolerability of FW-ICI-AC. Additional endpoints will measure early signals of efficacy, including resolution of the patient’s diarrhea, sparing of steroids, and prevention of disease progression.
We plan to initiate the PASSPORT trial in the U.S. upon securing sufficient financial resources.
FW-CD for Crohn’s Disease (CD)
While the immunopathology of CD resembles that of UC, the location of disease, the response to treatment and the overall morbidity are different, as CD is more difficult to manage. Patient response to standard therapy is more variable than in UC, thus making clinical management more challenging. In UC, a reasonably clear course of disease from mild to moderate severity can be predicted based upon response to first line treatment. In CD, first line treatment often includes more immunosuppressive agents, such as steroids, immunomodulators, and anti-TNF agents as compared to the 5-ASAs used for first line in UC.
CD affects approximately 660,000 patients in the U.S. annually and approximately 76% or 500,000 have mild to moderate disease. We believe FW-CD, an oral niclosamide-based small molecule anti-inflammatory inhibitor therapy can be an important therapeutic in the treatment of mild to moderate CD, with the goal of reducing steroid and immunomodulators treatments.
We plan to initiate the PASSPORT trial in the U.S. upon securing sufficient financial resources. We intend to commence clinical development of FW-CD in a Phase 2a clinical trial, subject to the successful completion of a FW-UC Phase 1 clinical trial.

Corporate History
We were incorporated on January 30, 2014 in the State of Delaware. In May 2014, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with Protea Biosciences Group, Inc. (“Protea Group”) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Protea Biosciences, Inc. (“Protea Sub” and, together with Protea Group, “Protea”), to acquire 100% of the outstanding capital stock of AzurRx SAS (formerly ProteaBio Europe SAS), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Protea Sub, which was completed in June 2014. In October 2016, we completed an initial public offering, which allowed us to list our shares of Common Stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market.
On September 13, 2021, we completed the acquisition of First Wave Bio, Inc. (“FWB”), which became our wholly- owned subsidiary. In connection with the acquisition, AzurRx BioPharma, Inc. changed its name to First Wave BioPharma, Inc.
Effective October 26, 2022, the AzurRx SAS subsidiary was dissolved.
Intellectual Property
Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our product candidates, formulations, processes, methods and any other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our current product candidates and any future product candidates, proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents, both in the United States and abroad. However, patent protection may not afford us with complete protection against competitors who seek to circumvent our patents.
We also depend upon the skills, knowledge, experience and know-how of our management and research and development personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors. To help protect our proprietary know-how, which is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce, we currently rely and will in the future rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business.

Manufacturing
We currently outsource all manufacturing, and we intend to use our collaborators and contract development and manufacturing organizations (“CDMOs”) for the foreseeable future.
Adrulipase
Adrulipase API, including drug substance and drug product, is currently manufactured by Asymchem, Inc. at a contract facility located in Tianjin, China. Charles River Laboratories based in Malvern, Pennsylvania is responsible for maintaining our master and working cell banks. We believe there are multiple alternative contract manufacturers capable of producing the product we need for clinical trials; however, there is no guarantee that the processes are easily reproducible and transferrable.

-11-



Niclosamide
Niclosamide API is obtained by chemical synthesis and is currently manufactured by Olon SpA at a facility in Murcia, Spain. Niclosamide drug product is currently manufactured at a contract facility located in Milan, Italy owned by Monteresearch s.r.l. and at a contract facility located in Tianjin, China owned by Asymchem Inc. We believe there are multiple alternative contract manufacturers capable of producing the product we need for clinical trials; however, there is no guarantee that the processes are easily reproducible and transferrable.
Competition
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition. Many companies of all sizes, including major pharmaceutical companies and specialized biotechnology companies, are engaged in the development and commercialization of therapeutic agents designed for the treatment of the same diseases and disorders that we target. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources, larger research and development staff and more experience in the regulatory approval process. Moreover, potential competitors have or may have patents or other rights that conflict with patents covering our technologies.
Adrulipase
With respect to adrulipase, if approved, we would compete with PERTs (pancrelipase), a well-established market that is currently dominated by a few large pharmaceutical companies, including CREON® marketed by AbbVie Inc., ZENPEP® sold to Nestlé S.A. by Allergan plc. in January 2020, PANCREAZE® marketed by VIVUS, Inc. and PERTZYE® marketed by Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A. There are currently six PERT products that have been approved by the FDA for sale in the U.S. We believe our ability to compete in this market, if we are successful in developing and obtaining regulatory approval to market adrulipase, will depend on our ability (or that of a future corporate partner) to convince patients, their physicians, healthcare payors and the medical community of the benefits of using a non-animal-based product to treat EPI, as well as by addressing other shortcomings associated with PERTs, including a large pill burden.
Niclosamide
With respect to FW-COV, our oral micronized formulation of niclosamide for COVID-19 GI infections, if approved, would compete with currently approved antivirals, including Pfizer’s Inc.’s PAXLOVIDTM, Merck & Co. Inc. and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics’ molnupiravir, VEKLURY® (remdesivir) marketed by Gilead Sciences, Inc. and vaccines, including those marketed by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE, Moderna, Inc. Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca plc. There are also several therapeutic and vaccine candidates in various stages of development that may obtain regulatory approval for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19 infections. Additionally, there are currently ongoing clinical studies using niclosamide by ANA Therapeutics (acquired by NeuroBo Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), Daewoong Pharmaceuticals Co Ltd, and Union Therapeutics A/S, among others at various stages of development. We believe our approach to target COVID-19 GI infections is differentiated. We believe our ability to compete in this market, if we are successful in developing and obtaining regulatory approval to market FW-COV, will depend on our ability (or that of future corporate partners) to convince patients, their physicians, healthcare agencies and payors and the medical community of the benefits of using FW-COV to treat patients with COVID-19 infections with GI symptoms.
With respect to FW-ICI-AC, our oral micronized formulation and niclosamide for ICI-AC, if approved, would compete with both oral and intravenous administered steroids as well as hospital-based infusions of biologics, including infliximab and vedolizumab. We believe our ability to compete in this market, if we are successful in developing and obtaining regulatory approval to market FW- ICI-AC, will depend on our ability (or that of future corporate partners) to convince patients, their physicians, healthcare agencies and payors and the medical community of the benefits of using a non-steroidal, non-biologic therapeutic option for the treatment of ICI-AC.

-12-



With respect to FW-UP and FW-UC, our topical formulation of niclosamide for UP, if approved, would compete with sulfasalazines and 5-ASAs, for the treatment of mild disease, steroids, including budesonide and prednisone, azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, and methotrexate for the treatment of moderate disease, and Anti-TNFs, Entyvio® (vedolizumab), Xeljanz® (Tofacitinib); Stelara® (Ustekinumab) for the treatment of severe disease. We believe our ability to compete in this market, if we are successful in developing and obtaining regulatory approval to market FW-UP and FW-UC, will depend on our ability (or that of future corporate partners) to convince patients, their physicians, healthcare agencies and payors and the medical community of the benefits of using a non-steroidal, non-biologic therapeutic option to prevent the advancement disease requiring more toxic immunosuppressive therapeutic option for the treatment of mild and moderate UP and UC.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. To date, our internal research and development efforts have been conducted in France. We expect to conduct late-stage development work, including clinical trials for niclosamide and adrulipase in both the United States and Europe, as North America is our principal target market for our product candidates that we may successfully develop.
U.S. Government Regulation
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations, and biologics under the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and its implementing regulations. FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. Drugs and biologics are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time during the drug development process, clinical testing, the approval process or after approval, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, placement on Import Alerts, debarment of personnel, employees or officers, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
·completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests, preclinical animal studies, and toxicity data, all performed in accordance with the good laboratory practices, or GLP, regulations;
·submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin;
·approval by an independent IRB or ethics committee representing each clinical site before each clinical study may be initiated;
·performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies to establish the safety and efficacy, or in the case of a biologic, the safety, purity and potency, of the drug candidate for each proposed indication;
·preparation of and submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA, or biologics license application, or BLA, which must include data from required pre-clinical studies and all pivotal clinical studies and information showing that the product can be manufactured in a controlled manner;
·a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA to file the application for review;
·review of the product application by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate and if applicable;
·satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities where the drug candidate is produced to assess compliance with cGMP; and
·FDA review and approval of an NDA or BLA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug or biologic in the United States.

-13-



An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational new drug. An IND must become effective before human clinical studies may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical studies. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before clinical studies can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical studies to commence.
Clinical Studies
Clinical studies involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical studies are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, and the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical study and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical study site’s IRB before the studies may be initiated, and the IRB must monitor the study until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.
The clinical investigation of a drug or biologic is generally divided into three or four phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined.
·Phase 1. The drug or biologic is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational new drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
·Phase 2. The drug or biologic is administered to a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks and preliminarily evaluate efficacy.
·Phase 3. The drug or biologic is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical study sites to generate enough data to statistically evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
·Phase 4. In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA or BLA for a drug candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical studies after approval. In other cases, a sponsor may commit to conducting or voluntarily conduct additional clinical studies after approval to gain more information about the drug. Such post-approval studies are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical studies.
A confirmatory or pivotal study is a clinical study that adequately meets regulatory agency requirements for the evaluation of a drug candidate’s efficacy and safety such that it can be used to justify the approval of the product. Generally, pivotal studies are Phase 3 studies, but the FDA may accept results from Phase 2 studies if the study design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations where there is an unmet medical need and the results are sufficiently robust. In such cases, FDA may require post-market studies for safety and efficacy to be conducted for the drug candidate. The FDA may withdraw the approval if the results indicate that the approved drug is not safe or effective.
The FDA, the IRB or the clinical study sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Additionally, some clinical studies are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical study based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.

-14-



Chemistry, Manufacturing and Control Information
Companies seeking FDA approval of drugs must also develop data and information about the physical characteristics of the components of a product as well as finalize processes for manufacturing the components in commercial quantities in accordance with GMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the components of a product candidate do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life.
Submission of an NDA or BLA to the FDA
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed investigational new drug product information is submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs and BLAs is subject to a substantial application user fee. Applications for orphan drug products are exempted from the NDA and BLA application user fees.
An NDA or BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA.
Once an NDA or BLA has been submitted, the FDA’s goal is to review the application within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.
The FDA is required to refer an application for an investigational drug or biologic to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the investigational product application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions and typically follows such recommendations.

-15-



The FDA’s Decision on an NDA or BLA
After the FDA evaluates the NDA or BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug or biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical study(ies), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical studies, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA could also approve the NDA or BLA with a REMS to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical studies. Such post-market testing may include Phase 4 clinical studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. The FDA may have the authority to withdraw its approval if post-market testing fails to verify the approved drug’s clinical benefit, if the applicant does not perform the required testing with due diligence, or if the any other evidence demonstrates the approved drug is not safe or effective, among other reasons. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
Expedited Review and Accelerated Approval Programs
The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval, regenerative medicine advanced therapy and priority review, that are intended to expedite the development and approval of new drugs and biologics that address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases and conditions. To be eligible for a fast-track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA may review sections of the NDA for a fast-track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current. These six and ten-month review periods are measured from the “filing” date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. Most products that are eligible for fast-track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review.
In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures.

Moreover, under the provisions of the FDA Safety and Innovation Act passed in July 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a drug candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug or biologic that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for the other expedited review and approval programs, including accelerated approval, priority review, regenerative medicine advanced therapy, and fast-track designation. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
In addition, the 21st Century Cures Act in 2016 made the Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy, or RMAT, designation available for investigational drugs that are intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious condition, with preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the drug has the potential for addressing unmet medical needs for such condition. The RMAT designation is available for cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering products, human cell and tissue products, and combination products that use such therapies or products. The advantages of RMAT designation include those of breakthrough and fast track designations, such as early interactions with FDA and rolling review of applications, and the drug candidate with the RMAT designation may be eligible for accelerated approval. Requests for RMAT designations should be made with the IND application (if preliminary clinical evidence is available), but no later than the end-of-phase-2 meeting.
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
Post-Approval Requirements
Drugs and biologics marketed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements.
Manufacturers are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA or BLA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things.
·restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product;
·complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
·fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;

-17-



·refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or BLAs or supplements to approved NDAs or BLAs, or suspension or revocation of product licenses or approvals;
·product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
·injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 individuals in the United States and when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug or biologic in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA or NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular active ingredient for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product marketing exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same use or indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA or NDA application user fee.
A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or, as noted above, if the second applicant demonstrates that its product is clinically superior to the approved product with orphan exclusivity or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Biosimilars and Exclusivity
The Affordable Care Act, signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. To date, only a handful of biosimilars have been licensed under the BPCIA, although numerous biosimilars have been approved in Europe. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars.

-18-



Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, human PK and PD studies, clinical immunogenicity assessments, animal studies and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA.
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical studies to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, recent government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and impact of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.
Hatch-Waxman Amendments and Exclusivity
Section 505 of the FDCA describes three types of marketing applications that may be submitted to the FDA to request marketing authorization for a new drug. A Section 505(b)(1) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy. A 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. This regulatory pathway enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s prior findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. Section 505(j) establishes an abbreviated approval process for a generic version of approved drug products through the submission of an ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a generic drug product that has the same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, performance characteristics and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved product. ANDAs are termed “abbreviated” because they are generally not required to include preclinical (animal) and clinical (human) data to establish safety and efficacy. Instead, generic applicants must scientifically demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent to, or performs in the same manner as, the innovator drug through in vitro, in vivo or other testing. The generic version must deliver the same amount of active ingredients into a subject’s bloodstream in the same amount of time as the innovator drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the reference listed drug. In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s drug or a method of using the drug. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA.

-19-



Upon submission of an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA, an applicant must certify to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except where the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed patent through the last type of certification, also known as a paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all of the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the paragraph IV certification. If the paragraph IV certification is challenged by an NDA holder or the patent owner(s) asserts a patent challenge to the paragraph IV certification, the FDA may not approve that application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the notice of the paragraph IV certification, the expiration of the patent, when the infringement case concerning each such patent was favorably decided in the applicant’s favor or settled, or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. This prohibition is generally referred to as the 30-month stay. In instances where an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant files a paragraph IV certification, the NDA holder or patent owner(s) regularly take action to trigger the 30-month stay, recognizing that the related patent litigation may take many months or years to resolve.
The FDA also cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until all applicable non-patent exclusivities listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug have expired. For example, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may obtain five years of non-patent exclusivity upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity, or NCE, which is a drug containing an active moiety that has not been approved by FDA in any other NDA. An “active moiety” is defined as the molecule responsible for the drug substance’s physiological or pharmacologic action. During that five-year exclusivity period, the FDA cannot accept for filing (and therefore cannot approve) any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug or any 505(b)(2) NDA that relies on the FDA’s approval of the drug, provided that that the FDA may accept an ANDA four years into the NCE exclusivity period if the ANDA applicant also files a Paragraph IV certification.
A drug, including one approved under Section 505(b)(2), may obtain a three-year period of exclusivity for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant. Should this occur, the FDA would be precluded from approving any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for the protected modification until after that three-year exclusivity period has run. However, unlike NCE exclusivity, the FDA can accept an application and begin the review process during the exclusivity period.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations. If their operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, they may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and individual imprisonment.

-20-



Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of any product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products, drugs and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product and also have a material adverse effect on sales. Even after FDA approves a product, failure to have the product covered by third-party payors may have material adverse effect on sales. Federal and state governments continue to promulgate new policies and regulations; such policies and regulations may have material adverse effect on sales. These laws and regulations may restrict, prohibit, or preventing us from implementing a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing, promotion, sales commission, incentive programs, and other business activities. No uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement among third-party payors exists in the United States. Such payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy establishing their coverage and reimbursement policies. However, each payor makes independent and separate decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided.
Legislative and Regulatory Changes, Including Health Care Reform
The laws and regulation that affect our business are subject to change from time to time, and entirely new laws and regulations are sometimes adopted. In particular, healthcare reforms that have been adopted, and that may be adopted in the future, could result in further reductions in coverage and levels of reimbursement for pharmaceutical products, increases in rebates payable under U.S. government rebate programs and additional downward pressure on pharmaceutical product prices. On September 9, 2021, the Biden administration published a wide-ranging list of policy proposals, most of which would need to be carried out by Congress, to reduce drug prices and drug payment. The Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, plan includes, among other reform measures, proposals to lower prescription drug prices, including by allowing Medicare to negotiate prices and disincentivizing price increases, and to support market changes that strengthen supply chains, promote biosimilars and generic drugs, and increase price transparency. Many similar proposals, including the plans to give Medicare Part D authority to negotiate drug prices, require drug manufacturers to pay rebates on drugs whose prices increase greater than the rate of inflation, and cap out-of-pocket costs, have already been included in policy statements and legislation currently being considered by Congress. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, proposing to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. It is unclear to what extent these and other statutory, regulatory, and administrative initiatives will be enacted and implemented.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
Our business activities may be subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations or rules of other countries in which we operate. The FCPA generally prohibits offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a non-U.S. government official in order to influence official action, or otherwise obtain or retain business. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with public officials, including officials of non-U.S. governments. Additionally, in many other countries, the health care providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by their government, and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, our dealings with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. There is no certainty that all of our employees, agents, suppliers, manufacturers, contractors, or collaborators, or those of our affiliates, will comply with all applicable laws and regulations, particularly given the high level of complexity of these laws. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, the closing down of facilities, including those of our suppliers and manufacturers, requirements to obtain export licenses, cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, implementation of compliance programs, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries as well as difficulties in manufacturing or continuing to develop our products, and could materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, and our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.

-21-



European Union Drug Development
In the European Union, our product candidates may also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can only be marketed if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.
Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Clinical trials of medicinal products in the European Union must be conducted in accordance with European Union, national regulations and international standards for good clinical practice, or GCP.
Clinical trials are currently governed by EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC that set out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the European Union.
To improve the current system, Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 on clinical trials on medicinal products for human use was adopted in 2014. The Regulation aims at harmonizing and streamlining the clinical trials authorization process, simplifying adverse event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials, and increasing their transparency, notably via a clinical trial information system set up by the EMA. The new Regulation expressly provides that it will not be applied before six months after the publication of a notice delivered by the European Commission on the European Union clinical trial portal and database. As such notice requires a successful (partial) audit of the database and as that database is still under development, there is no scheduled application date yet. Pursuant to the transitory provisions of the new regulation, the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC will still apply for three years after the implementation of the European Union clinical trial portal and database. Thus, the sponsor has the possibility to choose between the requirements of the directive and the regulation for a period of three years from the entry into force of the regulation.
European Union Drug Review and Approval
In the EEA (which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. MAs may be granted either centrally (Community MA) or nationally (National MA).
The Community MA is issued centrally by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the CHMP of the EMA and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products such as orphan medicinal products and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the European Union.
National MAs are issued nationally by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory. National MAs are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. We do not foresee that any of our current product candidates will be suitable for a National MA as they fall within the mandatory criteria for the Centralized Procedure. Therefore, our product candidates will be approved through Community MAs.
Under the above-described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
The pediatric use marketing authorization, or PUMA, is a dedicated marketing authorization for medicinal products indicated exclusively for use in the pediatric population, with, if necessary, an age-appropriate formulation. Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006 (The “Pediatric Regulation”), all PUMA applications for marketing authorization for new medicines must include to be valid, in addition to the particulars and documents referred to in Directive 2001/83/EC, the results of all studies performed and details of all information collected in compliance with a pediatric investigation plan agreed between regulatory authorities and the applicant, unless the medicine is exempt because of a deferral or waiver of the EMA.

-22-



Before the EMA is able to begin its assessment of a Community MA application, it will validate that the applicant has complied with the agreed pediatric investigation plan. The applicant and the EMA may, where such a step is adequately justified, agree to modify a pediatric investigation plan to assist validation. Modifications are not always possible; may take longer to agree than the period of validation permits; and may still require the applicant to withdraw its marketing authorization application and to conduct additional non-clinical and clinical studies. Products that are granted a MA on the basis of the pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, are eligible for a six-month extension of the protection under a supplementary protection certificate (if any is in effect at the time of approval) or, in the case of orphan medicinal products, a two-year extension of the orphan market exclusivity. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted.
Orphan Drugs
In the European Union, Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of December 16, 1999 on orphan medicinal products, as amended, states that a drug shall be designated as an orphan drug if its sponsor can establish that the three following cumulative conditions are met:
·the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition;
·the prevalence of the conditions is not more than five in ten thousand persons in the European Union when the application is made, or that it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Union and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the European Union would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment; and
·that there is no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the European Union or, if such method exists, that the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.
Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 of April 27, 2000 laying down the provisions for implementation of the criteria for designation of a medicinal product as an orphan medicinal product and definitions of the concepts “similar medicinal product” and “clinical superiority”, an application for the designation of a drug as an orphan drug must be submitted at any stage of development of the drug before filing of a MA application.
The European Union offers incentives to encourage the development of designated orphan medicines (protocol assistance, fee reductions, etc.) and provides opportunities for market exclusivity. Pursuant to abovementioned Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000, products receiving orphan designation in the European Union can obtain market exclusivity for a certain number of years in the European Union following the marketing approval.
If a Community MA in respect of an orphan drug is granted, regulatory authorities will not, for a period of usually ten years, accept another application for a MA, or grant a MA or accept an application to extend an existing MA, for the same therapeutic indication, in respect of a similar drug. This period may however be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established, in respect of the drug concerned, that the above-mentioned criteria for orphan drug designation are no longer met, in other words, when it is shown on the basis of available evidence that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
Pursuant to Regulation No. 1901/2006, for orphan medicinal products, instead of an extension of the supplementary protection certificate, the ten-year period of orphan market exclusivity should be extended to 12 years if the requirement for data on use in the pediatric population is fully met (i.e. when the request contains the results of all studies carried out under the approved PIP and when the declaration attesting the conformity of the request to this PIP is included in the MA).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a MA may be granted, for the same therapeutic indication, to a similar drug if:
·the holder of the MA for the original orphan drug has given its consent to the second applicant;
·the holder of the MA for the original orphan drug is unable to supply sufficient quantities of the drug; or
​

-23-



·the second applicant can establish in the application that the second drug, although similar to the orphan drug already authorized, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior.
The abovementioned Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 provides for other incentives regarding orphan medicinal products.
Post-Approval Controls
The holder of a MA must comply with EU requirements applicable to manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products. In particular, the holder of the MA must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance, or QPPV, who is responsible for oversight of that system and who will reside and operate in the EU. Key obligations include safety expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports, or PSURs.
All new MAs must include a risk management plan, or RMP, to submit to the EMA, describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the MA. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies. RMPs and PSURs are routinely available to third parties requesting access, subject to limited redactions. All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary of product characteristics, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the European Union. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under EU directives, the details are governed by regulations in each EU Member State and can differ from one country to another.
Reimbursement
The European Union provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A Member State may approve a specific price for the medicinal product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. For example, in France, effective market access will be supported by agreements with hospitals and products may be reimbursed by the Social Security Fund. The price of medicines covered by national health insurance is negotiated with the Economic Committee for Health Products, or CEPS. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our product candidates. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
Other European Regulatory Matters
French Regulatory Framework for Clinical Development
In France, Directive No. 2001/20/EC has been implemented in French national law, establishing a system of prior authorization and requiring a prior favorable opinion from an ethics committee.
Parties to a clinical trial agreement, or CTA, must use a CTA template (“unique agreement” or “convention unique”) to organize the conduct of interventional clinical trials with commercial purpose, as well as specific template exhibits to this agreement. Once concluded, the CTA is communicated for information by the sponsor to the French national board of physicians (Ordre national des médecins) without delay.
The processing of personal data collected during clinical trials has to comply with the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 and Law No 2018-493 of June 20, 2018 on the protection of personal data, implementing the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 requirements. Regarding automatic processing operations for the purpose of research or clinical studies, formalities have to be completed before the French data protection authority, the Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés, or CNIL, so as to obtain the authorization to process personal data. However, there are simplified standards.

-24-



Law No. 2011-2012 of December 29, 2011, or Loi Bertrand, aimed at strengthening the health safety of medicinal and health products, as amended (and its implementing decrees), introduced into French law provisions regarding transparency of fees received by some healthcare professionals from health product industries, i.e. companies manufacturing or marketing health products (Article L.1453-1 of the French Public Health Code). These provisions have been recently extended and redefined by Decree No. 2016-1939 of December 28, 2016, which clarified French “Sunshine” regulations. The decree notably provides that companies manufacturing or marketing health care products (medicinal products, medical devices, etc.) in France shall publicly disclose (mainly on a specific public website available at: https://www.entreprises-transparence.sante.gouv.fr) the advantages and fees paid to healthcare professionals amounting to €10 or above, as well as the agreements concluded with the latter, along with detailed information about each agreement (the precise subject matter of the agreement, the date of signature of the agreement, its end date, the total amount paid to the healthcare professional, etc.). Another declaration must also be filed to the competent healthcare professional body. Law No. 2011-2012 also reinforced the French anti-gift rules and Order No. 2017-49 of January 19, 2017 amended the law and expanded the scope of the general prohibition of payments from pharmaceutical and device manufacturers to healthcare professionals to broadly cover any company manufacturing or marketing health products, regardless of whether or not payment for the products is reimbursed under the French social security system (new Articles L. 1453-3 et seq. of the French Public Health Code). It also changed the procedure related to the prior submission to the national or departmental board of the relevant healthcare professional body. Moreover, the penalties incurred for non-compliance with the requirements of the Anti-Gift Law will be doubled to a fine of up to €750,000.
