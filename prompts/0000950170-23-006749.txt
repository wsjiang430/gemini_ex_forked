 Item 1: Business
 Our Company
 We are an enterprise real estate technology company that provides a comprehensive management platform designed for property owners, managers and residents. Our suite of products and services, which includes both smart building hardware and cloud-based software-as-a-service ("SaaS") solutions, provides seamless visibility and control over real estate assets. Our platform lowers operating costs, increases revenues, mitigates operational friction and protects assets for owners and operators, while providing a differentiated, elevated living experience for residents.
Through a central connected device ("Hub Device"), we integrate our proprietary enterprise software with third-party smart devices and other technology interfaces. We use an open-architecture, brand-agnostic approach that allows owners, operators, and residents to manage their smart home systems through a single connected interface. Our solutions include smart apartments and homes, access control for buildings, common areas, and rental units, asset protection and monitoring, parking management, self-guided tours, and community and resident Wi-Fi. We also have a professional services team that provides customers with training, installation, and support services.
 We have designed our smart home operating platform to make the residential real estate industry more efficient and effective. Importantly, our enterprise software integrates into most existing property management systems used by residential property owners and operators. We believe that our customers realize several benefits from implementing our solutions, including:
 Operating Efficiency. We estimate that our customers can recognize cost savings on utilities through the utilization of our solutions, including our connected smart thermostats, smart lights, and leak sensors, as well as through more efficient management of vacant rental units.
  Incremental Revenue Generation. We estimate that multifamily rental owners may be able to increase rental rates (depending on the rental market and solutions offered) due to the differentiated resident experience and strong demand for smart communities. Additionally, we believe our solutions can increase resident retention, accelerate leasing and re-leasing activities, and provide ancillary monetization opportunities.
  Cost Reduction. We estimate that owners and operators can decrease their leasing and re-leasing costs by streamlining the processes associated with touring, resident onboarding and offboarding, and customer servicing. For example, our self-guided-tour solution allows prospective residents to tour a property 24 hours a day, seven days a week, without assistance from property management staff. In addition, we expect our solutions will help to eliminate or reduce rekeying and lockout expenses and other property management redundancies.
  Asset Protection. We estimate that customers utilizing our asset protection solutions, including our connected leak sensors and thermostats, may be able to realize a decrease of approximately 70% to 90% in water damage expenses and lower insurance costs.
 We believe SmartRent is the category leader in the enterprise smart home solutions industry. We define Units Deployed as the aggregate number of Hub Devices that have been installed (including customer self-installations) as of a stated measurement date. We define Committed Units as the aggregate number of Hub Device (i) units that are subject to binding orders from customers together with (ii) units that existing customers who are parties to a SmartRent master services agreement have informed us (on a non-binding basis) that they intend to order in the future for deployment within two years of the measurement date. As of December 31, 2022, we had 547,196 Units Deployed, 851,815 Committed Units, and 501 customers, including many of the top multifamily residential owners in the United States (the "U.S."). Our customers own or operate an aggregate of approximately 6.7 million units. This represents approximately 15% of the U.S. market for institutionally owned multifamily rental units and single-family rental homes. In addition to multifamily residential owners, our customers include some of the leading homebuilders, single-family rental homeowners, and iBuyers in the U.S.
 Our Industry, Competition and Market Opportunity
 Increasing Demand for Smart Home Technology
We believe that network effects are driving demand for smart home technology and increasing the penetration of smart home technology in both the multifamily residential and single-family rental home sectors. Many residents now view smart home technology as a necessity, although relatively few communities currently offer it to residents. Entrata, a developer of property management software, estimates that more than 75% of residents would pay more for an apartment equipped with smart home technology, and Schlage, a smart lock provider, estimates millennials would be willing to pay 20% more on average per month for rental units equipped with smart home technology. We expect this dynamic will drive demand for smart home technology as additional owners and operators evolve to meet this growing demand for integrated smart home solutions.
Fragmented Technology Offerings
While demand for smart home technology has increased, the residential technology market remains fragmented, with offerings generally consisting of isolated point solutions and closed-architecture devices that do not integrate with one another. To assemble a complete building solution, owners and operators often need to source smart home technology from multiple vendors and point solution providers and patch their products together to create a modern building experience. Under this fragmented structure, the process to evaluate, procure, install, and service smart home technology can be expensive and time-consuming for owners and operators. With our holistic smart home operating system and in-house installation, training, and support services, we believe we offer a smart home solution that provides a full-service, end-to-end experience.
Competitive Market
 Given the emerging nature of smart home technology in residential real estate, the industry is highly fragmented and there are a number of companies developing solutions that may be similar to parts of our smart home operating system. We believe our primary competitors are other software companies, which have historically provided singular, point solutions to new development properties and used third-party installation services, and hardware companies, many of which have closed architectures. We believe these companies fail to provide a comprehensive solution that meets the enterprise management and security requirements of owners, operators, and residents. We expect competition to intensify in the future as the market for smart home technology in the residential real estate industry continues to mature.
Our Competitive Strengths
 
We believe we have developed the most scalable and operator-friendly smart home operating system in the industry based on our platform’s unique combination of attributes:
 Integrated Solution. We offer a holistic integrated solution that includes enterprise software, hardware, and resident applications.
  Hardware Agnostic. Our solutions are compatible with a wide variety of other smart devices including, among others, Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Honeywell thermostats, and Yale smart locks.
  Open Architecture. We have an open architecture that can integrate with many property management systems, including, among others, Yardi, Entrata, RealPage, and Engrain.
  Professional Services. We provide in-house professional services with employees in our implementation, installation, support, and warehouse departments, which allows us to maintain consistent quality and service across markets.
 While several of the top multifamily residential owners are current SmartRent customers, we believe that we have only begun to take advantage of the full market opportunity in residential and commercial real estate sectors and in domestic and international markets. For example, we have adapted our software and applications to target opportunities in other residential real estate sectors, including single-family rental homes, student housing, senior housing, and new construction homes. In addition, we believe there is significant potential for growth beyond residential real estate to other commercial real estate asset classes, including, among others, office, hotels, retail, industrial, and self-storage. Furthermore, we believe there is an attractive opportunity to expand our smart home solutions into other markets globally.
 
SaaS Model
We enter into binding, recurring revenue contracts with customers typically ranging from one month to ten years; our average recurring revenue contract term is 2.6 years. In 2022, approximately 38% of our customers prepaid their software contracts. We believe that our customer base is inherently sticky given the barriers to entry associated with rolling out an integrated enterprise solution across a portfolio of rental units.
Seasonality
 Our business and related operating results have been, and we believe that they will continue to be, impacted by seasonal factors throughout the year. We typically experience greater demand for deployments in the Spring and Summer, and lower demand in late Fall and Winter.
 
SmartRent Solutions and Products
 A SmartRent connected community is a “curb to couch” concept where an entire property utilizes a variety of proprietary and third-party smart devices and features that can be remotely managed to provide efficiency, automation, asset protection, and ancillary revenue opportunities.

SmartRent Solutions
Our fully integrated, hardware-agnostic solutions include the following:
 SmartRent Manager. SmartRent Manager is a proprietary, web-based software that owners and operators use to administer and configure community settings related to SmartRent solutions. SmartRent Manager software integrates with many popular property management, customer relationship management, and other third-party software products, which enables owners and operators to manage all resident, prospect, access, and other actionable data from one platform. When a resident moves out, the automated move-out feature immediately locks the apartment door, resets interior thermostats to the “Vacant Mode” temperature, and revokes resident access to their unit, common areas, and the SmartRent app — all with the click of a button. Communities can create “Vacant Mode” automations to increase efficiencies, such as work orders for unit turns and activating energy-saving mode. SmartRent Manager Mobile, a native mobile application, allows owners and operators to remotely manage work orders and control access, including resident move-ins and outs.
Access Control. Access Control is a community-wide, cloud-based access control system that protects building entry, common areas, and amenity spaces for multifamily residential properties through the use of control panels, smart access locks, and intercoms. Deeply integrated with major property management systems and SmartRent’s extensive product suite, Access Control automates labor-intensive manual processes to enhance operational efficiencies of common area access and community security. This solution allows residents to create temporary access codes for deliveries, services, or guest access while also offering remote access for residents and site teams at various entry points (e.g., amenity doors, gates, pools, and elevators) without the need for fobs or separate keys. The system features monitoring systems for visitor logs and real-time door lock activity alerts. Access Control can be implemented in new construction or retrofitted in existing properties.
 Asset Protection. Asset Protection solutions help ensure the longevity of communities by reducing the risk of damage through high-precision leak sensors and smart thermostats. Community Manager software and integrated flood, temperature, and humidity sensors can be configured to notify owners and operators at the first sign of an issue, automatically generate a work order into the property management system, and dispatch a technician to solve the issue, allowing management to act quickly and avoid damages and costly repairs. Flood sensors can be placed under or near any appliance that may be susceptible to water damage, such as sump pumps, toilets, washing machines, dishwashers, water heaters, and sinks. Asset Protection solutions provide owners and operators the ability to detect abnormal humidity levels and extreme temperature changes, which help protect floors from warping and prevent mold from forming.
Self-Guided Tours. Self-Guided Tours is a white-labeled, stand-alone solution that allows prospective renters and buyers to search available rental units, homes, or model inventory, and tour at a time most convenient for them without the need for site teams or management to be present. With no app download required, prospects can search for their next home through a web-based platform, which is accessible through a web browser on a mobile device or computer. Self-Guided Tours include various features to ensure each self-guided tour is safe, productive, and convenient, including ID Verification for each prospective renter/buyer and an Interactive Site Map to help prospects navigate to tourable homes. The technology enables owners and operators to expand showing hours outside of traditional hours, permit showings promptly upon request through our “Tour Now” functionality, and conduct multiple tours at the same time without hiring additional staff. Self-Guided Tours integrates with many popular property management and customer relationship management systems, and other third-party software products, which enables owners and operators to manage all prospect and other actionable data from one platform.
Community WiFi. Community WiFi provides communities with a private, device-dedicated WiFi network to power Hub Devices and other in-home smart devices. While Hub Devices have built-in cellular connectivity, in markets where cell coverage is not available or poor, communities can add Community WiFi to help maintain a consistent connection. With a Community WiFi system, owners, operators, and residents will have access to a dedicated and secure network, as well as a private connection that provides a stronger and more reliable signal for Hub Devices and other devices. We are able to install our Community WiFi system in any property type, including new construction or retrofitting existing structures, and perform site surveys to customize the equipment best suited to each property.
Resident App. Resident App is designed to put comfort, control, and convenience in residents’ hands by giving them the ability to control their smart devices via a mobile application. With just a tap, residents can lock and unlock their front door, adjust the thermostat to their liking, and automate daily tasks through Schedules and Automations. Residents can also create service requests within the app, which automatically generates a work order within the client’s integrated property management system, allowing maintenance to fix the issue quickly. Residents can control who enters their home by creating and sharing access codes with visitors. Powered by the Resident App, the best-in-class smart home experience streamlines daily interactions with staff and delivers the modern living experience residents expect.


Parking Management. Parking Management is a smart parking system designed to alleviate the resident and guest parking issues faced by multifamily residential properties. This solution provides an integrated software system and single-source database that allows owners and operators to assign and re-assign parking spaces, review interactive maps for live parking space availability (based on parking sensors for real-time occupancy), implement a proactive enforcement process, monitor parking management with resident parking decals, and install custom parking signs to monetize guest parking. Through a Parking Management portal, residents can add or remove vehicles, edit vehicle details, review assigned parking decals, and provide guests with parking access. Parking Management integrates with many popular property management systems, which enables owners and operators to manage all parking-related actions from one platform. Parking Management is available to communities as a stand-alone product or as part of our fully integrated smart home operating system.
Work Management. Work Management is a solution that enables on-site teams to manage tasks, respond quickly to inquiries, and engage in preventative maintenance all from a mobile device. Through work order and service request automations, the platform provides a simplified overview of on-site tasks and allows for easy scheduling of team members. In addition, the application offers a mobile interface, allowing owners and operators to accomplish more on the go with access to the application available both online and offline. Work Management provides real-time tracking of assets, enabling owners to effectively manage the state of their assets and make informed decisions by giving on-site teams an easy way to scan assets and make updates from anywhere in the community. Advanced reporting capabilities allow for filtering and easy exporting of data into third-party tools for deeper analysis. The application integrates seamlessly with major property management systems to provide an up-to-date and personalized experience.
 Answer Automation. Answer Automation is a personalized call automation platform that reduces costs and improves on-site team efficiency through the automation of leasing and resident call handling. The platform automatically routes calls to the right team members with up to ten levels of escalation based on a predetermined set of business rules. Answer Automation’s integrations with major property management systems enable our platform to immediately recognize resident calls via Caller ID so site teams can deliver a personalized experience. In addition, Call Masking, which masks the team member’s phone number so that it appears to the call recipient as the community’s phone number, allows team members to easily communicate with residents and prospective residents without exposing their personal information. Advanced reporting capabilities help site teams make informed decisions and bring attention to the most frequent call areas.
Audit Management. Audit Management allows for the quick and reliable determination of a community’s financial accuracy through a consolidated review of the rent roll, deposits, resident lease files, and more. The platform captures community demographics to minimize risks and evaluate whether residents can meet pro forma rents and satisfy lender requirements by comparing the current rent roll to resident lease files. Users can build and edit templates on the fly to include custom forms and fields, streamlining the audit process and increasing efficiency for teams. Real-time variance tracking and reporting helps teams easily identify and correct common data entry errors, as well as analyze and share results. With an intuitive design and customization options, Audit Management replaces outdated, manual processes with a modern, user-friendly platform.
 
Inspection Management. Inspection Management automates the property inspection process so that teams can quickly access property and unit conditions, plan for capital improvement expenses, and monitor the performance of a portfolio. The mobile platform is available on iOS and Android and is accessible both online and offline. Inspection Management streamlines inspections with customizable fields and forms and simplifies documentation with team coordination, allowing for easy scheduling and assigning of tasks to team members, vendors, and contractors. The application enables teams to build accurate budgets with real-time cost-tracking capabilities based on pre-established standard costs. Insightful reporting provides data using customized filters, allowing teams to easily analyze, export, and share findings to make informed decisions.
 
SmartRent Hardware
We offer a variety of in-rental unit devices that elevate the resident experience and provide multiple benefits to owners and operators. A typical SmartRent rental unit or single-family rental home is equipped with a Hub Device, smart locks, thermostat, and leak sensors. In addition, several other devices can be integrated into our smart home operating system, including smart plugs and lighting (including light bulbs, switches, and dimmers), shades, garage door controllers, video doorbells, peephole cameras, video intercoms, contact and motion sensors, and voice assistants. With our smart home operating system, residents can remotely control and manage their smart home devices and home settings through a single application. In addition, because our software is hardware agnostic, customers can choose from a wide variety of device manufacturers and use their favorite devices together in one fully integrated smart home operating system.
The Hub Devices are a vital aspect of our smart home operating system that elevates the living experience for residents. Our Hub Devices use reliable and secure Z-Wave communication for remote control of connected devices and allow users to remotely manage multiple device settings from one application. Certain Hub Devices combine a thermostat and touchscreen panel that allows users to control all of their devices from one location. Using the touchscreen device, users can, among other things, review settings, change the temperature, and lock or unlock doors. In addition, users can download the companion mobile application to remotely control their devices, such as manage their home temperature and grant access for guests and deliveries.

We also partner with several manufacturers to offer a range of compatible hardware options for any property, including:
 Video Doorbells. We partner with Ring to offer a selection of compatible video-enabled doorbells. Our integration with Ring allows users to add devices to their SmartRent application for a more robust control system, including live view and notifications.
  Indoor and Outdoor Cameras. We also partner with Ring to offer a selection of indoor and outdoor cameras that can be added to any property. With battery-operated and plug-in options available, customers have flexibility to select the cameras that are appropriate for each property.
  Smart Locks and Lock Boxes. Our selection of Z-Wave or Bluetooth-enabled smart locks and lock boxes offer customers options for keyless entry and simplified guest access. With various keyless entry options, including deadbolts, interconnected locks, lever locks, and patio locks, these products can be customized to meet each property’s needs.
  Smart Thermostats, Sensors, Plugs, Switches, Dimmers, and Readers. We offer (i) thermostats for all types of HVAC systems with programmable options, including forced air, radiant and heat pump, (ii) leak, parking, contact and motion sensors used to proactively monitor and protect properties, (iii) smart plugs to add automation to lights, fans, or other small appliances, (iv) smart switches and dimmers to upgrade lighting in apartments and homes, and (v) a selection of readers, panels, and boards, including as part of our Alloy Access solution.
 Environmental and Sustainability Benefits
 We are facilitating a more sustainable future by helping owners, operators, and residents reduce energy consumption, meet de-carbonization goals and achieve sustainability objectives. Our solutions are designed to reduce overall energy consumption by setting limitations on vacant units, controlling ventilation, and providing automated work orders based on temperature and humidity thresholds. We estimate that our solutions could reduce total U.S. energy consumption by up to 4%, if all rental units in the U.S. were fully equipped with our solutions. Our platform drives these benefits through a variety of connected devices, including smart thermostats, leak sensors, smart appliances and smart lighting. We also reduce waste through predictive maintenance tools and building software integrations. In this way, our solutions are a key tool in reducing water usage and energy consumption across entire portfolios of real estate assets.
Human Capital Management
 Our employees are critical to our success. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 701 total employees worldwide, all of which are full-time employees. We also engage consultants and contractors to supplement our permanent workforce. A majority of our employees are engaged in engineering, software and product development, sales, and related functions. As of December 31, 2022, we have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relationship with our employees to be in good standing. None of our domestic or international employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a labor union.
We seek to foster a welcoming, inclusive work environment where employees can be themselves and do meaningful work that positively impacts our customers and communities. Our culture is supportive, engaging, and fast paced and facilitates partnerships among coworkers with diverse backgrounds and experiences. Our employees have opportunities to get involved in resource groups (e.g., Women’s Empowerment and PRISM) and give back to the community. We engage with our employees to gather insight, feedback, and data about their workplace experiences, and manager effectiveness. This data informs and supports our action plans, with the goal of enhancing workplace satisfaction and overall employee well-being and effectiveness.
We attract and retain talent through our employer brand initiatives, employee referral programs, and partnerships with outside agencies that focus on presenting diverse candidates and through internal career growth. Employee growth and development comes from receiving real-time, informal feedback, a formal performance review, career path transparency, and ongoing role-specific training.
The structure of our compensation programs endeavors to give employees peace of mind when it comes to health and financial benefits so that they can focus on doing their best work. Our total rewards program enables us to retain talent, reward high-performing employees at all levels and incentivize and motivate exceptional performance. In addition to competitive base pay, we have an annual bonus program for employees at all levels and a comprehensive variable compensation program specific to our revenue organization. Both the bonus and variable compensation plans are tied directly to individual and company performance. We also provide 100% employer paid medical, dental, and vision for employees and their dependents, life insurance, flexible time off, paid parental leave, and a 401(k) plan with a company match.
Research and Development
 Our near-term product roadmap includes new leasing solutions (including an online application for the leasing process and other applications for lease signing and customer relationship management), resident experience solutions (including applications for marketplaces, amenity reservations, rent payments, and work orders), home IoT solutions (including hubless systems, smart appliances, and video and security systems), and building IoT solutions (including energy, water, and air metering). We also engage in ongoing activities in connection with enhancement of existing products, integration with new third-party products and services, and the development of internal applications to improve efficiency of our operations.
Supply Chain
 
Generally, our hardware device suppliers maintain a stock of devices and key components to cover any minor supply chain disruptions. Where possible we utilize multiple sourcing methods to mitigate the risk of disruption from a single supplier. However, we also rely on a number of single source and limited source suppliers for components of our solution. Replacing any single source or limited source suppliers could require the expenditure of significant resources and time to source these products. In order to mitigate the potential impact of supply chain disruptions, we have engaged in carrying increased quantities of inventory in our warehouse and invested in building a more robust team of supply chain personnel to manage the procurement, warehousing and distribution of inventory.
Intellectual Property
 
We regard our intellectual property rights as critical to our success generally, with our trademarks, service marks, and domain names being especially critical to the continued development and awareness of our brands and marketing efforts. We protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademarks, trade dress, domain name registrations, and trade secrets, as well as through contractual restrictions and reliance on federal, state, and common law. We enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with employees, consultants, contractors, and business partners, which include invention assignment provisions for our employees and contractors. We have several registered trademarks in the U.S., as well as other trademarks globally. We have also registered a variety of domestic and international domain names, the most significant of which relate to our SmartRent brand.
Government Regulation
 
We and our partners are subject to various federal, state, and local regulations related to access control products, such as state and local building and fire codes, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended, and requirements for certifications by Underwriters Laboratories, a global independent safety science company, and the Federal Communications Commission.

We, our customers, and our partners may be subject to numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, data privacy and security laws, and consumer protection laws and regulations (including Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914 (the "FTC Act") that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of personal information). Privacy and security laws, self-regulatory schemes, regulations, standards, and other obligations are constantly evolving, and may conflict with each other, which complicates compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing. For example, California has enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the "CCPA") that became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA creates, among other things, new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provides new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to access and delete personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how personal information is used. The CCPA also creates a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act (the "CPRA"), which was recently voted into law by California residents, imposes additional data protection obligations on covered companies doing business in California, including additional consumer rights processes and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. The CPRA also creates a new California data protection agency specifically tasked to enforce the law, which would likely result in increased regulatory scrutiny of California businesses in the areas of data protection and security. The substantive requirements for businesses subject to the CPRA went into effect on January 1, 2023 and become enforceable on July 1, 2023. Further, according to the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"), violating consumers’ privacy rights or failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure may constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act. The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Other regulations that may apply to us, for example, depending upon the circumstances, include the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union, Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), and the Tenant Data Privacy Act (TPDA) in New York.
