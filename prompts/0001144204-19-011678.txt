ITEM 1. BUSINESS
SUMMARY
 
We are a leading health and wellness company that empowers people to transform their lives one healthy habit at a time. Through our rapidly growing community of independent wellness coaches, we seek to enrich the lives of our clients through programs that promote healthy living and through the manufacture and distribution of clinically proven, proprietary products. We believe we are building the most trusted, transparent and effective direct-sales health and wellness community in the world. Our operations are primarily conducted through our wholly owned subsidiaries, Jason Pharmaceuticals, Inc., OPTAVIA, LLC, Jason Enterprises, Inc., Jason Properties, LLC, Medifast Franchise Systems, Inc., Medifast Nutrition, Inc., Seven Crondall Associates, LLC, Corporate Events, Inc., OPTAVIA (Hong Kong) Limited and OPTAVIA (Singapore) PTE. LTD.
 
Since our founding, we have been an innovator in the development of nutritional weight-management products and programs. We sell a variety of weight loss, weight management and healthy living products all based on our proprietary formulas under the Medifast®, OPTAVIA®, Thrive by Medifast, Optimal Health by OPTAVIA, Flavors of Home®, and Essential 1 brands. Our meal replacement line includes more than 150 options, including, but not limited to, bars, bites, pretzels, puffs, cereal crunch, drinks, hearty choices, oatmeal, pancakes, pudding, soft serve, shakes, smoothies, soft bakes, and soups. The Thrive by Medifast and Optimal Health by OPTAVIA lines include a variety of specially formulated bars, shakes, and smoothies for those who are maintaining their weight for long-term healthy living. We identify opportunities to expand our product line by regularly surveying our clients and studying industry and consumer trends. This allows us to introduce new, high quality products that meet consumer demand.
 
Our nutritional products are formulated with high-quality, low-calorie, and low-fat ingredients. Products include individually portioned, calorie- and carbohydrate-controlled meal replacements that share a similar nutritional footprint and provide a balance of protein and good carbohydrates. Our meal replacements are also fortified to contain vitamins and minerals, as well as other nutrients essential for good health.
 
In March 2018, we announced a change in how our business is managed, operating performance is reviewed and resources are allocated. As a result, beginning in the first quarter of 2018, we changed how we report financial performance to align with changes in the way we now manage the business and now operate and report as a single sales segment, OPTAVIA. We previously disclosed entity-wide financial information for multiple segments (e.g. OPTAVIA, Medifast Direct, Franchise Medifast Weight Control Centers and Medifast Wholesale). Although we have one reportable segment we continue to market our products and programs through our Medifast Direct ecommerce platform and our Franchise Medifast Weight Control Center channels.
 
OPTAVIA encompasses our community of OPTAVIA Coaches, our OPTAVIA health and wellness programs, and our proprietary OPTAVIA-branded products. The OPTAVIA Integrated Coaching Model is centered around providing focused, individualized attention to our clients. Our OPTAVIA Coaches provide the support and encouragement for clients to successfully learn and adopt a more healthy lifestyle. This clinically-proven model translates into better client results when compared to programs that leave individuals to adopt and maintain healthy habits on their own. Our clients receive personalized attention from our OPTAVIA Coaches who share, educate, motivate and pass along their passion for healthy living. We believe this personal, direct-sales and service strategy is optimal for activating and supporting our clients. A recent clinical study published in Obesity Science and Practice demonstrated that the OPTAVIA program with its strong coach-client relationships is more effective than a self-directed weight loss program.
 
Our OPTAVIA Coaches are independent contractors, not employees, who support our clients and market our products and services primarily through word of mouth, email, direct mail and via social media channels such as Facebook, Twitter or Zoom. As direct-sales entrepreneurs, OPTAVIA Coaches market our products to friends, family and other acquaintances with whom they have established strong relationships.
 
The entrepreneurial success of our OPTAVIA Coaches is the key to our success. We are focused on scaling our OPTAVIA Integrated Coaching Model by offering economic incentives that are attractive to independent entrepreneurs and reflective of the new “gig economy”. Our successful clients frequently become enthusiastic health and wellness advocates themselves and choose to become OPTAVIA Coaches. This process of clients becoming OPTAVIA Coaches underpins our growth.
 
We offer our OPTAVIA clients exclusive OPTAVIA-branded nutritional products, or “Fuelings” and also offer a variety of other weight loss, weight management, and healthy living products under other brands. OPTAVIA Fuelings come in a variety of flavors that appeal to a broad variety of tastes. Our products are nutrient-dense, portion controlled, nutritionally interchangeable and simple to use. They are formulated with high-quality, low-calorie, and low-fat ingredients. Products include individually portioned, calorie- and carbohydrate-controlled meal replacements that share a similar nutritional footprint and provide a balance of protein and good carbohydrates. Our meal replacements are also fortified to contain vitamins and minerals, as well as other nutrients essential for good health. We manufacture the majority of our powder-based products at our manufacturing facility located in Owings Mills, Maryland and subcontract the production of all other products. Of all OPTAVIA product sales, 90% are shipped directly to our clients who are working with an OPTAVIA Coach. OPTAVIA Coaches do not handle or deliver merchandise to clients. This arrangement frees our OPTAVIA Coaches from having to manage inventory and allows them to maintain an arms-length transactional relationship while focusing their attention on support and encouragement.
 
Our success in creating the OPTAVIA community, and achieving the desired results for our clients, is reflected in the growing number of active earning OPTAVIA Coaches. The total number of active earning OPTAVIA Coaches as of December 31, 2018 was 24,100. OPTAVIA’s success is further exemplified in our strong financial performance over the last several years. As a result of our strategic investment in the introduction, marketing and development of our OPTAVIA brand, our OPTAVIA business now accounts for 92.9% of our revenues. Our revenues have been growing at a rapid pace. We generated revenue of $501.0 million in 2018, $301.6 million in 2017, and $274.5 million in 2016, representing year-over-year increases of 66.1% in 2018, and 9.8% in 2017. In 2018 income from operations was $69.0 million, $39.6 million in 2017, and $26.9 million in 2016, increases of 74.3% in 2018, and 47.6% in 2017. (See “Selected Consolidated Financial Data.”)

Transparency is a core principal for our direct-sales business. We adhere to the direct-selling industry’s highest ethical standards and best practices. We are a member in good standing of the Direct Selling Association (“DSA”), a well-known and widely respected national trade association representing more than 200 direct selling companies in the United States. As a member of the DSA, we underwent a comprehensive and rigorous review that included a detailed analysis of our direct-sales business model and practices.
 
Our continued investment, development and successes creating a robust community around our OPTAVIA brand and our OPTAVIA Integrated Coaching Model, we believe, demonstrates a sustainable, repeatable business rhythm focused on our long-term goal and mission of Offering the World Lifelong Transformation, One Healthy Habit at a Time.
 
MARKETS
 
Health & Wellness Consumers
 
We develop and market health and wellness products for consumers who want to lose weight and adopt a holistic approach to overall health and wellness. Our target demographic is women ages 30-50 who wish to lose 20-30 pounds and who have tried and failed to achieve and maintain their healthy weight previously. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”), 71.6% of all adults in the United States aged 20 and above are overweight or obese. We believe we offer these consumers a radically different approach to health, with weight loss and weight management serving as a catalyst to an overall improvement in health, confidence, vitality and general well-being.
Consumer Motivation
 
Our core clients are highly motivated to adopt a healthy lifestyle that is transformative and sustainable. Many have tried weight loss programs previously, but have been unsuccessful maintaining a healthy weight and embracing healthy habits for the long-term. Lifestyle issues our clients often are seeking to address and resolve include:

· | physical limitations and debilitating medical conditions linked to an unhealthy weight;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the desire for more energy to meet physical demands and aspirations (e.g. work, parenting, sports and recreation);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | mental, emotional and psychological limitations caused by being at an unhealthy weight;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | triggers that cause chronic “emotional eating” or “comfort eating”;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


· | lack of knowledge or understanding about the impact of certain foods on their bodies and overall health;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Lack of knowledge or understanding about how to balance different food groups;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the need for a convenient and simple, healthy lifestyle solution or program to accommodate demands on their time; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the need for a community of like-minded people for support to achieve their goals.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Weight management is a challenge for a significant portion of the U.S. population, as well as the global population. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, overweight and obese individuals are increasingly at risk for diseases such as Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, certain types of cancer, stroke, arthritis, sleep apnea and depression. In 2013, The American Medical Association declared obesity a disease and the American Heart Association, the American College of Cardiology, and the Obesity Society jointly issued treatment guidelines recommending obesity be managed as a chronic disease. The World Health Organization estimates that approximately 1.9 billion people 46 years and older are overweight worldwide, triple the rate since 1975. In the United States, more than two-thirds of the adult population fall within the overweight or obese categories and approximately 37% (over 78 million) are obese.
 
Obesity is defined as a Body Mass Index (“BMI”) of 30 kg/m2 or greater, whereas overweight is defined as a BMI ranging between 25 and 29.9 kg/m. In 2016, the United States had an obesity rate of at least 20%. Only four states had an obesity rate that was less than 25%; twenty-five states had an adult obesity rate of 30% or higher. Being overweight and/or obese is linked to a multitude of serious comorbidities including heart disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes, certain types of cancers, arthritis, sleep apnea and depression. In fact, the 2016 State of Obesity Report by Trust for America’s Health and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation estimated 80% of people with diabetes are overweight or obese.
 
The primary factors contributing to obesity, are well-known: unhealthy food choices, excessive caloric intake, and lack of physical activity. Obesity is not limited to adults, children and adolescents are also affected. According to the CDC, in the past 30 years the prevalence of obesity in children age 6-11 years has doubled and obesity rates have quadrupled in adolescents age 12-19 years. Approximately 18% of children and 21% of adolescents are obese and are at an increased risk of developing health problems such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and prediabetes.
 
Consumers in the United States spend an estimated $190 billion annually on obesity-related medical conditions; the average annual medical costs for those who are obese are more than $1,400 higher than those of people in a normal weight range. The United States weight loss market itself is estimated to be a $65 billion per year industry, including consumer spending on diet foods, drinks and low-calorie sweeteners; health clubs, fitness centers and workout videos; medically supervised and commercial weight loss programs; children’s weight loss camps; diet books; appetite suppressants and more. Portion-controlled, meal-replacement weight management programs are continuing to gain popularity, as consumers search for a safe and effective solution that provides balanced nutrition, effective weight loss, and valuable behavior-modification education.
 
Direct Sellers
 
Direct selling is a key component of our business strategy and distribution model. Direct sellers are highly motivated independent entrepreneurs. Key motivating factors include:
 

· | the opportunity to start, manage and grow their own business with minimal upfront capital investment;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the flexibility of direct selling and the ability to earn supplemental income;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the ability to enjoy a healthy work-life balance;
--+--------------------------------------------------


· | the social nature of the industry and the opportunity to market products they believe in; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the opportunity to complement other business pursuits.

The DSA estimates that 14% of U.S. households have a member who is a direct seller. The majority of direct sellers are women and almost 90% of all direct sellers operate their businesses part-time. We develop and market products and services that promote the success of our OPTAVIA Coaches, each a micro-entrepreneur who plays an integral role in our operating performance and growth. OPTAVIA Coaches are effective advocates for the Company’s mission and the sale of its nutrition products and health and wellness programs. We offer direct sellers business essentials, supplies and interactive marketing services that help them launch and organize their direct-selling business as an independent OPTAVIA Coach. In 2017, we were ranked in the DSA’s Top 20 list, a recognition given annually to the largest direct selling companies in the United States.
 
Markets
 
United States
 
The United States is our dominant market and we believe the United States continues to represent significant potential for growth given the high percentage of overweight or clinically obese adults - 71.6% of adults aged 20 and over are considered overweight or clinically obese. Sales of weight loss and health and wellness products and services are projected to grow at a compound average growth rate (“CAGR”) of 5% in the United States through 2022, according to industry research and analysis.
 
Industry growth is also being driven by growing consumer awareness and increasing demand for health and wellness products. Additionally, growing urban populations and the corresponding increase in disposable income across age groups are enabling consumers with increased purchasing power to embrace healthier lifestyles. The intensified interest in physical fitness, fitness center membership, increased public awareness and incidences of chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, stroke, osteoporosis and others have increased demand for health and wellness products. The nutrition and weight management segment of the industry continued to dominate the health and wellness market in 2017.
 
Our growth strategy in the United States is concentrated on building our direct sales network in regions of the country where we consider ourselves currently under-represented. In these regions we are targeting our word of mouth and social media marketing toward increasingly younger demographics; reaching out to important and increasingly diverse communities of health and wellness consumers, and identifying and marketing to consumers who are in varying stages of optimal well-being.
 
Asia Pacific
 
Global expansion is an important component of our long-term growth strategy. In February 2018, we announced our plans to expand into the Asia Pacific markets of Hong Kong and Singapore which we anticipate will occur in the first half of 2019. Our decision to enter these markets was based on industry market research that reflects a dynamic shift in how health care is being prioritized and consumed in those countries.
 
During 2018, we invested approximately $5 million in market preparation and development, including in-market testing and focus group research. Additionally, we are actively engaging our network of OPTAVIA Coaches in the United States to enhance facilitation of our international rollout. Our objective is to scale our Singapore and Hong Kong operations to achieve profitability and provide a platform for further expansion in the region. Our intent is to fund our global expansion ambitions without negatively impacting domestic operating margins.
 
Like the United States, healthy lifestyles have increasingly become a priority to middle-class consumers in the Asia Pacific markets as disposable income grows. Our research has found that while traditional remedies are still essential, consumers are increasingly incorporating healthy living products into their daily lives. In-market testing of our products and programs evoked strong consumer response and acceptance.
 
The Asia Pacific health and wellness market is projected to grow at the highest compound annual growth rate in the world through 2026. Asia Pacific is the third largest health and wellness marketplace in terms of revenue share and the fastest growing region, signaling robust growth over the next several years. The region also is a leading direct-selling marketplace, second only to the U.S.
 
PRODUCTS AND PROGRAMS 
 
Our proprietary products and programs have been scientifically-developed to help consumers achieve a healthy weight. We work closely with our cross-disciplinary Scientific Advisory Board comprised of physicians and scientists who help guide the development of our comprehensive portfolio of offerings. Our products are scientifically designed to provide the proper nutrition at every stage of a person’s journey toward a sustainable, healthy lifestyle. Our offerings are nutrient dense, portion controlled, and nutritionally interchangeable. 
 
Our trademarked Habits of Health provide the foundation for our successful Optimal Health plans and the OPTAVIA Integrated Coaching Model. We incorporate Healthy Habits in all our consumer offerings. The Habits of Health System is an innovative, mind and body lifestyle approach that encourages and educates consumers to replace unhealthy habits with healthy ones that contribute to their long-term success.
 
We identify opportunities to expand our product lines by regularly surveying our customer base and studying industry and consumer trends. This allows us to introduce new, high quality products that meet consumer demand.
 
OPTAVIA-BRANDED PRODUCTS
 
OPTAVIA-branded nutritional products we market include:
 
OPTAVIA Essential Fuelings. OPTAVIA Essential Fuelings contain 24 vitamins and minerals, high quality, complete protein, and no colors, flavors or sweeteners form artificial sources. Each Fueling has a nearly identical nutritional profile designed by our team of food scientists and refined by our registered dietitians and nutrition team. Each OPTAVIA Essential Fueling is scientifically formulated with the right balance of carbohydrates, protein and fat which helps promote a gentle, but efficient fat-burning state. Our Fuelings help our clients retain lean muscle mass and each contains our patented probiotic GanedenBC30® to support digestive health. Our OPTAVIA Coaches market OPTAVIA Essential Fuelings primarily through a suite of Optimal Weight Plans we have developed around the Habits of Health System.

OPTAVIA Select Fuelings. OPTAVIA Select Fuelings represent our Non-GMO line of products. These products have unique flavor profiles, work with the same suite of Optimal Weight Plans described above but are formulated for those who desire Non-GMO products.
 
OPTAVIA Coach Business Kit. We sell kits to direct-sales entrepreneurs who want to join the OPTAVIA Coach network. The kits provide new OPTAVIA Coaches with business essentials needed to successfully start their independent business, including business tools, plan information, business supplies and 12 months of free access to a personalized OPTAVIA website.
 
OPTAVIA-BRANDED PLANS 
 
Our OPTAVIA-branded health and wellness plans help consumers enter a gentle and efficient fat-burning state that is essential for losing weight. Their success is enhanced by the personal attention, counseling, education, advice and motivation they receive from our OPTAVIA Coaches. They also benefit from being members of a broader OPTAVIA Community of consumers with like-minded goals and objectives regarding their health. We offer consumers incentives to join the OPTAVIA Community, including support calls with a caring community, access to our knowledgeable Nutrition Support Team, exclusive offers through our OPTAVIA Premier service that help our clients stay on plan, as well as qualifies them for discounts on purchased products and free shipping. We focus our marketing efforts on providing daily support to our clients during the initial 30 days – OPTAVIA 30 – of their integration to Lifelong Transformation, One Healthy Habit at a Time. We encourage our clients to embrace our Six Steps to Optimal Health:
 

· | Prepare for your journey.
--+--------------------------


· | Achieve a healthy weight.
--+--------------------------


· | Transition to healthy eating.
--+------------------------------


· | Live the Habits of Health
--+--------------------------


· | Optimize health for your age.
--+------------------------------


· | Realize the potential to live a longer healthier life.
--+-------------------------------------------------------

 
The majority of our OPTAVIA Coaches began as weight-loss clients, who had success on the OPTAVIA program, and became OPTAVIA Coaches to help others through the weight-loss process.
 
Optimal Weight plans we market to consumers are:
 
The Optimal Weight 5 & 1 Plan®. Our proven Optimal Weight 5 & 1 Plan encourages consumers to eat six small meals a day, an important habit that helps maintain healthy weight. Five daily meals are OPTAVIA Fuelings, offering consumers a choice from more than 60 delicious, convenient, nutritionally interchangeable, scientifically-designed products, including shakes, soups, bars, hot beverages, hearty choices, biscuits, pretzels, pudding, and brownies. OPTAVIA Coaches counsel their clients on which Fuelings to select. OPTAVIA Coaches also counsel their clients on how to develop healthy habits, such as preparing lean and green meals and choosing healthy snacks.
 
Optimal Weight 4 & 2 & 1 Plan®. The Optimal Weight 4 & 2 & 1 Plan is designed for consumers who want to continue eating all food groups or want a flexible meal plan to help them achieve a healthy weight. Under this plan, OPTAVIA Coaches counsel their clients to eat four meals of OPTAVIA Fuelings and prepare two lean and green meals and one healthy snack themselves.
 
Optimal Health 3 & 3 Plan®. The Optimal Health 3 & 3 plan is designed for consumers who want to sustain a healthy weight. This plan focuses on nutritionally balanced, small meals eaten every two or three hours, similar to our Optimal Weight plans, while integrating more food choices in the right portions. Consumers are counseled by their OPTAVIA Coaches to eat three Optimal Health Fuelings and three balanced meals they prepare themselves daily.
 
THE MEDIFAST® BRAND 
 
While OPTAVIA now accounts for a majority of our revenue, we continue to market products under the Medifast brand name. About 33% of our consumable units sold in 2018 were tied to the Medifast brand. We offer a variety of weight loss, weight management, and healthy living products under the Medifast, Thrive by Medifast, Optimal Health, Flavor of Homes and Essential 1 brands.
 
Our Medifast meal replacement line includes more than 65 options, including, but not limited to, bars, bites, pretzels, puffs, cereal crunch, drinks, hearty choices, oatmeal, pancakes, pudding, soft serve, shakes, smoothies, soft bakes, and soups. Our Thrive by Medifast line includes a variety of specially formulated bars, shakes, and smoothies for our clients who are maintaining their weight for long-term healthy living.
 
MAJOR CUSTOMERS
 
Sales are made to clients. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of revenue.
 
SEASONALITY
 
Weight management products and programs are typically seasonal. Traditionally, the predisposition of consumers not to initiate a weight loss or management program during the holiday season impacts the fourth quarter with fewer sales of weight management products and services during these months. January and February generally show increases in sales, as these months are considered the commencement of the “diet season.” We believe our sales pattern does not follow the seasonality of our industry, but rather is predicated on the growth of our OPTAVIA Coach network. Selling general and administrative costs do exhibit some seasonality as our annual convention is held during the third quarter of each fiscal year. In 2018 and 2017, our sales increased sequentially each quarter.

SCIENTIFIC ADVISORY BOARD
 
Medifast has a Scientific Advisory Board that consists of a multi-disciplinary, international panel that serves as the foundation for scientifically-valid, consumer-centric, high quality innovations for lasting health. Its mission is to help guide Medifast in making informed decisions regarding medical, nutritional, and scientific matters by providing expertise and information on research and emerging trends.
 
The work of this cross-disciplinary group builds on Medifast’s heritage of medically sound approaches to weight loss, and the incorporation of leading-edge clinical research into the Company’s products and programs.
 
COMPETITION
 
The weight-loss industry is very competitive and encompasses various weight loss products and programs. These include a wide variety of commercial weight-loss programs, pharmaceutical products, books, self-help diets, dietary meal replacements, appetite suppressants, and meal replacements, as well as, digital tools and wearable trackers. The weight loss market is served by a diverse array of competitors. Potential clients seeking to manage their weight can turn to other traditional center-based competitors, online diet oriented sites, self-directed dieting and self-administered products such as prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs and supplements, as well as medically supervised programs.
 
We also compete with other direct selling organizations, some of which have a longer operating history, and greater visibility, name recognition and financial resources than we do. Medifast’s identified peers and competitors in the general health and wellness diet industry include NutriSystem Inc., USANA Health Sciences Inc., Weight Watchers International, Inc., Farmer Brothers Company, Inter Parfums Inc., Inventure Foods Inc., Jamba Inc., Lifevantage Corp., Nature’s Sunshine Products Inc., and Omega Protein Corp, which was acquired by Cooke Inc. in 2017.
 
The Company believes that it competes effectively in the weight-loss industry and differentiates itself from the competition.
 
The Company believes its scientific and clinical heritage and commitment to evaluating its products and programs through clinical research are primary differentiators that allow it to compete in this market. Our products were originally developed by a physician, and Medifast has been on the cutting edge in the development of nutritional and weight-management products since the Company was founded. Medifast meals are individually portioned, calorie- and carbohydrate-controlled meal replacements that share a similar nutritional “footprint” and provide a balance of protein and good carbohydrates, including fiber.
 
Our OPTAVIA Integrated Coaching Model offers the personal support of an OPTAVIA Coach, who is often a person who has achieved success with OPTAVIA and has turned their success into a business opportunity. Medifast weight management programs utilize meal replacements as part of a structured meal plan that clinical research has shown to be effective for weight loss.
 
MARKETING 
 
We continue to build and leverage our core brands through multiple marketing strategies. Customer acquisition and retention strategies include word-of-mouth, digital marketing, public relations, social media, email marketing, events, and other means. These mediums are used to target new clients by stressing Medifast's and OPTAVIA’s simple and effective approach to weight loss and management and long term health. Many of these programs are also utilized to reactivate, encourage and support existing clients, and OPTAVIA Coaches. We are constantly working to enhance all of our company materials and websites.
 
MANUFACTURING 
 
Jason Pharmaceuticals, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, manufactures and produces the majority of our powder-based products, which account for approximately 45% of our unit sales, at our manufacturing facility in Owings Mills, Maryland. A portion of powder-based products are packaged by a third-party vendor in accordance with Medifast manufacturing standards. We purchased the plant in July 2002 and have gradually increased production capacity and improved overall efficiencies with additional investments in blending and packaging equipment. The remaining 55% of our products are manufactured by third-party vendors in accordance with Medifast proprietary formulas and manufacturing standards. Our Owings Mills manufacturing facility is regulated and inspected by the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), the United States Department of Agriculture (the “USDA”) and the Maryland State Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. It is certified by the SQF Institute as a Safe Quality Food Program (the “SQF”) Level 2 facility compliant with the Global Food Safety Initiative, a global non-profit collaboration to advance food safety.
GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION
 
In every jurisdiction in which we operate, our business is subject to extensive governmental regulation. These regulations exist at various national and local levels and pertain to our OPTAVIA Coaching marketing program, our products, and other aspects of our business. In this section, we describe the regulations that are applicable to our business.
 
Direct Selling Regulations
 
Direct selling is regulated by various national, state and local government agencies in the United States and foreign markets. These laws and regulations are generally intended to prevent fraudulent or deceptive schemes, including "pyramid" schemes, which compensate participants primarily for recruiting additional participants without significant emphasis on product sales to consumers. The laws and regulations governing direct selling may be modified or reinterpreted from time to time, which may cause us to modify our sales compensation and business models. In almost all of our markets, regulations are subject to discretionary interpretation by regulators and judicial authorities. There is often ambiguity and uncertainty with respect to the state of direct selling and anti-pyramiding laws and regulations. In the United States, for example, federal law provides law enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"), broad latitude in policing unfair or deceptive trade practices, but does not provide a bright-line test for identifying a pyramid scheme. Several states have passed legislation that more clearly distinguishes between illegal pyramid schemes and legitimate multi-level marketing business models. Recent settlements between the FTC and other direct selling companies and guidance from the FTC have addressed inappropriate earnings and lifestyle claims and the importance of focusing on consumers. These developments have created a level of ambiguity as to the proper interpretation of the law and related court decisions. For example, in 2015, the FTC took aggressive actions against a multi-level marketing company, alleging an illegal business model and inappropriate earnings claims. We have taken additional steps to educate our distributors on proper earnings claims. If our distributors make improper claims, or if regulators determine we are making any improper claims, this could lead to an FTC investigation and could harm our business.

-

 

In 2016, the FTC entered into a settlement with another multi-level marketing company, requiring the company to modify its business model, including basing sales compensation and qualification only on sales to retail and preferred customers and on purchases by a distributor for personal consumption within allowable limits. Although this settlement does not represent judicial precedent or a new FTC rule, the FTC has indicated that the industry should look at this settlement, and the principles underlying its specific measures, for guidance. If the requirements in this settlement lead to new industry standards or new rules, our business could be impacted and we may need to amend our global sales compensation plan. With a majority of our revenue in the United States coming from sales to retail and preferred customers, we believe that we can demonstrate consumer demand for our products, but we continue to monitor developments to assess whether we should make any changes to our business or global sales compensation plan. If we are required to make changes or if the FTC seeks to enforce similar measures in the industry, either through rulemaking or an enforcement action against our company, our business could be harmed.
 
Other Regulations
 
A number of laws and regulations govern our advertising and marketing, services, products, operations and relations with consumers, franchisees, and other service providers and government authorities in the countries in which we operate.
 
The formulation, processing, packaging, labeling, marketing, advertising and selling of the Company's products is subject to regulation by federal, state and local agencies. Products must comply with the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Food Safety Modernization Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, State Consumer Protection laws and several other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable in localities in which the Company products are made or are sold.
 
The FDA and USDA and State and local Health departments are the major agencies whose regulatory mission is to assure that products are made using approved ingredients, labeling, manufacturing procedures and testing to ensure that safe quality products are delivered to consumers.
 
Laws and regulations directly applicable to data protection and communications, operations or commerce over the Internet, such as those governing intellectual property, privacy and taxation, continue to evolve. Our operations are subject to these laws and regulations and we continue to monitor their development and our compliance. In addition, we are subject to other laws and regulations in the United States and internationally.
 
The FTC has principal regulatory authority over the Company’s advertising and trade practices, its enforcement powers are aimed at protecting the consumer from being deceived by unfair marketing and trading practices.
 
During the mid-1990s, the FTC filed complaints against a number of commercial weight management providers alleging violations of federal law in connection with the use of advertisements that featured testimonials claims for program success and program costs. In 2012, Jason Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a consent decree with the FTC regarding certain statements included in the advertising for the Company’s weight-loss programs. The consent decree requires us to comply with certain procedures and disclosures in connection with our advertisements of products and services.
 
PRODUCT LIABILITY AND INSURANCE 
 
The Company, like other producers and distributors of ingested products, faces an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that, among other things, the use of its products results in injury or death. The Company maintains insurance against product liability claims with respect to the products it manufactures. With respect to the retail and direct marketing distribution of products produced by others, the Company's principal form of insurance consists of arrangements with each of its suppliers of those products to name the Company a covered entity under each of such vendor's product liability insurance policies. The Company does not buy products from suppliers who do not maintain such coverage.
BACKLOG
 
Our products are typically shipped within 24 hours after receipt of an order. As of February 15, 2019, we had no significant backlog of orders.
 
WORKING CAPTIAL PRACTICES
 
We maintain sufficient amounts of inventory in stock in order to provide a high level of service to our clients. Substantial inventories are required to meet the needs of our dual role as manufacturer and distributor.
ENVIRONMENT LAWS
 
We are not aware of any instance in which we have contravened federal, state, or local laws relating to protection of the environment or in which we otherwise may be subject to liability for environmental conditions that could materially affect operations.

INFORMATION SYSTEMS INFRASTRUCTURE
 
Our websites are based on commercially developed software and are hosted by cloud service providers and at a colocation data center located in Baltimore, Maryland. The hosting facilities provide carrier diverse network connectivity, redundant and emergency power, fire prevention and control, and robust physical security for the equipment on which our websites rely. Our information systems and infrastructure are monitored 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Annually we evaluate the compliance of key service organizations with SSAE 18 standards by reviewing the relevant System and Organization Controls reports (SOC 1, SOC 2 and SOC 3), in addition to PCI DSS compliance, where applicable.
 
We use a variety of security techniques to protect our confidential customer data, including regularly scheduled penetration security tests on our websites. We also use an industry leading network monitoring service for our Intrusion Detection Services solution along with Intrusion Prevention System devices on our network’s perimeter. When our clients place an order or access their account information, we use secure channels to encrypt and transmit information. Our security certificates encrypt all information entered before it is sent to our servers. We have a secondary firewall layer of security between our customer facing websites and the databases that house their information and we have deployed mitigation devices to protect against Distributed Denial of Service attacks. Customer data is protected against unauthorized access. We have a redundant network across our organization, which provides for inter-connectivity and redundancy for our corporate locations.
 
As our operations grow in both size and scope, we will continue to improve and upgrade our information systems and infrastructure while maintaining their reliability and integrity.
