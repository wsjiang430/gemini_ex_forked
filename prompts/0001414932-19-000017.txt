Item 1. Business 
General
Oaktree Specialty Lending Corporation, a Delaware corporation, or together with its subsidiaries, where applicable, the Company, which may also be referred to as “we,” “us” or “our”, is a specialty finance company dedicated to providing customized, one-stop credit solutions to companies with limited access to public or syndicated capital markets. We were formed in late 2007 and currently operate as a closed-end, externally managed, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a Business Development Company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. In addition, we have qualified and elected to be treated as a regulated investment company, or RIC, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, for tax purposes. As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any net ordinary income or net realized capital gains that we distribute to our stockholders if we meet certain source-of-income, income distribution and asset diversification requirements.
As of October 17, 2017, we are externally managed by Oaktree Capital Management, L.P., which we also refer to as “Oaktree” or our “Adviser,” pursuant to an investment advisory agreement, as amended from time to time, or the Investment Advisory Agreement, between the Company and Oaktree. Oaktree is a subsidiary of Oaktree Capital Group, LLC, or OCG. In 2019, Brookfield Asset Management Inc., which we refer to as "Brookfield," acquired a majority economic interest in OCG. OCG operates as an independent business within Brookfield, with its own product offerings and investment, marketing and support teams. Oaktree Fund Administration, LLC, which we refer to as “Oaktree Administrator,” a subsidiary of our Adviser, provides certain administrative and other services necessary for us to operate. 
We seek to generate current income and capital appreciation by providing companies with flexible and innovative financing solutions, including first and second lien loans, unsecured and mezzanine loans, bonds, preferred equity and certain equity co-investments. We may also seek to generate capital appreciation and income through secondary investments at discounts to par in either private or syndicated transactions. We invest in companies that typically possess business models we expect to be resilient in the future with underlying fundamentals that will provide strength in future downturns. We intend to deploy capital across credit and economic cycles with a focus on long-term results, which we believe will enable us to build lasting partnerships with financial sponsors and management teams, and we may seek to opportunistically take advantage of dislocations in the financial markets and other situations that may benefit from our Adviser’s credit and structuring expertise. Sponsors may include financial sponsors, such as an institutional investor or a private equity firm, or a strategic entity seeking to invest in a portfolio company.
Our Adviser intends to continue to reposition our portfolio into investments that are better aligned with our Adviser's overall approach to credit investing and that it believes have the potential to generate attractive returns across market cycles. Our Adviser is generally focused on middle-market companies, which we define as companies with enterprise values of between $100 million and $750 million. We expect our portfolio to include a mix of first and second lien loans, including asset backed loans, unitranche loans, mezzanine loans, unsecured loans, bonds, preferred equity and certain equity co-investments. Our portfolio may also include certain structured finance and other non-traditional structures. We generally invest in securities that are rated below investment grade by rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. Below investment grade securities, which are often referred to as “high yield” and “junk,” have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal.
Our portfolio totaled $1.4 billion at fair value as of September 30, 2019 and was comprised of 104 portfolio companies. These included debt investments in 79 companies, equity investments in 33 companies, including our limited partnership interests in two private equity funds, and our investment in Senior Loan Fund JV I, LLC, or the SLF JV I. Nine of these equity investments were in companies in which we also had a debt investment. At fair value, 91.0% of our portfolio consisted of debt investments and 78.6% of our portfolio consisted of senior secured loans as of September 30, 2019. The weighted average annual yield of our debt investments at fair value as of September 30, 2019, including the Company's share of the return on our debt investment in SLF JV I, was approximately 8.9%, including 8.1% representing cash payments. The weighted average annual yield of our debt investments is determined before the payment of, and therefore does not take into account, our expenses and the payment by an investor of any stockholder transaction expenses, and does not represent the return on investment for our stockholders. 
We are permitted to, and expect to continue to, finance our investments through borrowings. However, as a Business Development Company, subject to certain limited exceptions, we are currently only allowed to borrow amounts in accordance with the asset coverage requirements in the Investment Company Act. We generally expect to target a long-term debt to equity ratio of 0.70x to 0.85x (i.e., one dollar of equity for each $0.70 to $0.85 of debt outstanding). As of September 30, 2019, we 
1

had a debt to equity ratio of 0.51x (i.e., one dollar of equity for each $0.51 of debt outstanding). At a special meeting of stockholders held on June 28, 2019, our stockholders approved the application of the reduced asset coverage requirements in Section 61(a)(2) of the Investment Company Act to us, effective as of June 29, 2019. The reduced asset coverage requirements permit us to double the maximum amount of leverage that we are permitted to incur by reducing the asset coverage requirements applicable to us from 200% to 150%. As a result of the reduced asset coverage requirement, we can incur $2 of debt for each $1 of equity as compared to $1 of debt for each $1 of equity. 
Our Adviser 
We are externally managed and advised by Oaktree, a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or the Advisers Act. Oaktree, subject to the overall supervision of our Board of Directors, manages our day-to-day operations, and provides investment advisory services to us pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement.
Our Adviser is a leading global investment management firm headquartered in Los Angeles, California, focused on less efficient markets and alternative investments. A number of our Adviser’s senior executives and investment professionals have been investing together for over 33 years and have generated impressive investment performance through multiple market cycles. As of September 30, 2019, our Adviser (together with its affiliates) had approximately $122 billion in assets under management1. Our Adviser emphasizes an opportunistic, value-oriented and risk-controlled approach to investments in distressed debt, corporate debt (including high-yield debt and senior loans), control investing, real estate, convertible securities and listed equities.
In 2019, Brookfield acquired a majority economic interest in OCG. OCG operates as an independent business within Brookfield, with its own product offerings and investment, marketing and support teams. Brookfield is a leading global alternative asset manager with a 120-year history and over $500 billion of assets under management (inclusive of Oaktree) across a broad portfolio of real estate, infrastructure, renewable power, credit and private equity assets. Commencing in 2022, Oaktree's founders, senior management and current and former employee-unitholders of OCG will be able to sell their remaining OCG units to Brookfield over time pursuant to an agreed upon liquidity schedule and approach to valuing such units at the time of liquidation. Pursuant to this liquidity schedule, the earliest year in which Brookfield could own 100% of the OCG business is 2029.
Our Adviser’s primary firm-wide goal is to achieve attractive returns while bearing less than commensurate risk. Our Adviser believes that it can achieve this goal by taking advantage of market inefficiencies in which financial markets and their participants fail to accurately value assets or fail to make available to companies the capital that they reasonably require.
Our Adviser believes that its defining characteristic is its adherence to the highest professional standards, which has yielded several important benefits. First and foremost, this characteristic has allowed our Adviser to attract and retain an extremely talented group of investment professionals, or the Investment Professionals. As of September 30, 2019, our Adviser had over 950 professionals in 18 cities and 13 countries, including 39 portfolio managers with an average experience of 24 years and approximately 950 years of combined industry experience. Specifically, the Strategic Credit group that is primarily responsible for implementing our investment strategy consists of over 20 Investment Professionals led by Armen Panossian, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer, who focus on the investment strategy employed by our Adviser and certain of its affiliates. Second, it has permitted the investment team to build strong relationships with brokers, banks and other market participants. These institutional relationships have been instrumental in strengthening access to trading opportunities, to understanding the current market, and to executing the investment team’s investment strategies.
Our Adviser and its affiliates provide discretionary investment management services to other managed accounts and investment funds, which may have overlapping investment objectives and strategies with our own and, accordingly, may invest in asset classes similar to those targeted by us. The activities of such managed accounts and investment funds may raise actual or potential conflicts of interest

1 References to “assets under management” or “AUM” represent assets managed by our Adviser and a proportionate amount of the AUM reported by DoubleLine Capital LP, or Doubleline, in which our Adviser owns a 20% minority interest. Our Adviser’s methodology for calculating AUM includes (i) the net asset value of assets managed directly by our Adviser, (ii) the leverage on which management fees are charged, (iii) undrawn capital that our Adviser is entitled to call from investors in Oaktree funds pursuant to their capital commitments, (iv) for collateralized loan obligation vehicles, or CLOs, the aggregate par value of collateral assets and principal cash, (v) for publicly-traded Business Development Companies, gross assets (including assets acquired with leverage), net of cash, and (vi) our Adviser’s pro rata portion of the AUM reported by DoubleLine. Our Adviser’s calculation of AUM may differ from the calculations of other asset managers and, as a result, our Adviser’s measurements of AUM may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers. Our Adviser’s definition of AUM is not based on the definitions of AUM that may be set forth in agreements governing the investment funds, vehicles or accounts that it manages and is not calculated pursuant to regulatory definitions.

Strategic Credit
Our Adviser officially launched its Strategic Credit strategy in early 2013 as a step-out from its Distressed Debt strategy, to capture attractive investment opportunities that appear to offer too little return for distressed debt investors, but may pose too much uncertainty for high-yield bond creditors. The strategy seeks to achieve an attractive total return by investing in public and private performing debt.
Strategic Credit focuses on U.S. and non-U.S. investment opportunities that arise from pricing inefficiencies that occur in the primary and secondary markets or from the financing needs of healthy companies with limited access to traditional lenders or public markets. Typical investments will be in high yield bonds and senior secured loans for borrowers that are in need of direct loans, rescue financings, or other capital solutions or that have had challenged or unsuccessful primary offerings.
The Investment Professionals employ a fundamental, value-driven opportunistic approach to credit investing, which seeks to benefit from the resources, relationships and proprietary information of our Adviser’s global investment platform.
Our Administrator
We entered into an administration agreement, as amended from time to time, or the Administration Agreement, with Oaktree Administrator, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Oaktree. The principal executive offices of Oaktree Administrator are located at 333 South Grand Avenue, 28th Floor, Los Angeles, CA 90071. Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, Oaktree Administrator provides services to us, and we reimburse Oaktree Administrator for costs and expenses incurred by Oaktree Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement and providing personnel and facilities thereunder.
Business Strategy
We seek to generate current income and capital appreciation by providing companies with flexible and innovative financing solutions, including first and second lien loans, unsecured and mezzanine loans, bonds, preferred equity and certain equity co-investments. We may also seek to generate capital appreciation and income through secondary investments at discounts to par in either private or syndicated transactions. We invest in companies across a variety of industries that typically possess business models we expect to be resilient in the future with underlying fundamentals that will provide strength in future downturns. We deploy capital across credit and economic cycles with a focus on long-term results, which we believe will enable us to build lasting partnerships with financial sponsors and management teams, and we may seek to opportunistically take advantage of dislocations in the financial markets and other situations that may benefit from our Adviser’s deep credit and structuring expertise. Our Adviser intends to implement the following business strategy to achieve our investment objective:

• | Emphasis on Proprietary Deals. Our Adviser is focused on proprietary opportunities as well as partnering with other lenders as appropriate. Dedicated sourcing professionals of our Adviser are in continuous contact with financial sponsors and corporate clients to originate proprietary deals and seek to leverage the networks and relationships of Oaktree’s Investment Professionals with management teams and corporations to originate non-sponsored transactions. Since 2005, our Adviser has invested more than $14 billion in over 250 directly originated loans, and the Oaktree platform has the capacity to invest in large deals and to solely underwrite transactions. 


• | Focus On Quality Companies And Extensive Diligence. Our Adviser seeks to maintain a conservative approach to investing with discipline around fundamental credit analysis and downside protection. Our Adviser intends to focus on companies with business models we expect to be resilient in the future, underlying fundamentals that will provide strength in future downturns, significant asset or enterprise value and seasoned management teams, although not all portfolio companies will meet each of these criteria. Our Adviser intends to leverage its deep credit and deal structuring expertise to lend to companies that have unique needs, complex business models or specific business challenges. Our Adviser conducts diligence on underlying collateral value, including cash flows, hard assets or intellectual property, and will typically model exit scenarios as part of the diligence process, including assessing potential “work-out” scenarios. 


• | Disciplined Portfolio Management. Our Adviser monitors our portfolio on an ongoing basis to manage risk and take preemptive action to resolve potential problems where possible. Our Adviser intends to seek to reduce the impact of individual investment risks by diversifying portfolios across industry sectors and, with the exception of investment vehicles with a diversified portfolio, limiting positions to no more than 5% of our portfolio. 


• | Manage Risk Through Loan Structures. Our Adviser seeks to leverage its experience in identifying structural risks in prospective portfolio companies and developing customized solutions in an effort to enhance downside 

3

protection where possible. Our Adviser has the expertise to structure comprehensive, flexible and customized solutions for companies of all sizes across numerous industry sectors. Our Adviser employs a rigorous due diligence process and seeks to include covenant protections designed to ensure that we, as the lender, can negotiate with a portfolio company before a deal reaches impairment. The Oaktree platform has the ability to address a wide range of borrower needs, with capability to invest across the capital structure and to fund large loans, and our Adviser pays close attention to market trends. Our Adviser provides certainty to borrowers by seeking to provide fully underwritten financing commitments and has expertise in both performing credit as well as restructuring and turnaround situations, which we expect will allow us to invest and lend during times of market stress when our competitors may halt investment activity.

• | Completion of Portfolio Repositioning. Since becoming our Adviser, Oaktree has reduced the investments it has identified as non-core by nearly $700 million at fair value. Over time, Oaktree intends to rotate us out of the remaining non-core investments, which is approximately $200 million at fair value as of September 30, 2019. Our Adviser intends to generate a competitive return on equity and sustainable, consistent dividends through (1) opportunistically investing across the capital structure, (2) seeking to take advantage of dislocations in financing markets and other situations that may benefit from our Adviser’s restructuring expertise and (3) generating capital appreciation and income through secondary investments at discounts to par in either private or syndicated transactions. 

Our Adviser’s emphasis is on fundamental credit analysis, consistency and downside protection, all of which are key tenets of its investment philosophy. We believe this philosophy strongly aligns with the interests of our stockholders. Our Adviser controls primarily for risk, rather than return. Although this may lead us to underperform in bullish markets, we expect that prudence across the economic cycle and limiting losses will allow us to achieve our investment objectives.
Identification of Investment Opportunities
The Investment Professionals employ a rigorous process to identify and evaluate potential investments. Central to the Investment Professionals’ investment process is the goal of exploiting market dislocations and inefficiencies driven by macro factors, market-level changes and company characteristics.
Macro Factors
Macro factors that drive market dislocations occur throughout the global economy and include sovereign debt crises, political elections and other unexpected geopolitical events. These factors drive highly correlated “risk on” and “risk off” market swings and frequently result in the indiscriminate selling or buying of securities and obligations at prices that the Investment Professionals believe are well below or above their intrinsic values.
Market-Level Changes
We believe that many commercial banks have decreased their lending to middle-market companies in recent years, which has created an opportunity for non-traditional market participants. In addition, we believe that increased regulation of financial markets and its participants, such as Basel III and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, has resulted in traditional capital providers focusing on only higher-quality and more liquid opportunities. The lower-rated portion of the market is often less efficiently priced due to limited capital availability, which allows for more attractive risk and return opportunities.
Company Characteristics
Company-specific factors that drive market dislocations include over-leveraged balance sheets, near-term liquidity or maturity issues, secular pressures on businesses, acute shock to company operations, asset-light businesses and new or relatively small issuers. These factors may result in mispriced securities or obligations or require a highly structured direct loan.
The Investment Professionals believe current market conditions give rise to two primary sources of investment opportunities with favorable risk-reward characteristics. The first source is private debt, which capitalizes on the Investment Professionals’ experience in negotiating and structuring complex debt investments. Private debt can include (a) loan portfolios that banks need to sell in response to regulatory capital pressure, (b) capital solutions, which involve customized, negotiated solutions for companies unable to access traditional syndicated loan and high yield markets, (c) rescue financings, which are transactions structured to provide liquidity to companies with overleveraged balance sheets, often on an urgent basis and (d) other direct loan investments to support acquisitions or capital projects that are unable to obtain financing via more traditional channels. The second source is marketable securities or other forms of traded debt, which the Investment Professionals intend to purchase on the secondary market at prices they believe are below their intrinsic value. Once the Investment Professionals 
4

have identified a potential investment opportunity, they will evaluate the opportunity against the following investment criteria and guidelines. However, not all of these criteria will be met by each prospective portfolio company in which we invest.

• | Covenant Protections. We generally expect to invest in loans that have covenants that may help to minimize our risk of capital loss and meaningful equity investments in the portfolio company. We intend to target investments that have strong credit protections, including default penalties, information rights and affirmative, negative and financial covenants, such as limitations on debt incurrence, lien protection and prohibitions on dividends. 


• | Sustainable Cash Flow. Our investment philosophy places emphasis on fundamental analysis from an investor’s perspective and has a distinct value orientation. We intend to focus on companies with significant asset or enterprise value in which we can invest at relatively low multiples of normalized operating cash flow. Additionally, we anticipate investing in companies with a demonstrated ability or credible plan to de-lever. Typically, we will not invest in start-up companies, companies having speculative business plans or structures that could impair capital over the long-term although we may target certain earlier stage companies that have yet to reach profitability.


• | Experienced Management Team. We generally will look to invest in portfolio companies with an experienced management team and proper incentive arrangements, including equity compensation, to induce management to succeed and to act in concert with our interests as investors. 


• | Strong Relative Position In Its Market. We intend to target companies with what we believe to be established and leading market positions within their respective markets and well-developed long-term business strategies. 


• | Exit Strategy. We generally intend to invest in companies that we believe will provide us with the opportunity to exit our investments in three to eight years, including through (1) the repayment of the remaining principal outstanding at maturity, (2) the recapitalization of the company resulting in our debt investments being repaid and (3) the sale of the company resulting in the repayment of all of its outstanding debt.


• | Geography. As a Business Development Company, we will invest at least 70% of our investments in U.S. companies. To the extent we invest in non-U.S. companies, we intend to do so in accordance with Investment Company Act limitations and only in jurisdictions with established legal frameworks and a history of respecting creditor rights. 

Investment Process
Our investment process consists of the following five distinct stages.
Source
Strategic Credit has dedicated sourcing professionals and also leverages its strong market presences and relationships across Oaktree’s global platform to gain access to opportunities from advisers, sponsors, banks, management teams, capital raising advisers and other sources. Our Adviser is a trusted partner to financial sponsors and management teams based on its long-term commitment and focus on lending across economic cycles. We believe this will give us access to proprietary deal flow and "first looks" at investment opportunities and that we are well-positioned for difficult and complex transactions. 
Screen Using Investment Criteria
We expect to be highly selective in making new investments. The initial screening process will typically include a review of the proposed capital structure of the portfolio company, including level of assets or enterprise value coverage, an assessment by our Adviser of the company’s management team and its equity ownership levels as well as the viability of its long-term business model, and a review of forecasted financial statements and liquidity profile. In addition, our Adviser may assess the prospect of industry or macroeconomic catalysts that may create enhanced value in the investment as well as the potential ability to enforce creditor rights, particularly where collateral is located outside of the United States.
Research
Prior to making any new investment, our Adviser intends to engage in an extensive due diligence process led by investment analysts assigned to each transaction. The analysts will assess a company’s management team, products, services, competitive position in its markets, barriers to entry and operating and financial performance, as well as the growth potential of its markets. In performing this evaluation, the analysts may use financial, descriptive and other due diligence materials provided by the target company, commissioned third party reports and internal sources, including members of the investment 
5

team, industry participants and experts with whom our Adviser has relationships. As part of the research process, our Adviser’s analysts typically perform a “what-if” analysis that explores a range of values for each proposed investment and a range of potential credit events.
Evaluate
Our Adviser assesses each potential investment through a rigorous, collaborative decision-making process. Our Adviser applies disciplined investment criteria and evaluates potential risk and reward of each investment with significant focus on downside risk. Our Adviser sizes investments at the portfolio level across a variety of characteristics, including based on the investment criteria described above.
Monitor
Our Adviser prioritizes managing risk. In managing our portfolio, our Adviser intends to monitor each portfolio company and be well-positioned to make hold and exit decisions when credit events occur, our collateral becomes overvalued or opportunities with more attractive risk/reward profiles are identified. Investment analysts are assigned to each investment to monitor industry developments, review company financial statements, attend company presentations and regularly speak with company management. Based on their monitoring, the Investment Professionals seek to determine the optimal time and strategy for exiting and maximizing the return on the investment, typically when prices or yields reach target valuations. In circumstances where a particular investment is underperforming, our Adviser intends to employ a variety of strategies to maximize its recovery based on the specific facts and circumstances of the underperforming investment, including actively working with the management to restructure all or a portion of the business, explore the possibility of a sale or merger of all or a portion of the assets, recapitalize or refinance the balance sheet, negotiate deferrals or other concessions from existing creditors and arrange new liquidity or new equity contributions. We believe that our Adviser’s experience with restructurings and our access to our Adviser’s deep knowledge, expertise and contacts in the distressed debt area will help us preserve the value of our investments.
Investments 
Our investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation. We target debt investments that will generate current income and also provide the opportunity for capital appreciation through our ownership of equity securities in certain of our portfolio companies. We seek to structure our debt investments to provide downside protection through strong credit protections, including default penalties, information rights and affirmative, negative and financial covenants, such as limitations on debt incurrence, lien protection and prohibitions on dividends, although not all of our investments will meet each of the criteria. Our Adviser has expertise in creative, efficient structuring and institutional knowledge of bankruptcy and restructurings, enabling our Adviser to focus on risk control. Our debt investments may be collateralized by a first or second lien on the assets of the portfolio company. As of September 30, 2019, 78.6% of our portfolio at fair value consisted of debt investments that were secured by first or second priority liens on the assets of the portfolio company.
Debt Investments
We intend to tailor the terms of each investment by negotiating a structure that seeks to protect our rights and manage our risk while creating incentives for the portfolio company to achieve its business plan. Our Adviser is generally focused on middle-market companies. We expect our portfolio to include a mix of senior secured loans, including asset backed loans, unitranche loans, unsecured and mezzanine loans, bonds, preferred equity and certain equity co-investments as well as certain structured finance and other non-traditional structures. A substantial source of return is monthly or quarterly interest that we collect on our debt investments, including payment-in-kind, or PIK, interest which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the principal that generally becomes due at maturity. Our debt investments may generally consist of the following:

• | First Lien Loans. Our first lien loans generally have terms of three to seven years, provide for a variable or fixed interest rate, contain prepayment penalties and are secured by a first priority security interest in all existing and future assets of the borrower. Our first lien loans may take many forms, including revolving lines of credit, term loans and acquisition lines of credit. 


• | Unitranche Loans. Our unitranche loans generally have terms of five to seven years and provide for a variable or fixed interest rate, contain prepayment penalties and are generally secured by a first priority security interest in all existing and future assets of the borrower. Our unitranche loans may take many forms, including revolving lines of credit, term loans and acquisition lines of credit. Unitranche loans typically provide a borrower with all of its capital except for common equity, often with higher interest rates than those associated with traditional first lien loans. 

6


• | Second Lien Loans. Our second lien loans generally have terms of five to eight years, provide for a variable or fixed interest rate, contain prepayment penalties and are secured by a second priority security interest in all existing and future assets of the borrower. 


• | Mezzanine Loans. Our mezzanine loans generally have maturities of five to ten years. Mezzanine loans may take the form of a second priority lien on the assets of a portfolio company and have interest-only payments in the early years with cash or PIK payments with amortization of principal deferred to the later years. In some cases, we may invest in debt securities that, by their terms, convert into equity or additional debt securities or defer payments of interest for the first few years after our investment. 


• | Unsecured Loans. Our unsecured investments generally have terms of five to ten years and provide for a fixed interest rate. We may make unsecured investments on a stand-alone basis, or in connection with a senior secured loan, a junior secured loan or a “one-stop” financing. 


• | Bonds. We may selectively invest in high yield corporate bonds issued by middle-market companies that are rated below investment grade by rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. The bonds in which we may invest are expected to have terms of five to eight years and provide for fixed interest rate payments. We do not expect that these bonds would be secured by any assets of the issuer. 

Equity Investments
When we make a debt investment, we may also be granted equity, such as warrants to purchase common stock in a portfolio company. To a lesser extent, we may also make preferred and/or common equity investments, which are usually in conjunction with a concurrent debt investment or the result of an investment restructuring. For non-control equity investments, we generally seek to structure our non-control equity investments to provide us with minority rights provisions and event-driven put rights. We also seek to obtain limited registration rights in connection with these investments, which may include “piggyback” registration rights.
SLF JV I
We and Trinity Universal Insurance Company, a subsidiary of Kemper Corporation, or Kemper, co-invest through SLF JV I, an unconsolidated Delaware limited liability company. SLF JV I was formed in May 2014 to invest in middle-market and other corporate debt securities. As of September 30, 2019, we and Kemper had funded an aggregate of approximately $165.5 million to SLF JV I, of which $144.8 million was from us. As of September 30, 2019, we and Kemper had the option to fund additional debt investments in SLF JV I, subject to additional equity funding to SLF JV I from us and Kemper. Additionally, SLF JV I has a senior revolving credit facility with Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch, as amended, or the Deutsche Bank I Facility, which permitted up to $250.0 million of borrowings as of September 30, 2019. Borrowings under the Deutsche Bank I Facility are secured by all of the assets of a special purpose financing subsidiary of SLF JV I. SLF JV I is managed by a four person Board of Directors, two of whom are selected by us and two of whom are selected by Kemper. SLF JV I is generally capitalized as transactions are completed and all portfolio decisions must be approved by its investment committee consisting of one representative selected by us and one representative selected by Kemper (with approval of each required). As of September 30, 2019, our investment in SLF JV I was approximately $126.3 million at fair value. We do not consolidate SLF JV I in our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Valuation Procedures 
As a Business Development Company, we may invest in illiquid debt and equity securities issued by private middle-market companies. We are required to carry our portfolio investments at market value or, if there is no readily available market value, at fair value as determined by our Board of Directors. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies – Investment Valuation” for a description of our investment valuation processes and procedures.

Investment Advisory Agreement
The following is a description of the Investment Advisory Agreement. 
Management Services
Subject to the overall supervision of our Board of Directors, Oaktree manages our day-to-day operations and provides us with investment advisory services. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, Oaktree:

• | determines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes;


• | identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments we make;


• | executes, closes, monitors and services the investments we make;


• | determines what securities and other assets we purchase, retain or sell;


• | performs due diligence on prospective portfolio companies; and


• | provides us with such other investment advisory, research and related services as we may, from time to time, reasonably required for the investment of our funds.

The Investment Advisory Agreement provides that Oaktree’s services are not exclusive to us and Oaktree is generally free to furnish similar services to other entities so long as its services to us are not impaired.
Management Fee
Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, we pay Oaktree a fee for its services under the investment advisory agreement consisting of two components: a base management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the base management fee payable to Oaktree and any incentive fees earned by Oaktree is ultimately borne by our common stockholders. 
Base Management Fee
Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.50% of total gross assets, including any investment made with borrowings, but excluding cash and cash equivalents. Effective May 3, 2019, the base management fee on the Company’s gross assets, including any investments made with borrowings, but excluding any cash and cash equivalents, that exceed the product of (A) 200% and (B) the Company’s net asset value will be 1.00%. For the avoidance of doubt, the 200% will be calculated in accordance with the Investment Company Act and will give effect to exemptive relief the Company received from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to debentures issued by a small business investment company subsidiary.
Incentive Fee
The incentive fee consists of two parts. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the first part of the incentive fee, which is referred to as the incentive fee on income or the Part I incentive fee, is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based upon our “pre-incentive fee net investment income” for the immediately preceding quarter. The payment of the incentive fee on income is subject to payment of a preferred return to investors each quarter (i.e., a “hurdle rate”), expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the most recently completed quarter, of 1.50%, subject to a “catch up” feature.
For this purpose, “pre-incentive fee net investment income” means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies, other than fees for providing managerial assistance) accrued during the fiscal quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, or OID, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation.
Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the calculation of the incentive fee on income for each quarter is as follows:


• | No incentive fee is payable to Oaktree in any quarter in which our pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the preferred return rate of 1.50% (the “preferred return”) on net assets.


• | 100% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the preferred return but is less than or equal to 1.8182% in any fiscal quarter is payable to Oaktree. We refer to this portion of the incentive fee on income as the “catch-up” provision, and it is intended to provide Oaktree with an incentive fee of 17.5% on all of our pre-incentive fee

net investment income when our pre-incentive fee net investment income reaches 1.8182% on net assets in any fiscal quarter. 

• | For any quarter in which our pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds 1.8182% on net assets, the incentive fee on income is equal to 17.5% of the amount of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, as the preferred return and catch-up will have been achieved.

There is no accumulation of amounts on the hurdle rate from quarter to quarter and accordingly there is no clawback of amounts previously paid if subsequent quarters are below the quarterly hurdle. 
The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of the incentive fee on income under the Investment Advisory Agreement:
Quarterly Incentive Fee on Income

(expressed as a percentage of net assets)

Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the second part of the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date) commencing with the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 and equals 17.5% of our realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from the beginning of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 through the end of each subsequent fiscal year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees under the Investment Advisory Agreement. Any realized capital gains, realized capital losses, unrealized capital appreciation and unrealized capital depreciation with respect to our portfolio as of the end of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 are excluded from the calculations of the second part of the incentive fee. 
Examples of Quarterly Incentive Fee Calculation under the Investment Advisory Agreement (A)
Example 1: Incentive Fee on Income for Each Quarter 
Alternative 1 
Assumptions
Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 2%
Preferred return under the Investment Advisory Agreement1 = 1.50%
Management fee under the Investment Advisory Agreement2 = 0.375%
Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.20%
Pre-incentive fee net investment income
(investment income - (management fee + other expenses)) = 1.425%
Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the preferred return under the Investment Advisory Agreement, therefore there is no incentive fee on income under the Investment Advisory Agreement.
9

Alternative 2
Assumptions 
Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 2.375%
Preferred return under the Investment Advisory Agreement1 = 1.50%
Management fee under the Investment Advisory Agreement2 = 0.375%
Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.20%
Pre-incentive fee net investment income
(investment income - (management fee + other expenses)) = 1.80%
Incentive fee = 17.5% × pre-incentive fee net investment income, subject to “catch-up”3
= 100% × (1.80% - 1.50%)
= 0.30%
Alternative 3
Assumptions 
Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 3.5%
Preferred return under the Investment Advisory Agreement1 = 1.50%
Management fee under the Investment Advisory Agreement2 = 0.375%
Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.20%
Pre-incentive fee net investment income
(investment income - (management fee + other expenses)) = 2.925%
Incentive fee = 17.5% × pre-incentive fee net investment income, subject to “catch-up”3
Incentive fee = 100% × “catch-up” + (17.5% × (pre-incentive fee net investment income - 1.8182%))
Catch-up = 1.8182% - 1.50% = 0.3182%
Incentive fee = (100% × 0.3182%) + (17.5% × (2.925% - 1.8182%))
= 0.3182% + (17.5% × 1.1068%)
= 0.3182% + 0.1937%
= 0.5119%
__________ 
(A) Solely for purposes of these illustrative examples, we have assumed that we have not incurred any leverage. However, we have in the past and expect to continue in the future to use leverage to partially finance our investments.

1. | Represents 6.0% annualized preferred return.


2. | Represents 1.50% annualized management fee.


3. | The “catch-up” provision is intended to provide our Adviser with an incentive fee of 17.5% on all of our pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a preferred return did not apply when our net investment income exceeds 1.50% in any calendar quarter and is not applied once our Adviser has received 17.5% of investment income in a quarter. The “catch-up” portion of our pre-incentive fee net investment income is the portion that exceeds the 1.50% preferred return but is less than or equal to approximately 1.8182% (that is, 1.50% divided by (1 - 0.175)) in any fiscal quarter.

Example 2: Incentive Fee on Capital Gains under the Investment Advisory Agreement 
Assumptions

• | Year 1: $10 million investment made in Company A (“Investment A”), $10 million investment made in Company B (“Investment B”), $10 million investment made in Company C (“Investment C”), $10 million investment made in Company D (“Investment D”) and $10 million investment made in Company E (“Investment E”).


• | Year 2: Investment A sold for $20 million, fair market value (“FMV”) of Investment B determined to be $8 million, FMV of Investment C determined to be $12 million, and FMV of Investments D and E each determined to be $10 million.


• | Year 3: FMV of Investment B determined to be $8 million, FMV of Investment C determined to be $14 million, FMV of Investment D determined to be $14 million and FMV of Investment E determined to be $16 million.


• | Year 4: Investment D sold for $12 million, FMV of Investment B determined to be $10 million, FMV of Investment C determined to be $16 million and FMV of Investment E determined to be $14 million.


• | Year 5: Investment C sold for $20 million, FMV of Investment B determined to be $14 million and FMV of Investment E determined to be $10 million.


• | Year 6: Investment B sold for $16 million and FMV of Investment E determined to be $8 million.


• | Year 7: Investment E sold for $8 million and FMV.

These assumptions are summarized in the following chart:

 | Investment A | Investment B | Investment C | Investment D | Investment E | Cumulative Unrealized Capital Depreciation | Cumulative Realized Capital Losses | Cumulative Realized Capital Gains
Year 1 | $10 million (cost basis) | $10 million (cost basis) | $10 million (cost basis) | $10 million (cost basis) | $10 million (cost basis) | -- | -- | -- 
Year 2 | $20 million (sale price) | $8 millionFMV | $12 million FMV | $10 million FMV | $10 million FMV | $2 million | -- | $10 million 
Year 3 | -- | $8 millionFMV | $14 million FMV | $14 million FMV | $16 million FMV | $2 million | -- | $10 million 
Year 4 | -- | $10 million FMV | $16 million FMV | $12 million (sale price) | $14 million FMV | -- | -- | $12 million 
Year 5 | -- | $14 million FMV | $20 million (sale price) | -- | $10 million FMV | -- | -- | $22 million 
Year 6 | -- | $16 million (sale price) | -- | -- | $8 million FMV | $2 million | -- | $28 million 
Year 7 | -- | -- | -- | -- | $8 million (sale price) | -- | $2 million | $28 million 

The Incentive Fee on Capital Gains under the Investment Advisory Agreement would be:

• | Year 1: None 


• | Year 2: Capital Gains Fee = 17.5% multiplied by ($10 million realized capital gains on sale of Investment A less $2 million cumulative capital depreciation) = $1.4 million 


• | Year 3: Capital Gains Fee = (17.5% multiplied by ($10 million cumulative realized capital gains less $2 million cumulative capital depreciation)) less $1.4 million cumulative Capital Gains Fee previously paid = $1.4 million less $1.4 million = $0.00 million 


• | Year 4: Capital Gains Fee = (17.5% multiplied by ($12 million cumulative realized capital gains)) less $1.4 million cumulative Capital Gains Fee previously paid = $2.1 million less $1.4 million = $0.7 million 


• | Year 5: Capital Gains Fee = (17.5% multiplied by ($22 million cumulative realized capital gains)) less $2.1 million cumulative Capital Gains Fee previously paid = $3.85 million less $2.1 million = $1.75 million 


• | Year 6: Capital Gains Fee = (17.5% multiplied by ($28 million cumulative realized capital gains less $2 million cumulative capital depreciation)) less $3.85 million cumulative Capital Gains Fee previously paid = $4.55 million less $3.85 million = $0.70 million 


• | Year 7: Capital Gains Fee = (17.5% multiplied by ($28 million cumulative realized capital gains less $2 million cumulative realized capital losses)) less $4.55 million cumulative Capital Gains Fee previously paid = $4.55 million less $4.55 million = $0.00 million 

Collection and Disbursement of Fees Owed to Our Former Adviser 
Under the Former Investment Advisory Agreement described below, both the base management fee and incentive fee on income were calculated and paid to our Former Adviser at the end of each quarter. In order to ensure that our Former Adviser received any compensation earned during the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the initial payment of the base management fee and incentive fee on income under the Investment Advisory Agreement covered the entire quarter in which the Investment Advisory Agreement became effective, and was calculated at a blended rate that reflected fee rates under the respective investment advisory agreements for the portion of the quarter in which our Former Adviser and Oaktree were serving as investment adviser. This structure allowed Oaktree to pay our Former Adviser the pro rata portion of the fees that were earned by, but not paid to, our Former Adviser for services rendered to us prior to October 17, 2017 of $1.1 million.
Duration and Termination
Unless earlier terminated as described below, the Investment Advisory Agreement will remain in effect until September 30, 2021 and thereafter from year-to-year if approved annually by our Board or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, including, in either case, approval by a majority of our directors who are not interested persons. The Investment Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of its assignment. The Investment Advisory Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days’ written notice to the other. 
11

The Investment Advisory Agreement may also be terminated, without penalty, upon the vote of a majority of our outstanding voting securities. 
Indemnification
The Investment Advisory Agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of their respective duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of their respective duties and obligations, Oaktree and its officers, managers, partners, members (and their members, including the owners of their members), agents, employees, controlling persons and any other person or entity affiliated with it, are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of Oaktree’s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement or otherwise as our investment adviser.
Fee Waiver
For the two-year period commencing on October 17, 2017, Oaktree will waive, to the extent necessary, any management or incentive fees payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement that exceed what would have been paid to the Former Adviser (as defined below) in the aggregate under the Former Investment Advisory Agreement (as defined below). 
Organization of our Adviser
Our Adviser is a Delaware limited partnership that is registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. The principal address of our Adviser is 333 South Grand Avenue, 28th Floor, Los Angeles, CA 90071.
Board Approval of the Investment Advisory Agreement 
Our Board of Directors met in person with Oaktree to consider the Investment Advisory Agreement on May 3, 2019. At the in-person meeting held on May 3, 2019, our Board of Directors, including all of the independent directors, unanimously approved the Investment Advisory Agreement. Such independent directors met separately with independent counsel in connection with their review of the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Brookfield transaction. In reaching its decision to approve the Investment Advisory Agreement, our Board of Directors, including all of the independent directors, reviewed a significant amount of information, which had been furnished by Oaktree at the request of independent counsel, on behalf of the independent directors. In reaching a decision to approve the Investment Advisory Agreement, our Board of Directors considered, among other things:

• | the nature, extent and quality of services performed by Oaktree;


• | the investment performance of us and funds managed by Oaktree with a similar investment objective to us;


• | the costs of services provided and the profits realized by Oaktree and its affiliates from their relationship with us;


• | the possible economies of scale that would be realized due to our growth;


• | whether fee levels reflect such economies of scale for the benefit of investors;


• | comparisons of services rendered to and fees paid by us with the services provided by and the fees paid to other investment advisers and the services provided to and the fees paid by other Oaktree clients; and


• | whether consummation of the Brookfield transaction would have any effect on the above considerations.

No single factor was determinative of the decision of our Board of Directors, including all of the independent directors, to approve the Investment Advisory Agreement and individual directors may have weighed certain factors differently. Throughout the process, the independent directors were advised by independent counsel. Following this process, our Board of Directors, including all of the independent directors, unanimously voted to approve the Investment Advisory Agreement subject to stockholder approval. Our stockholders approved the Investment Advisory Agreement on June 28, 2019.
Payment of Our Expenses
Our primary operating expenses are the payment of (i) a base management fee and any incentive fees and (ii) the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by Oaktree Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement. Our management fee compensates our Adviser for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, executing and servicing our investments. We generally bear all other expenses of our operations and transactions, including (without limitation) fees and expenses relating to:

• | expenses of offering our debt and equity securities;


• | the investigation and monitoring of our investments;

12


• | the cost of calculating our net asset value;


• | the cost of effecting sales and repurchases of shares of our common stock and other securities;


• | management and incentive fees payable pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement;


• | fees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making investments and valuing investments (including third-party valuation firms);


• | transfer agent, trustee and custodial fees;


• | interest payments and other costs related to our borrowings;


• | fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts (including attendance at investment conferences and similar events);


• | federal and state registration fees;


• | any exchange listing fees;


• | federal, state and local taxes;


• | independent directors’ fees and expenses;


• | brokerage commissions;


• | costs of mailing proxy statements, stockholders’ reports and notices;


• | costs of preparing government filings, including periodic and current reports with the SEC;


• | fidelity bond, liability insurance and other insurance premiums; and


• | printing, mailing, independent accountants and outside legal costs and all other direct expenses incurred by either our administrator or us in connection with administering our business, including payments under the Administration Agreement.

Former Investment Advisory Agreement
Prior to October 17, 2017, we were externally managed and advised by Fifth Street Management LLC, which we refer to as our “Former Adviser”, and we were named Fifth Street Finance Corp. The following is a description of the Former Investment Advisory Agreement, which was terminated on October 17, 2017. The Former Investment Advisory Agreement, dated March 20, 2017, was effective January 1, 2017 through its termination on October 17, 2017. 
Management Fee
Through October 17, 2017, we paid our Former Adviser a fee for its services under the Former Investment Advisory Agreement consisting of two components - a base management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the base management fee paid to our Former Adviser and any incentive fees earned by our Former Adviser were ultimately borne by our common stockholders.
Base Management Fee
As of January 1, 2016, the base management fee was calculated at an annual rate of 1.75% of our gross assets, including any borrowings for investment purposes but excluding cash and cash equivalents. The base management fee was payable quarterly in arrears and the fee for any partial month or quarter was appropriately prorated.
Incentive Fee
The incentive fee paid to the Former Adviser had two parts. The first part was calculated and payable quarterly in arrears at a rate of 20% based on our pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter subject to a “hurdle rate” of 1.75% per quarter and a “catch-up” provision. Our net investment income used to calculate this part of the incentive fee was also included in the amount of its gross assets used to calculate the 1.75% base management fee.
In the event the cumulative incentive fee on income accrued from January 1, 2017 (after giving effect to any reduction(s) pursuant to this paragraph for any prior fiscal quarters but not the quarter of calculation) exceeded 20.0% of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations since January 1, 2017, then the incentive fee on income for the quarter was reduced by an amount equal to (1) 25% of the incentive fee on income calculated for such quarter (prior to giving effect to any reduction pursuant to this paragraph) less (2) any base management fees waived by the Former Adviser for such fiscal quarter. For this purpose, the “cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations” was an amount, if positive, equal to the sum of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, base management fees, realized gains and losses and unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation from January 1, 2017.
13

There was no accumulation of amounts on the hurdle rate from quarter to quarter and accordingly there was no clawback of amounts previously paid if subsequent quarters were below the quarterly hurdle and there was no delay of payment if prior quarters were below the quarterly hurdle.
The second part of the incentive fee was determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year (or upon termination of the Former Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date) and equaled 20% of our realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of each fiscal year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees, provided that, the incentive fee determined as of September 30, 2008 was calculated for a period of shorter than twelve calendar months to take into account any realized capital gains computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation from inception.
Administration Agreement
Effective October 17, 2017, we are party to the Administration Agreement with Oaktree Administrator. Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, Oaktree Administrator provides administrative services to us necessary for our operations, which include providing office facilities, equipment, clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at such facilities and such other services as Oaktree Administrator, subject to review by our Board of Directors, shall from time to time deem to be necessary or useful to perform its obligations under the Administration Agreement. Oaktree Administrator may, on behalf of us, conduct relations and negotiate agreements with custodians, trustees, depositories, attorneys, underwriters, brokers and dealers, corporate fiduciaries, insurers, banks and such other persons in any such other capacity deemed to be necessary or desirable. Oaktree Administrator will make reports to our Board of Directors of its performance of obligations under the Administration Agreement and furnish advice and recommendations with respect to such other aspects of our business and affairs, in each case, as it shall determine to be desirable or as reasonably required by our Board of Directors; provided that Oaktree Administrator shall not provide any investment advice or recommendation.
Oaktree Administrator also provides portfolio collection functions for interest income, fees and warrants and is responsible for the financial and other records that we are required to maintain, and prepares, prints and disseminates reports to our stockholders and all other materials filed with the SEC. In addition, Oaktree Administrator assists us in determining and publishing our net asset value, overseeing the preparation and filing of our tax returns, and generally overseeing the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. Oaktree Administrator may also offer to provide, on our behalf, managerial assistance to our portfolio companies.
For providing these services, facilities and personnel, we reimburse Oaktree Administrator the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by Oaktree Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including our allocable portion of the rent of our principal executive offices (which are located in a building owned by a Brookfield affiliate) at market rates and our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our Chief Financial Officer, Chief Compliance Officer, their staffs and other non-investment professionals at Oaktree that perform duties for us. Such reimbursement is at cost, with no profit to, or markup by, Oaktree Administrator. 
The Administration Agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of their respective duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of their respective duties and obligations, Oaktree Administrator and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members (or their owners) and any other person or entity affiliated with it, are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of Oaktree Administrator’s services under the Administration Agreement or otherwise as our administrator. 
Unless earlier terminated as described below, the Administration Agreement will remain in effect until September 30, 2021 and thereafter from year-to-year if approved annually by our Board of Directors or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, including, in either case, approval by a majority of our directors who are not interested persons. The Administration Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days’ written notice to the other. The Administration Agreement may also be terminated, without penalty, upon the vote of a majority of our outstanding voting securities.
Former Administration Agreement
Prior to its termination by its terms on October 17, 2017, we were party to an administration agreement, or the Former Administration Agreement, with a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Former Adviser, or the Former Administrator. Pursuant to the Former Administration Agreement, our Former Administrator provided services substantially similar to those provided by Oaktree Administrator as described above under “– Administration Agreement.” For providing these services, facilities and personnel, we reimbursed the Former Administrator the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by it in performing its obligations under the Former Administration Agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of 
14

compensation and related expenses of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and their staffs. Such reimbursement was at cost, with no profit to, or markup by, our Former Administrator. Our allocable portion of our Former Administrator’s costs was determined based upon costs attributable to our operations versus costs attributable to the operations of other entities for which our Former Administrator provided administrative services.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities. We compete for investments with various other investors, such as other public and private funds, other Business Development Companies, commercial and investment banks, commercial finance companies and to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity funds, some of which may be our affiliates. Other Oaktree funds may have investment objectives that overlap with ours, which may create competition for investment opportunities. Many competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that will not be available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments than we do, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the Investment Company Act and the Code impose on us. The competitive pressures could impair our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a result of this competition, we may not be able to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure – We may face increasing competition for investment opportunities, which could reduce returns and result in losses."
Staffing 
We do not currently have any employees and do not expect to have any employees. Services necessary for our business are provided through the Administration Agreement and the Investment Advisory Agreement. 
Allocation of Investment Opportunities and Potential Conflicts of Interest
Our executive officers and directors, and certain members of our Adviser, serve or may serve as officers, directors or principals of entities that operate in the same or a related line of business as we do or of investment funds managed by our affiliates. For example, Oaktree presently serves as the investment adviser to Oaktree Strategic Income Corporation, or OCSI, a publicly-traded Business Development Company, and Oaktree Strategic Income II, Inc., or OSI II, a privately offered Business Development Company. All of our executive officers serve in substantially similar capacities for OCSI and OSI II, all of our independent directors serve as independent directors of OCSI, and one of our independent directors serves as an independent director of OSI II. OCSI has historically invested in senior secured loans, including first lien, unitranche and second lien debt instruments that pay interest at rates which are determined periodically on the basis of a floating base lending rate, made to private middle-market companies whose debt is rated below investment grade, similar to those we target for investment. OSI II also makes similar investments. Oaktree and its affiliates also manage and sub-advise private investment funds and accounts, and may manage other such funds and accounts in the future, which have investment mandates that are similar, in whole and in part, with ours. Therefore, there may be certain investment opportunities that satisfy the investment criteria for OCSI, OSI II and us as well as private investment funds and accounts advised or sub-advised by Oaktree or its affiliates. In addition, Oaktree and its affiliates may have obligations to investors in other entities that it advises or sub-advises, the fulfillment of which might not be in the best interests of us or our stockholders. 
For example, the personnel of our Adviser may face conflicts of interest in the allocation of investment opportunities to us and such other funds and accounts. Oaktree has investment allocation guidelines that govern the allocation of investment opportunities among the investment funds and accounts managed or sub-advised by Oaktree and its affiliates. To the extent an investment opportunity is appropriate for us or OCSI, OSI II or any other investment fund or account managed or sub-advised by Oaktree or its affiliates, Oaktree will adhere to its investment allocation guidelines in order to determine a fair and equitable allocation. 
We may invest alongside funds and accounts managed or sub-advised by our Adviser and its affiliates in certain circumstances where doing so is consistent with applicable law and SEC staff interpretations. For example, we may invest alongside such accounts consistent with guidance promulgated by the staff of the SEC permitting us and such other accounts to purchase interests in a single class of privately placed securities so long as certain conditions are met, including that our Adviser, acting on our behalf and on behalf of other clients, negotiates no term other than price or terms related to price. 
15

In addition, on October 18, 2017, our Adviser received exemptive relief from the SEC to allow certain managed funds and accounts, each of whose investment adviser is Oaktree or an investment adviser controlling, controlled by or under common control with Oaktree, to participate in negotiated co-investment transactions where doing so is consistent with the applicable registered fund’s or Business Development Company’s investment objective and strategies as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors, and pursuant to the conditions of the exemptive relief. Each potential co-investment opportunity that falls under the terms of the exemptive relief and is appropriate for us and any affiliated fund or account, and satisfies the then-current board-established criteria, will be offered to us and such other eligible funds and accounts. If there is a sufficient amount of securities to satisfy all participants, the securities will be allocated among the participants in accordance with their proposed order size and if there is an insufficient amount of securities to satisfy all participants, the securities will be allocated pro rata based on the investment proposed by the applicable investment adviser to such participant, up to the amount proposed to be invested by each, which is reviewed and approved by an independent committee of legal, compliance and accounting professionals at our Adviser. We may also invest alongside funds managed by our Adviser and its affiliates in certain circumstances where doing so is consistent with applicable law and SEC staff interpretations. For example, we may invest alongside such accounts consistent with guidance promulgated by the staff of the SEC permitting us and such other accounts to purchase interests in a single class of privately placed securities so long as certain conditions are met, including that our Adviser, acting on our behalf and on behalf of other clients, negotiates no term other than price.
Although Oaktree will endeavor to allocate investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner, we and our common stockholders could be adversely affected to the extent investment opportunities are allocated among us and other investment vehicles managed or sponsored by, or affiliated with, our executive officers, directors and members of our Adviser. We might not participate in each individual opportunity, but will, on an overall basis, be entitled to participate equitably with other entities managed by Oaktree and its affiliates. Oaktree is committed to treating all clients fairly and equitably over time such that none receive preferential treatment vis-à-vis the others over time, in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duty to each of them; however, in some instances, especially in instances of limited liquidity, the factors may not result in pro rata allocations or may result in situations where certain funds or accounts receive allocations where others do not.
Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, our Adviser’s liability is limited and we are required to indemnify our Adviser against certain liabilities. This may lead our Adviser to act in a riskier manner in performing its duties and obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement than it would if it were acting for its own account, and creates a potential conflict of interest.
Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, Oaktree Administrator furnishes us with the facilities, including our principal executive office, and administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. We pay Oaktree Administrator its allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by Oaktree Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including, without limitation, a portion of the rent at market rates and compensation of our Chief Financial Officer, Chief Compliance Officer, their respective staffs and other non-investment professionals at Oaktree that perform duties for us.
Election to be Taxed as a Regulated Investment Company
We have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally will not be required to pay corporate-level federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute to our stockholders as dividends. To continue to qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, to qualify for RIC tax treatment we must distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of the Company’s “investment company taxable income” for that year, which is generally its ordinary income plus the excess of its realized net short-term capital gains over its realized net long-term capital losses, or the Annual Distribution Requirement.
If we:

• | qualify as a RIC; and


• | satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement;

then we will not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of our investment company taxable income and net capital gain (i.e., realized net long-term capital gains in excess of realized net short-term capital losses) we distribute to stockholders. We are subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income or capital gain not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our stockholders.
16

We will be subject to a 4% nondeductible federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our ordinary income for each calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any income realized, but not distributed, and on which we paid no federal income tax, in preceding years. 
In order to maintain our qualification as a RIC for federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things:

• | at all times during each taxable year, have in effect an election to be treated as a Business Development Company under the Investment Company Act;


• | derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from (a) dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities (including loans), gains from the sale of stock or other securities or currencies, or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies and (b) net income derived from an interest in a “qualified publicly traded partnership;” (the “90% Gross Income Test”) and


• | diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year:


◦ | (i) at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of its assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and


◦ | (ii) no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in (a) the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer, (b) the securities of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable tax rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or (c) the securities of one or more “qualified publicly traded partnerships” ((i) and (ii) collectively, the “Diversification Tests”).

We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with increasing interest rates or debt instruments issued with warrants), we must include in income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. Because any original issue discount accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount.
Because we use debt financing, we are subject to certain asset coverage ratio requirements under the Investment Company Act described above and financial covenants under loan and credit agreements that could, under certain circumstances, restrict us from making distributions necessary to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement. If we are unable to obtain cash from other sources or are otherwise limited in our ability to make distributions, we could fail to qualify for RIC tax treatment and thus become subject to corporate-level income tax.
Certain of our investment practices may be subject to special and complex U.S. federal income tax provisions that may, among other things: (a) disallow, suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions; (b) convert lower taxed long-term capital gain into higher taxed short-term capital gain or ordinary income; (c) convert an ordinary loss or a deduction into a capital loss (the deductibility of which is more limited); (d) cause us to recognize income or gain without a corresponding receipt of cash; (e) adversely affect the time as to when a purchase or sale of securities is deemed to occur; (f) adversely alter the characterization of certain complex financial transactions; or (g) produce income that will not be qualifying income for purposes of the 90% gross income test described above. We will monitor our transactions and may make certain tax elections in order to mitigate the potential adverse effect of these provisions.
If, in any particular taxable year, we do not qualify as a RIC, all of our taxable income (including our net capital gains) will be subject to tax at regular corporate rates without any deduction for distributions to stockholders, and distributions will be taxable to the stockholders as ordinary dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits.
Business Development Company Regulations
We have elected to be a Business Development Company under the Investment Company Act. As with other companies regulated by the Investment Company Act, a Business Development Company must adhere to certain substantive regulatory requirements. The Investment Company Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between Business Development Companies and their affiliates (including any investment advisers), principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters. 
17

The Investment Company Act further requires that a majority of our directors be persons other than “interested persons,” as that term is defined in the Investment Company Act. In addition, we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a Business Development Company unless authorized by a vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities, as required by the Investment Company Act. A majority of the outstanding voting securities of a company is defined under the Investment Company Act as the lesser of: (a) 67% or more of such company’s voting securities present at a meeting if more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company are present or represented by proxy, or (b) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company. We do not anticipate any substantial change in the nature of our business.
We are not generally able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. We may, however, sell our common stock, warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the current net asset value of the common stock if our Board of Directors determines that such sale is in our best interests and that of our stockholders, and our stockholders approve such sale. In any such case, the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price which, in the determination of our Board of Directors, closely approximates the market value of such securities (less any distributing commission or discount). We may also make rights offerings to our stockholders at prices per share less than the net asset value per share, subject to applicable requirements of the Investment Company Act. 
Investment Restrictions
We do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the Investment Company Act. Under such limits, except for registered money market funds, we generally cannot acquire more than 3% of the voting stock of any registered investment company, invest more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one registered investment company or invest more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of registered investment companies in the aggregate. The portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies ordinarily will subject stockholders to additional indirect expenses. None of the policies described above is fundamental and each such policy may be changed without stockholder approval, subject to any limitations imposed by the Investment Company Act. 
Qualifying Assets
Under the Investment Company Act, a Business Development Company may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the Investment Company Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the company’s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are any of the following:
(1) Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the Investment Company Act as any issuer which:
(a) is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States;
(b) is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the Business Development Company) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the Investment Company Act; and
(c) satisfies any of the following:
(i) does not have any class of securities that is traded on a national securities exchange;
(ii) has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, but has an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and non-voting common equity of less than $250 million;
(iii) is controlled by a Business Development Company or a group of companies including a Business Development Company and the Business Development Company has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company; or
(iv) is a small and solvent company having total assets of not more than $4 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2 million;
(2) Securities of any eligible portfolio company that we control;
(3) Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if 
18

the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements;
(4) Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company;
(5) Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities; or
(6) Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment.
Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies
A Business Development Company must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in (1), (2) or (3) above. However, in order to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for the purpose of the 70% test, a Business Development Company must either control the issuer of the securities or must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities (other than small and solvent companies described above) significant managerial assistance. However, when a Business Development Company purchases securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group may make available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance includes any arrangement whereby a Business Development Company, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company.
Temporary Investments
Pending investment in other types of "qualifying assets," as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment (collectively, “temporary investments”) so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. We may also invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as the Company, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our gross assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the Diversification Tests. Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. Our Adviser will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions.
Senior Securities
At a special meeting of stockholders held on June 28, 2019, our stockholders approved the application of the reduced asset coverage requirements in Section 61(a)(2) of the Investment Company Act to us, effective as of June 29, 2019. The reduced asset coverage requirements permit us to double the maximum amount of leverage that we are permitted to incur by reducing the asset coverage requirements applicable to us from 200% to 150%. As a result of the reduced asset coverage requirement, we can incur $2 of debt for each $1 of equity as compared to $1 of debt for each $1 of equity. 
Consistent with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, we are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as calculated as provided in the Investment Company Act, is at least 150% immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we may make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We would also be permitted to borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for generally up to 60 days for temporary purposes without regard to asset coverage.
Other
We are subject to periodic examination by the SEC for compliance with the Investment Company Act.
We are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a Business Development Company, we are prohibited from protecting any director 
19

or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s office.
We and our Adviser will each be required to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the U.S. federal securities laws, review these policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation, and designate a Chief Compliance Officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures.
Code of Ethics
We have adopted a joint code of ethics with OCSI pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act and we have also approved Oaktree’s code of ethics that was adopted by it under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act and Rule 204A-1 under the Advisers Act. These codes establish procedures for personal investments and restrict certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to the code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code’s requirements. You may read and copy the codes of ethics at the SEC’s Public Reference Room located at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. In addition, the codes of ethics are available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and are available at the Investors: Corporate Governance portion of our website at www.oaktreespecialtylending.com.
Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to our Adviser. The proxy voting policies and procedures of our Adviser are set forth below. These guidelines are reviewed periodically by our Adviser and our independent directors, and, accordingly, are subject to change.
An investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of its clients. As part of this duty, our Adviser recognizes that it must vote portfolio securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in the best interests of its clients. 
These policies and procedures for voting proxies are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act. 
Our Adviser will vote proxies relating to our portfolio securities, if any, in what it perceives to be the best interest of our stockholders. Our Adviser will review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a shareholder vote to determine its impact on portfolio securities held by us. Although our Adviser will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative impact on our portfolio securities, it may vote for such a proposal if there are compelling long-term reasons to do so. 
Our Adviser’s proxy voting decisions will be made by officers who are responsible for monitoring each of our investments. To ensure that the vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, our Adviser will require that: (1) anyone involved in the decision-making process disclose to the Chief Compliance Officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (2) employees involved in the decision-making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how our Adviser intends to vote on a proposal, in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties.
Stockholders may obtain information regarding how we voted proxies by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Oaktree Specialty Lending Corporation, Chief Compliance Officer, 333 South Grand Avenue 28th Floor, Los Angeles, CA 90071.
Reporting Obligations 
We file annual reports containing audited financial statements, quarterly reports, and such other periodic reports as we determine to be appropriate or as may be required by law. We are required to comply with all periodic reporting, proxy solicitation and other applicable requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act.
We make available on or through our website certain reports and amendments to those reports that we file with or furnish to the SEC in accordance with the Exchange Act. These include our annual reports on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our current reports on Form 8-K. We make this information available on our website free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file the information with, or furnish it to, the SEC. The SEC also maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information we file with the SEC at www.sec.gov.
20

We maintain a website at www.oaktreespecialtylending.com. The information on our website is not incorporated by reference in this annual report on Form 10-K.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act Compliance
We are subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the Exchange Act, including the filing of quarterly, annual and current reports, proxy statements and other required items. In addition, we are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on public companies and their insiders. For example:

• | pursuant to Rule 13a-14 under the Exchange Act, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer are required to certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports;


• | pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K, our periodic reports are required to disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures; and


• | pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our management is required to prepare a report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm is required to audit our internal control over financial reporting.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. We will continue to monitor compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith. 
Stock Exchange Corporate Governance Regulations
Each of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC and the New York Stock Exchange has adopted corporate governance regulations that listed companies must comply with. We are in compliance with such corporate governance regulations as applicable to us.
