ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
GENERAL
 The first BJ’s restaurant, which opened in 1978 in Orange County, California, was a small sit down pizzeria that featured Chicago style deep-dish pizza with a unique California twist. Our goal then and still today, is to be the best casual dining concept ever by focusing on high quality menu options, at a compelling value, a dining experience that exceeds customers’ expectations for service, hospitality and enjoyment, and an atmosphere that is always welcoming and approachable. 
 In 1996, we introduced our initial proprietary craft beers and expanded the BJ’s concept from its beginnings as a small pizzeria to a full-service, high energy casual dining restaurant when we opened our first large format restaurant featuring a brewing operations in Brea, California. Today our restaurants feature over 140 menu offerings including: slow roasted entrees, such as, prime rib; EnLIGHTened Entrees® such as our Cherry Chipotle Glazed Salmon; our original signature deep-dish pizza; the often imitated, but never replicated world-famous Pizookie® dessert; and our award-winning BJ’s proprietary craft beers. As of February 25, 2019, we own and operate 202 restaurants located in 27 states, and our proprietary craft beer is produced at several of our locations, our Temple, Texas brewpub locations and by independent third party brewers using our proprietary recipes.

Electronic copies of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K are available, free of charge, by visiting the "Investor Relations" section of our website. These reports are posted as soon as practical after they are electronically filed with the SEC. We caution that the information on our website is not part of this or any other reports we file with, or furnish to, the SEC.
 BUSINESS STRATEGY
 We compete in the casual dining segment of the restaurant industry, which is a large, highly fragmented segment with estimated annual sales in the $100+ billion range. We believe that the BJ’s restaurant concept offers consumers a higher quality, more contemporary and approachable “casual plus,” “premium casual,” or “polished casual” dining experience than the more mature, mass market casual dining concepts. Accordingly, our primary business objective is to continue taking market share in the casual dining restaurant industry by delivering on our “Gold Standard of Operational Excellence” promise to our customers while continuing our new restaurant national expansion program. Our Gold Standard of Operational Excellence is our genuine commitment to take pride in passionately connecting with every customer on every visit, through flawless and relentless execution of every detail, during every shift – to create and keep fanatical fans of BJ’s. We believe that by delivering upon this commitment to our customers, we create the best opportunity to generate significant repeat business and capture additional market share in the casual dining segment of the restaurant industry. 
 Our Gold Standard of Operational Excellence is focused on the following key areas that help to differentiate BJ’s from other casual dining restaurants:
  
• | Feature a Broad and Distinctive Menu – Over the years we have expanded the BJ’s concept to include menu options that meet our customers’ preferences for any dining occasion. Our menu items are created by our talented culinary team and prepared to order in our restaurants using fresh high-quality ingredients. Our broad menu is an important factor in our differentiation from other casual dining competitors. We evaluate our menu offerings and prices two to three times a year in addition to offering seasonal or limited time only menu items throughout the year. Building on our early pizza legacy, we now offer almost 20 signature flavors of pizza and made-to-order combinations in tavern-cut to deep-dish styles. Our hand-pressed deep-dish pizza dough is double proofed – which means it rises twice – which elevates its presentation and taste. In 2018, we began to slow cook large format proteins including prime rib,

turkey and pork, which continued to grow in popularity throughout the year. Our slow roast Prime Rib Special and our Double Bone-in Pork Chop are signature menu items for BJ’s that showcase our higher quality, differentiated positioning. By continually innovating our slow roast offerings, we provide our customers with unique and craveable menu items they can only get at BJ’s. Our menu differentiation also includes our successful EnLIGHTened Entrees® category which features “better for you" selections of lower-calorie, “super” foods, vegetarian and gluten-free options.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Offer Award Winning, Proprietary Craft Beer – All of our restaurants feature our award-winning, proprietary craft beers, which we believe showcase the quality and care of the ingredients we use at BJ’s. Our high-quality, craft beers further differentiate BJ’s from many other restaurant concepts and complement our signature deep-dish pizza and other menu items. Our beers have earned over 180 medals at different beer festivals and events, including 35 medals at the Great American Beer Festival and 11 medals at the World Beer Cup. We also offer approximately 30 domestic, imported and “guest” craft beers on tap, in addition to a selection of bottled beers in our restaurants. Additionally, we offer our craft beer for take-out at select restaurant locations and for sale at select retailers. Our large and unique beer offering is intended to enhance BJ’s competitive positioning as a leading retailer of beer in the casual dining segment of the restaurant industry.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Provide an Everyday Value Proposition – We strive to offer great everyday value throughout our menu, with diverse price points and unique flavor profiles. Our menu entrées, excluding our promotional specials, generally range in price from $7.25 to $26.50 and our average per-customer check during fiscal 2018, including beverages, was approximately $16.00, compared to the mass market casual dining concepts that have average customer checks of $13.00 to $19.00. To reinforce and highlight our everyday value proposition, our Daily Brewhouse Specials feature iconic food and drink combinations Monday through Thursday and are a key driver of improving customer traffic and loyalty. Our happy hour offerings and lunch specials have further enhanced our strong value equation.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A Culture Committed to Service and Hospitality – Great dining experiences start with great people. We have invested carefully to make sure we recruit, select, train and retain employees that can take care of our customers and operate our large and complex restaurants. In addition to hiring great employees, we have invested in productivity and hospitality systems to enhance our ability to deliver the Gold Standard of Operational Excellence that we promise our customers. These systems include a Net Promoter Scoring system that evaluates several key elements of our service including pace, hospitality, value and recommend scores, as well as mystery shopper and customer loyalty programs. Our restaurant teams execute at a high level and treat every customer as if they were family, which drove higher Net Promoter Scores in 2018.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Optimize our Customers’’ Time – Time is a finite resource for our customers, and we believe that by being attentive to every detail, we can optimize our customers’ enjoyment when they choose to dine in our restaurants. We introduced hand-held ordering tablets to our servers in 2017, which have helped to improve our pace and productivity, including reducing the time it takes to deliver the first drink or food item to our customers. The tablets have resulted in an improved customer experience and driven higher incident rates for beverages, appetizers and desserts.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Making the BJ’s Menu Available Off-Premise – Consumer preferences continue to evolve as e-commerce, mobile shopping and “food-on-demand” to any location continue to gain traction and divert visitation away from traditional brick and mortar shopping locations. To meet these new preferences we have invested in the off-premise channel and continue to grow our capabilities to address this opportunity. We offer specialized large-party and catering menus and collaborate with several third-party delivery partners to provide delivery service from our restaurants. We also leverage our self-developed mobile app, our website and other platforms to ensure our customers can easily enjoy BJ’s menu off-premise.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | High Energy Atmosphere and Facilities – As part of our competitive positioning as a polished casual dining concept, our restaurants have finishes consistent with more upscale casual dining concepts. All of our restaurants feature high ceilings and have a signature bar statement with large flat screen televisions that can be viewed from any seat. Additionally, we use a variety of higher quality customer touchpoints, including distinctive glassware to fit the beer or beverage style and linen napkins not generally found in casual dining. We believe our large restaurants with a signature bar statement provide our customers with a higher energy dining experience.

RESTAURANT OPERATIONS 
 Based on internal and publicly available data, we believe that our restaurants, on average, generate relatively high customer traffic per square foot compared to many other casual dining concepts. We have implemented operational systems and 
 4


procedures to support our desire to run our restaurants “quality fast,” particularly at peak dining periods, in order to effectively and efficiently serve every customer. The typical management team for a BJ’s restaurant consists of a General Manager, an Executive Kitchen Manager and three to five other managers depending on the sales volume of each restaurant. The General Manager is responsible for the day-to-day operations of their restaurant, including hiring, training, and the development of personnel, as well as for sales and operating profit. The Executive Kitchen Manager is responsible for managing food quality and preparation, purchasing, inventories and kitchen labor costs. 
 New restaurant managers are required to successfully complete an 11-week comprehensive advanced management training program dedicated to all aspects of the operation of our restaurants including both restaurateuring and restaurant business-related topics. Our restaurant management training program is directed by our Vice President of Operations Talent Development and is closely monitored by our field supervision team. 
 The General Manager of each restaurant reports to a Director of Operations or an Area Vice President, who reports to a Senior Vice President of Operations or a Vice President of Operations. Additionally, we have Directors of Kitchen Operations who oversee the food quality and safety, kitchen efficiency and consistency in our restaurants and help educate, coach and develop our kitchen managers. Our Directors of Kitchen Operations report to our Senior Vice President of Culinary and Kitchen Innovation. Our Senior and Vice Presidents of Operations report to our Executive Vice President of Operations who oversees all aspects of restaurant operations including kitchen and bar operations, restaurant facility management, new restaurant openings and the roll-out of key operational initiatives. 
 Each of our restaurants typically employs an average of approximately 110 hourly employees, many of whom work part-time. Our goal is to staff our restaurants with qualified, trained and enthusiastic employees who desire to be an integral part of BJ’s fun, premium casual atmosphere and, at the same time, have the passion, intensity, work ethic and ability to execute our concept correctly and consistently on every shift. In January 2019, we were awarded one of the 2019 Best Practices Awards by TDn2K™ (Transforming Data into Knowledge), the parent company of People Report™, Black Box Intelligence™ and White Box Social Intelligence™. These awards honor restaurant organizations for workplace excellence in their specific segment of the restaurant industry and for setting the standard for overall best-in-class business performance. The Diamond Catalyst Award we received was a tribute to our superior operational and workplace results.
 In order to maintain our high standards, all new restaurant hourly employees undergo formal training from certified Employee Instructors at each restaurant. Our restaurant hours of operations are generally from 11:00 a.m. to 12:00 a.m. Sunday through Thursday and 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 a.m. Friday and Saturday. Our restaurants are typically open every day of the year except for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Most of our restaurants currently offer either in-house and/or third party delivery service. Additionally, all of our restaurants offer a call-ahead or online wait list, on-line ordering for dine-in or customer pick-up and reservations for large parties. 
 RESTAURANT SITE SELECTION AND EXPANSION OBJECTIVES 
 Our current restaurant format is expected to represent the vast majority of our planned new restaurant growth for the foreseeable future. We may also open new brewpub locations (“brewing restaurants”) to maintain our beer supply as we open more restaurants or where on-site brewing is the only legally permissible way to offer our proprietary craft beer in a particular state. 
 We seek to secure high-quality, high-profile locations for our “casual plus” restaurants, which we believe have the ability to draw customers from a larger area than most “mass market” casual dining chain restaurants. Since BJ’s has proven that it can be successful in a variety of locations (urban or suburban shopping areas, retail strip centers, lifestyle centers, and entertainment centers – either freestanding or in-line) and in a variety of income demographics, we can be highly selective and flexible in choosing suitable locations. We prefer to open our restaurants at high-profile sites in mature trade areas with dense populations. We generally target geographic regions that allow us to build multiple restaurants in those areas. This “clustering” approach provides economic benefits including lower supply and distribution costs, improved marketing efficiencies, management supervision leverage and increased brand awareness. 
 During fiscal 2018, we opened five new restaurants and increased our overall total restaurant operating weeks by approximately 4% during the year. During fiscal 2019, we expect to open seven to nine new restaurants. Based on information currently available, we expect to open four restaurants during the first half of fiscal 2019, and the remaining restaurants during the second half of the year. 
 We typically enter into operating leases for our locations for periods ranging from 10 to 20 years and we obtain lease extension options in most instances. Our lease payment terms vary from lease to lease, but generally provide for the payment of both minimum base rent and contingent (percentage) rent based on restaurant sales. We may also purchase the land underlying certain restaurant locations if it becomes available. However, it is not our current strategy to own a large number of land 
 5


parcels that underlie our restaurants. In many cases, we subsequently enter into sale-leaseback arrangements for land parcels that we purchase.
 TARGETED NEW RESTAURANT ECONOMICS 
 Our current restaurant prototypes average approximately 7,500 square feet with seating for as many as 250 customers with a targeted gross construction cost of approximately $4.0 million to $5.0 million, some of which may be reimbursed to us by our landlords in the form of tenant improvement allowance incentives. All potential restaurant locations may not have a tenant improvement allowance available and such allowances, when available, will vary in amount. In selecting sites for our restaurants, an important objective is to earn a suitable rate of return on our investment. However, this return often cannot be meaningfully measured until our restaurants reach their mature sales and profitability levels. Maturation periods vary from restaurant to restaurant, but generally range from two to five years. We currently target a blended 25% return on our net cash invested to build a new restaurant, and a blended 20% return on total capital invested, which includes our net cash invested and a factor for the landlord’s invested capital (based on a capitalized value of minimum rents to be paid to the landlord) for each group of new restaurants to be opened each year, measured once the restaurants reach their mature level of operations. 
 The return-on-investment targets for our restaurant operations do not include any allocation of opening costs, field supervision and corporate support expense, non-cash items such as depreciation, amortization, equity-related compensation expense, and income taxes, and do not represent a targeted return on our common stock. There can be no assurance that any new restaurant opened will have similar operating results to those of established restaurants and actual results will usually differ from targeted results and differences may be material. We generally target our new restaurants to achieve average annual sales at maturity of $4.5 million to $5.5 million, and we generally target an average “four wall” estimated operating cash flow margin in the range of 17% to 20% at maturity, after all occupancy expenses. 
 It is common in the casual dining industry for many new locations to initially open with sales volumes well in excess of their sustainable run-rate levels. This initial “honeymoon” sales period may take up to five years until a new restaurant’s sales eventually settle at a more predictable and sustainable level. Additionally, all of our new restaurants usually require several months or longer after opening to reach their targeted restaurant-level operating margin due to cost of sales and labor inefficiencies commonly associated with more complex casual dining restaurants. 
 RESTAURANT OPENING EXPENSES 
 Restaurant opening expenses (also referred to as “preopening” expenses) include incremental out-of-pocket costs that are directly related to the openings of new restaurants that may not be capitalized. As a result of the more complex operational nature of our “casual plus” restaurant concept compared to that of a typical casual dining chain restaurant, the preopening process for our new restaurants is more extensive, time consuming and costly. The preopening expense for one of our restaurants usually includes costs to compensate an average of six to eight restaurant management employees prior to opening; costs to recruit and train an average of 150 hourly restaurant employees; wages, travel and lodging costs for our opening training team and other support employees; costs to practice service activities; and straight-line minimum base rent during the construction and in-restaurant training period. 
 Our preopening expense averaged approximately $0.4 million per new restaurant in fiscal 2018. We usually incur the most significant portion of direct preopening costs within the two-month period immediately preceding and during the month of a restaurant’s opening. Preopening costs can fluctuate significantly from period to period, based on the number and timing of restaurant openings and the specific preopening costs incurred for each restaurant. We expense preopening costs as incurred in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”).
 BREWING OPERATIONS 
 Sales of our proprietary craft beers represented approximately 6% of our total restaurant sales during fiscal 2018. In substantially all of our restaurants we also offer a wide selection of other popular craft beers on tap. Accordingly, total sales of beer represented approximately 10% of our total restaurant sales during fiscal 2018. 
 Our internal brewing operations originated in 1996 with the opening of the first large format location in Brea, California, which included our first on-site brewing operation. We currently have five restaurants with brewpub operations and two other brewpub locations around the country. We also utilize qualified independent third party brewers to produce our beer, using our proprietary recipes. Additionally, our on-site and independent third party brewing operations analyze each batch of BJ’s branded beer in internal laboratories and periodically send samples to an independent laboratory for quality control testing purposes. In fiscal 2018, our five restaurants with brewpub operations and two brewpub locations produced approximately 26,000 barrels of BJ’s branded beer, and independent third party brewers produced approximately 31,500 barrels of BJ’s 
 6


branded beer. Our brewing operations are typically staffed with a head brewer and an assistant brewer, who report to a brewing director. Production planning and quality control are monitored by our corporate brewing operations department which is led by our Senior Vice President of Brewing Operations. 
 We currently believe that a combination of internal brewing and larger-scale independent third party brewing represents the optimal production method for our craft beers as we continue the national expansion of our restaurants. This approach allows us to get the benefits provided by brewing beer in larger batches, yet also provides us the flexibility to allow our brewing operations to focus on specialty, seasonal and research and development beers. We estimate our total proprietary craft beer requirement to be approximately 62,000 barrels for fiscal 2019, with approximately 53% of that requirement expected to be produced by independent third party brewers. 
 We also produce our proprietary non-alcoholic craft sodas that are sold in our restaurants. Our craft sodas include root beer, ginger beer, cream, orange and black cherry soda. 
 MARKETING AND ADVERTISING 
 We believe that the most effective method, over the long run, to protect and enhance our customer visit frequency is to spend our marketing dollars on the plate and provide better food quality, service and facilities for our customers. However, due to sluggish retail sales growth coupled with the maturation of the casual dining segment of the restaurant industry, we have been prudently increasing our marketing expenditures to improve awareness and brand equity in the markets where we operate. Our marketing spend generally takes the form of limited television for those markets in which we have enough restaurant penetration as well as print, radio, digital and social media programs. We also utilize our loyalty program, BJ’s Premier Rewards Plus®, to engage with our customers and monitor their frequency and purchasing behavior.
 Our marketing related expenditures were approximately 2.2%, 2.0%, and 1.9% of revenues for fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. We expect our marketing expenditures in 2019 to continue to be between 2% to 3% of our revenues. However, depending on the current operating conditions for casual dining restaurants, we may decide to increase or decrease our marketing expenditures beyond our current expectations. 
 CHARITABLE ACTIVITIES 
 At BJ’s we believe it is important to give back to the communities we serve and to do more good things for more people. In fiscal 2006, we started the BJ’s Restaurants Foundation (the “Foundation”), a 501(c)(3) qualified non-profit charitable organization, is principally dedicated to supporting charities benefiting children’s healthcare and education, with a primary focus on the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (“CFF”). Our Chairman of the Board of Directors and four of our current executive officers currently serve on the Foundation’s seven-person Board of Directors. Our commitment to supporting humanitarian causes is exemplified by our “Cookies for Kids” program, which was created in 1998 and continues to be the heart of BJ’s continued financial support of CFF, to which millions of dollars have been donated throughout the years. In addition, we arrange for the collection and donation of other funds to CFF through our restaurant preopening training programs. These programs, combined with other programs administered by the Foundation, resulted in the donation of approximately $0.4 million to CFF during each of the last three fiscal years.
 We also focus on supporting our local communities by providing food and other resources for many worthwhile charitable causes and events through a program called Team Action to Support Communities (“TASC Force”). The TASC Force program recognizes and supports the volunteer efforts of our restaurant employees across the country as they help to give back to the communities in which our restaurants do business. Our restaurant employees volunteer to support community events such as helping to paint a house for needy seniors, assisting in community clean-up campaigns, working at community blood drives, helping with Special Olympics programs, building houses with Habitat for Humanity, supporting local food banks, or volunteering at marathons and other charitable fundraisers. Our TASC Force program has been honored and recognized twice as the recipient of the California Restaurant Association’s Restaurant Neighbor Award, the most community-minded large restaurant chain in the state. We have also received the prestigious Restaurant Neighbor Award in the large business category from the National Restaurant Association.
 INFORMATION SYSTEMS 
 We believe it is extremely important to provide our operators with state of the art, secure technology so that they can better serve our customers and our employees in a productive and efficient manner. These technologies include an automated kitchen display system (“KDS”) and bar display system (“BDS”), a web-based labor scheduling and productivity analyzer system, a theoretical food cost system, an automated front desk table management system and handheld server tablets. Each of these systems is integrated into our Point of Sale (“POS”) system which is used to record sales transactions, send menu orders to our 
 7


kitchen, batch and transmit credit card transactions, record employee time clock information and produce a variety of management reports. Our KDS is an automated routing and cooking station balancing system which improves cooking station productivity, synchronizes order completion, provides valuable ticket time and cooking time data, and allows for more efficient levels of labor without sacrificing quality. Our BDS is an automated routing and beverage station balancing system which improves beverage station productivity by further leveraging our automation capability. Additionally, our web-based labor scheduling and productivity analyzer automates aspects of the labor scheduling for the managers and employees and produces a number of real-time key performance indicators and productivity reports for our management team, including controls and alerts to assist in complying with federal, state and local labor laws. Our theoretical food cost system and automated food prep system allow us to better measure product yields in our kitchens and help reduce kitchen errors and eliminate excessive waste. Our automated front desk table management system helps us to better optimize the overall seating efficiencies and “table turns” in our restaurants. We also utilize a centralized accounting and human resources system that collects data from our restaurants in order to produce operational and scorecard reporting as well as a data center technology services with cloud based technologies to provide scalability and bursting capabilities which support growth and enable rapid technology deployments. Our electronic human resources workflow solution streamlines and expedites the process of onboarding new employees, while insuring accuracy and facilitating the collection of richer data. In 2019, we will be implementing a new human capital management system, which we expect to further enhance and improve our current capabilities. Our tablet-based inventory technology streamlines our inventory counting process while insuring accuracy. Our BJ’s mobile application, which allows our customers to use their smartphones to order ahead, add their name to our waitlist, pay at the table and manage their loyalty account, among other things, has been well received by our customers. We will continue to develop restaurant and support technologies that help improve the customer experience, employee effectiveness and satisfaction, financial management and cost control. All new technology is thoroughly tested before any company-wide rollout is implemented.
 SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT 
 Our supply chain department, working together with our culinary, marketing and operations teams, is responsible for the selection and procurement of all of the food ingredients, beverages, products and supplies for our restaurants and brewing operations. Specifications are mandated by the supply chain department in order to consistently maintain the highest quality ingredients and operational materials. Our goal is to obtain the highest quality menu ingredients, products and supplies from reliable sources at competitive prices. In order to maximize operating efficiencies between the purchase and usage, each restaurant’s Executive Kitchen Manager determines daily usage requirements for food ingredients, products and supplies for their restaurant and places all orders with vendors approved by our supply chain department. Our Executive Kitchen Managers also inspect our deliveries to ensure that the items received meet our quality specifications and negotiated prices. For many of our menu ingredients, we have arranged for acceptable alternative manufacturers, vendors, growers and shippers in order to reduce risk in our supply chain. In addition to procuring food ingredients, beverages, products and supplies for our restaurants and brewing operations, the supply chain department also manages the procurement agreements in the areas of energy, transportation and general corporate services.
 Where economically feasible and possible, we attempt to negotiate contracts for key commodities used in the preparation of our food and beverage offerings, based on our expected requirements for each fiscal year. If our attempts are successful, most of our contracts typically range in duration from three to twelve months. Although we currently do not directly engage in future contracts or other financial risk management strategies with respect to potential commodity cost fluctuations, from time to time we may opportunistically request that our suppliers consider doing so to help minimize the impact of potential cost fluctuations. Suppliers will typically pass the cost of such strategies along to us, either directly or indirectly.
 We use Distribution Market Advantage (“DMA”), a consortium of large, regional food distributors located throughout the United States to deliver the majority of our food products to our restaurants. In July 2017, after conducting a market evaluation, we entered into a new five-year agreement with DMA. The new agreement expires in June 2022. Jacmar Foodservice Distribution is a member of DMA and is the primary distributor of food and operating supplies for our California and Nevada restaurants. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding this related party. We have a non-exclusive contract with DMA on terms and conditions that we believe are consistent with those made available to similarly situated restaurant companies. 
 We have an agreement with the largest nationwide foodservice distributor of fresh produce in the United States to service most of our restaurants and, where licensed, to distribute our proprietary craft beer to our restaurants. This distributor currently delivers our proprietary craft beer to approximately 50% of our restaurants. 
 COMPETITION
 The domestic restaurant industry is highly competitive and generally considered to be mature. There are a substantial number of casual dining, fast casual and quick service restaurant chains and other food and beverage service operations, that compete 
 8


both directly and indirectly with us in every respect, including food quality and service, the price‑value relationship, beer quality and selection, atmosphere, suitable sites for new restaurants and for qualified personnel to operate our restaurants, among other factors. We also compete within each of our trade areas with locally-owned restaurants. We face growing competition as a result of the trend toward convergence in grocery, deli and restaurant services, particularly in the supermarket industry which offers “convenient meals” in the form of improved entrées and side dishes.
 Our restaurant concept is a relatively small “varied menu” casual dining competitor when compared to the mature “mass market” chains, with 63 of our restaurants currently located in one state - California. Our overall brand awareness and competitive presence in states outside of California is not as significant as that of our major casual dining chain competitors. Many competitors with similar concepts to ours have been in business longer than we have, have greater consumer awareness, and often have substantially greater capital, marketing and human resources. 
 We believe, however, that our ability to offer higher quality food and beverages at moderate prices with superior service in a distinctive dining environment provides us with the opportunity to capture additional market share in the casual dining segment.
 FOOD QUALITY AND SAFETY 
 Our revenues can be substantially affected by adverse publicity resulting from food quality, illness, or health concerns stemming from incidents occurring at our restaurants as well as incidents that may occur at our competitors’ restaurants. In addition, our revenues can be affected by illness or health concerns stemming from incidents occurring at our suppliers or competing suppliers. We attempt to manage risks of this nature by leveraging food quality and safety controls throughout our supply chain and internal training programs. While we believe that our internal policies and procedures for food safety and sanitation are thorough, the risk of food-borne illness cannot be completely eliminated, and incidents at other restaurant chains or in the food supply chain may affect our restaurants even if our restaurants are not implicated in a food safety concern.
 We are committed to serving safe, high quality food. Our food quality and safety teams strive to ensure compliance with our food safety programs and practices, components of which include:
  
• | Partnering with suppliers to improve food safety processes and technology
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Food safety training for all new employees
--+-------------------------------------------


• | Advanced food safety training for management trainees
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | Manager food safety certifications
--+-----------------------------------


• | Several layers of audits and inspections:
--+------------------------------------------


o | 12 unannounced audits per year by an independent third party auditing company
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | BJ’s internal Quality Assurance team audits
--+--------------------------------------------


o | Operation’s team food safety audits
--+------------------------------------


o | Regulatory inspections
--+-----------------------


• | Daily food safety checks based on Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (“HACCP”) principles
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Utilization of technology to manage food safety risks
--+------------------------------------------------------

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
 James Dal Pozzo, the Chairman of the Board of the Jacmar Companies (“Jacmar”), is a member of our Board of Directors. Jacmar, through its affiliation with DMA, a consortium of large, regional food distributors located throughout the United States, is currently our largest distributor of food, beverage, paper products and supplies. In 2006, we began using DMA to deliver the majority of our food products to our restaurants. In July 2017, after conducting a market evaluation, we entered into a new five-year agreement with DMA. The new agreement expires in June 2022. Jacmar services our restaurants in California and Nevada, while other DMA distributors service our restaurants in all other states. Under the terms of our agreement with DMA, Jacmar is required to sell products to us at the same prices as the other DMA distributors. Jacmar does not provide us with any produce, liquor, wine or beer products, all of which are provided by other third party vendors and are included in “Cost of sales” on our Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on related party transactions.
GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS 
 We are subject to various federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations that affect our business. Each of our restaurants is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, which may include alcoholic beverage control, labor/equal employment, building, land use, health, safety and fire agencies, and environmental regulations in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located. Difficulties obtaining or maintaining the required licenses or approvals could 
 9


delay or prevent the development of a new restaurant in a particular area or could adversely affect the operation of an existing restaurant. We believe, however, that we are in compliance in all material respects with all relevant laws, rules, and regulations. We have never experienced abnormal difficulties or delays in obtaining the licenses or approvals required to open a new restaurant or in continuing the operation of an existing restaurant. 
 Alcoholic beverage control regulations require each of our restaurants to apply to a federal and state authority and, in certain locations, municipal authorities for a license and permit to sell alcoholic beverages on and off premises. Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause by such authority at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations impact numerous aspects of the daily operations of our restaurants, including the minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling, and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. 
 Our restaurants and brewing operations are subject to “tied house” laws and the “three tier system” of beverage alcohol distribution, which were introduced by various states after the repeal of Prohibition. These laws generally prohibit brewers from holding an interest in retail licenses and require manufacturers, distributors and retailers to remain separate “tiers.” Over the last 25 years, “brewpubs,” which are both retailers and onsite brewers, have been authorized by law in most states through specific exceptions to these laws. These exceptions are unique to each state and do not mirror one another. However, brewpubs are generally licensed as retailers and do not have the same privileges as microbreweries, and the privileges of, and restrictions imposed on, brewpubs vary from state to state. These restrictions sometimes prevent us from operating both brewpubs and restaurants in some states. We believe that we are currently in compliance with the brewpub regulations in the states where we hold such licenses. However, there is some risk that a state’s brewpub regulations or the interpretation of these regulations may change in a way that could impact our current model of brewing beer and/or supplying beer to our restaurants in that state. We apply for our alcoholic beverage licenses with the advice of outside legal and licensing counsel and consultants. Even after the issuance of these licenses, our operations could be subject to differing interpretations of the “tied house” laws and the requirements of the “three tier system” of beverage alcohol distribution in any jurisdiction that we conduct business. Additionally, the failure to receive or retain, or a delay in obtaining, a liquor license in a particular location could adversely affect our ability to obtain such a license elsewhere. 
 We are subject to “dram-shop” statutes in California and other states in which we operate. Those statutes generally provide a person who has been injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that has wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to such person. We carry liquor liability coverage, as part of our existing comprehensive general liability insurance, which we believe is consistent with the coverage carried by other entities in the restaurant industry and would help protect us from exposure created by possible claims. Even though we carry liquor liability insurance, a judgment against us under a dram-shop statute in excess of our liability coverage could have a materially adverse effect on us. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are liable, claims may also be expensive to defend and may divert management’s time and our financial resources away from our operations. We may also be adversely affected by publicity resulting from such claims.
 Various federal and state labor laws, along with rules and regulations, govern our relationship with our employees, including such matters as minimum wage, overtime, tip credits, health insurance, working conditions, safety and work eligibility requirements. Significant additional governmental mandates, such as an increased minimum wage, a change in the laws governing exempt employees, an increase in paid time off or leaves of absence, mandates on health benefits and insurance or increased tax reporting and payment requirements for employees who receive gratuities, could negatively impact our restaurants’ profitability. We are also subject to the regulations of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) branch of the United States Department of Homeland Security. In addition, some states in which we operate have adopted immigration employment protection laws. Even if we operate our restaurants in strict compliance with ICE and state requirements, some of our employees may not meet federal work eligibility or residency requirements, despite our efforts and without our knowledge, which could lead to a disruption in our work force. Additionally, our suppliers may also be affected by various federal and state labor laws which could result in supply disruptions for our various goods and services or higher costs for goods and services supplied to us.
 We are also subject to various laws and proposals regarding regulations relating to nutritional content, nutritional labeling, product safety and menu labeling. 
 We are subject to federal and state environmental regulations. Various laws concerning the handling, storage, and disposal of hazardous materials, such as cleaning solvents, and the operation of restaurants and brewpubs in environmentally sensitive locations may impact aspects of our operations. 
 Our facilities must comply with the applicable requirements of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”) and related state statutes. The ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability with respect to public accommodations and employment. Under the ADA and related state laws, when constructing new restaurants or undertaking significant remodeling 
 10


of existing restaurants, we must make them readily accessible to disabled persons. We must also make reasonable accommodations for the employment of disabled persons.
 We have a significant number of hourly restaurant employees who receive income from gratuities. We have elected to voluntarily participate in a Tip Reporting Alternative Commitment (“TRAC”) agreement with the Internal Revenue Service. By complying with the educational and other requirements of the TRAC agreement, we reduce the likelihood of potential employer-only FICA assessments for unreported or under reported tips. 
 EMPLOYEES 
 On February 25, 2019, we employed approximately 22,000 employees at our 202 restaurants. Most of our employees in our restaurant operations provide their services on a part-time basis, as defined by the Affordable Care Act. We also employed approximately 215 employees at our restaurant support center and in our field supervision organization. We believe that we maintain favorable relations with our employees. Currently, no unions or collective bargaining arrangements are in place at our Company. 
INSURANCE 
 We maintain property and casualty insurance with coverage and limits we believe are currently appropriate for our operations. We retain a substantial portion of our workers’ compensation and general liability costs through self-insured retentions and large deductibles. There is no assurance that any insurance coverage maintained by us will be adequate or that we will not experience claims in excess of our coverage limits; that we can continue to obtain and maintain such insurance at all; or that our premium costs will not rise to an extent that they will adversely affect our ability to economically obtain or maintain such insurance. We carry employment practices insurance, which covers claims involving matters such as harassment, discrimination, and wrongful termination; however, it excludes wage and hour claims and other matters. A settlement or judgment against us in excess of, or outside of, our coverage limitations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial position and business. See “Limitations in our insurance coverage or rising insurance costs could adversely affect our business or financial condition in certain circumstances” in “Risk Factors” contained in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
TRADEMARKS AND COPYRIGHTS 
 We believe that our trademarks, service marks and other proprietary rights have significant value and are important to our brand-building effort and the marketing of our restaurant concept. Our domestically-registered trademarks and service marks include, among others, our stylized logos displaying the name “BJ’s” for restaurant services, restaurant and bar services, on-line ordering and take-out restaurant services and the word mark “BJ’s” for restaurant and bar services, take-out and carry-out restaurant services. We have also registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office many of our standard and seasonal beer logos and names, as well as many of our signature menu item names including “Great White” and “Sweet Pig” for our proprietary pizzas, “Pizookie” for our proprietary dessert and “Enlightened Entrees,” “Craft Matters” and “Wow, I Love This Place” for our branding. We have registered our BJ’s logo mark in a number of foreign countries. Additional domestic and foreign trademark applications are pending. We have also registered our ownership of the internet domain name “www.bjsrestaurants.com” and other internet domain names. We have in the past protected, and expect to continue to vigorously protect, our proprietary rights. We cannot predict whether steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of these rights or the use by others of restaurant features based upon, or otherwise similar to, our concept and products. There may be other restaurants, retailers and/or businesses that also use the letters “BJ’s” in some form or fashion throughout the United States and abroad. It may be difficult for us to prevent others from copying elements of our concept. Any litigation undertaken to enforce our rights will likely be costly. In addition, we may face claims of misappropriation or infringement of third parties’ trademarks, patents or other intellectual property rights. Defending these claims may be costly and, if unsuccessful, may prevent us from continuing to use certain intellectual property rights or information in the future and may result in a judgment or monetary damages.
