Cyber Enviro-Tech, Inc is a water science technology company focusing on the remediation of contaminated industrial wastewater with an initial emphasis on the oil & gas industry. We do this by integrating technologies to include cyber, aerospace, satellite, industrial and AI engineering telemetry. Our water filtration, waste water and alternative energy systems will have neural sensors, controls and networks - all connected to a cellular device.
 
There are 26 oil wells on our Pilot Oil Field and when funds become available the Company will change over the old pumper jack systems to CETI’s current system.
 
The Company is reviewing its next project where CETI would complete its oil field water filtration system and put the system into use on the Pilot Oil field in Callahan County. At this time, CETI has not put its water filtration system into place at any location nor has it entered into any contracts with operators to put the water filtration system into the field.
 
Our focus for the current fiscal year will be on further developing oil production on 479-acre Pilot Oil Field in Callahan County, Texas.
 
Sales Strategy – CETI’s B2B Sales Strategy will include partnering with individuals and companies who have many years of experience and developed relationships within their respective aforementioned targeted verticals. Prior knowledge of those specific industry issues, water filtration needs, history and relationships developed over many years will enable them to shorten the sales cycle for our water filtration system. As of January 11, 2023 the company has not employed any individuals or companies for its B2B Sales Strategy.
 
Market Demand and Size - CETI’s water filtration system can be modified to address many of the water contamination issue that exists anywhere in the world. The markets envisioned for the CETI water filtration system when funds permit would be both domestic (U.S.) and global.
