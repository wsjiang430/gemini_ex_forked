ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview



We are a blockchain, cybersecurity, and social media company that not only focuses on protecting privacy on personal devices, but also protects user information after it is shared with others. We believe that one’s right to privacy should not end the moment they click “send”, and that we all deserve the same right to privacy online that we enjoy in our own living rooms. Our flagship product, DatChat Messenger & Private Social Network, is a privacy platform and mobile application that gives users the ability to communicate with the privacy and protection they deserve. Recently. we have expanded our business and product offerings to include the co-development of a mobile-based social metaverse, known as “The Habytat”, as well as the development of VenVūū, an advertising and non-fungible token (“NFT”) monetization platform.
DatChat Messenger & Private Social Network



Our platform allows users to exercise control over their messages and posts, even after they are sent. Through our application, users can delete messages that they have sent, on their own device and the recipient’s device as well. There is no set time limit within which they must exercise this choice. A user can elect at any time to delete a message that they previously sent to a recipient’s device.



The application also enables users to hide secret and encrypted messages behind a cover, which messages can only be unlocked by the recipient and which are automatically destroyed after a fixed number of views or fixed amount of time. Users can decide how long their messages last on the recipient’s device. The application also includes a screen shot protection system, which makes it virtually impossible for the recipient to screenshot a message or picture before it gets destroyed. In addition, users can delete entire conversations at any time, making it like the conversation never even happened.



In addition to the foregoing, the application also provides users with the ability to connect via an encrypted live video chat that also is designed to prevent screenshots or screen grabs.



The application integrates with iMessage, making private messages potentially available to hundreds of millions of users.



The Habytat



In June 2022, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, SmarterVerse, Inc. (“SmarterVerse”). In July 2022, SmarterVerse entered into a development agreement with MetaBizz, LLC, an infrastructure firm that creates and develops 4D experiences in the metaverse (“MetaBizz”).



In November 2022, we launched The Habytat, a virtual space that blends real world and virtual realities into one, in real time, using emerging technology like virtual and augmented reality, to create a highly immersive 3D environment.



In January 2023, we launched Geniuz City, the first world within The Habytat. Geniuz City is intended to be a near photo-realistic world that is based on the city of Miami and its surrounding areas. Geniuz City has been designed in a manner that can enable users to participate in a number of different activities, such as parties, business conferences, shopping, socializing, and game play.

Currently, once users download The Habytat application, we plan to grant each user rights to use a designated piece of virtual property in Geniuz City through the minting and issuance of a unique NFT. NFTs (or non-fungible tokens) are digital assets that can represent a unique real-world asset, such as art, music, in-game items, videos, or a piece of real estate or virtual property. Users will initially be able to choose the style of house they want, then start customizing it to represent their personal style and taste. Users will then be able to accumulate reward points when they visit and interact with such virtual property or invite others to join The Habytat, and such rewards can be used to enhance, expand, and improve the virtual property.



In addition, we plan to offer users the ability to have their own pets in the Habytat, which they will need to care for and can train to follow basic obedience commands. Finally, as described below, we plan to integrate our VenVūū, platform and VenVūū, dynamic NFTs (collectively, VenVūū,”) into The Habytat, and that such integration will enable us and users to generate advertising-based revenues in The Habytat.



VenVūū



We are currently developing VenVūū, an advertising and NFT monetization platform. VenVūū is based upon a proprietary metaverse ad network and dynamic NFT technology which we believe will allow advertisers and landowners to connect in the metaverse. Management believes that metaverse advertising parallels reality,.and that VenVūū can be considered as a parallel to billboards in the real world or “Google Ads” within the internet. Through the integration of VenVūū, which advertises in a way similar to a billboard or video screen, we plan to enable users of The Habytat opportunities to monetize their virtual property rights by directly displaying approved advertisements on their virtual property. While we currently plan to launch VenVuu in the Habytat, it may also by interoperable within other metaverses in the future We believe that these features can potentially provide brands with the ability to run campaigns that target the land parcels they want to reach, simultaneously across multiple metaverses.



Competition



DatChat Messenger & Private Social Network



The current market for mobile messenger applications is highly competitive, and we expect that it will remain competitive. There are currently several large companies that provide mobile messenger applications and we expect several more competitors to enter into this market in the next few years. Well-established competitors include Snapchat, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Facebook, Telegram, MeWe, Confide and Apple iMessage. We believe that it is the range of privacy and security features that we offer that sets us apart from our competitors.



Our flagship applications are the DatChat Privacy Platform and Private Encrypted Social Network, which address the needs of consumers and businesses to communicate with increased levels of privacy and control over messages and social posts, even after they are sent or shared. In addition, we are developing a blockchain-based, decentralized communications platform that is being designed to allow consumers and businesses to connect directly with each other.



Observing that mobile messaging and social media users are drawn to several different messaging platforms by specific capabilities, we set out to create the application to consolidate popular messaging and social media features such as group chats, emoticons and video sharing, offer new and unique features such as being able to “nuke” a conversation to remove all traces of it from all parties involved, and deliver increased levels of privacy and security. As public concerns over privacy in an ever-expanding digital society grow, the application offers comfort to its users with extensive control over their messages and posts, even after they are sent or shared. The application allows users to not only control how long or how many times a message or post may be viewed by the recipient, but also allows the sender to erase the message or entire conversation after it is sent. Our goal is to make the application a leader in the mobile secure messaging and social media market based upon our proprietary technology and enhanced privacy and security features. We intend to roll out additional features including video chat, attachments, unique social posts and other features to enhance the messaging and social media experience.

Software and Development



DatChat Messenger & Private Social Network



Our ability to compete depends in large part on our continuous commitment to research and development, our ability to rapidly introduce new features and functionality and our ability to improve proven applications for established markets in which we have competitive advantages. We intend to work closely with our customers to continuously enhance the performance, functionality, usability, reliability and flexibility of the application.



Our software and development team is responsible for the design enhancements, development, testing and certification of the application. In addition, we may, in the future, utilize third parties for our automated testing, managed upgrades, software development and other technology services. We are also developing video messages and video messages containing hidden messages embedded in the video stream. We anticipate that the video messaging currently under development will allow users to change the number of views allowed or destruct the message after being sent, in addition to setting the message to auto-self-destruct. We are also in the process of developing a private and encrypted social wall/network.



The Habytat and VenVūū



Our software and development is led by our Head of Business Development, Gianfranco Lopane and SmaterVerse’s Chief Innovation Officer, Rene J. Palacio Mongui, Chief Technology Officer, Mark Mathis, and Chief Operating Officer, Ingrith Gartner Salazar. The software and development team is responsible for the engineering, development, design, integration and testing of The Habytat metaverse and the VenVūū dynamic content NFT technology.



Marketing and Monetization



DatChat Messenger & Private Social Network



The application is currently offered for free on Apple’s App Store and Google Play. Initial marketing is expected to consist of public relations, “cost-per-install” campaigns, social media marketing using the Facebook’s ad platform and other readily available advertising platforms.



We anticipate utilizing social influencers and additional public relations strategies to promote the application on a global basis, which also includes making the application available for use in other languages.



We also plan to add in-app purchases such as user customization features, unique emoticons, stickers and long form video messages to monetize the application.



We anticipate monetizing the application with a subscription-based service for small and medium size businesses. In the future, we may develop other mobile applications and services for consumers once our user base reaches a level at which we deem it to be economically feasible. No assurance can be given that we will successfully develop new or future applications that will be embraced by users or generate revenue.



The Habytat and VenVūū



We have entered into strategic alliances with House of Kibba’s Project Origin metaverse, Yakushima Corp.’s Yakuverse, AVTR Studios Taipei’s metaverse, and ZOAN’s Cornerstone.land metaverse to integrate the VenVūū NFT monetization platform and The Habytat. We anticipate that each strategic alliance will mutually benefit from the cross-promotion of each other’s platforms and products. Additionally, MetaBizz will contribute over twenty engineers and designers based in both North and South America.

Intellectual Property Portfolio



DatChat Messenger & Private Social Network



We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology and inventions that are commercially important to our business, including seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position through a combination of intellectual property rights in the United States, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secret laws and internal procedures. Our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technologies.



As of March 27, 2023, we had 7 issued patents, 0 notices of allowance and 0 filed patent applications in the United States relating to our encryption technologies and blockchain platform. Our issued patents will expire in 2036. In addition, we plan to continue expanding and strengthening our IP portfolio with additional patent applications in the future. We may not be able to obtain protection for our intellectual property, and our existing and future patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with competitive advantages or distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors. Our pending patent application and future applications may not result in the issuance of patents, and any resulting issued patents may have claims narrower than those in our patent applications. Additionally, our current and future patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights may be contested, circumvented, or found unenforceable or invalid, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them. Our internal controls may not always be effective at preventing unauthorized parties from obtaining our intellectual property and proprietary technologies.



Other companies that own patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights related to the mobile, encryption, blockchain, communication, privacy, internet, and other technology-related industries frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, and other violations of intellectual property or other rights. Third parties, including our competitors, may make claims from time to time that we have infringed their patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, or other intellectual property rights. As our business grows and competition rises, the risk of facing claims related to intellectual property and litigation matters will likely increase.



Our Privacy Policy



Privacy and security are the foundations of our Company. We recognize that this is why users are drawn to the application and that our users care deeply about how their personal information is collected, used and shared. When you read our Privacy Policy, we hope that you notice that it has been written to advance our core principles and protect the integrity of the application.



When users sign up for the application, they are required to provide us with certain personal information such as their name, email address and phone number. We take commercially reasonable and appropriate measures to protect this personal information from accidental loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction, taking into account the risks involved in processing and the nature of such data, and comply with applicable laws and regulations. We do not currently transfer any personal information to third-parties that do not act on our behalf, and we will not do so without users’ opt-in consent. Similarly, we do not currently collect sensitive personal information from users without opt-in consent. We may disclose personal information to certain types of third-party companies, but only to the extent needed to enable them to provide such services. The types of companies that may receive personal information and their functions are: marketing assistance, analytics and reporting, customer support, email and SMS delivery, cloud infrastructure, and systems monitoring. All such third parties function as our agents, performing services at our instruction and on our behalf pursuant to contracts which require them to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by our Privacy Policy. In addition, we may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including for the purpose of meeting national security or law enforcement requirements. We may also disclose personal information to other third parties when compelled to do so by government authorities or required by law or regulation including, but not limited to, in response to court orders and subpoenas.

With respect to retention of personal information, we may only retain such users’ personal information in a form that identifies them only for as long as it serves the purpose(s) for which it was initially collected as stated in our Privacy Policy, or subsequently authorized. We may continue processing users’ personal information for longer periods, but only for the time and to the extent such processing reasonably serves the purposes of statistical analysis, and subject to the protection of our Privacy Policy. After such time periods have expired, we may either delete the personal information or retain it in a form such that it does not identify the user personally.



Most importantly, when users send an encrypted message through the application, we may only temporarily process and store the message in its encrypted form. We do not (and cannot) read our users’ encrypted messages and we delete our users’ messages as soon as they have been successfully self-destructed or deleted. Our end-to-end encryption ensures that we will never have access to the contents of our users’ messages. Moreover, we recognize the privacy rights of our users and are committed to complying with data protection laws to the extent they apply to us, and to assist our users in exercising their rights under applicable law. For example, users may exercise their rights pursuant to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) or Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code, simply by submitting a request via email to privacy@DatChat.com.
