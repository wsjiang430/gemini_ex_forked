Telecommunications Services
 
WorldCALL Public’s LDI Network provides local and international interconnect services to customers and other telecommunications providers in Pakistan using its LDI network. It is one of the largest LDI networks in Pakistan. The current capacity of WorldCALL Public’s network is nearly 8 million minutes per day of traffic.
Broadband Services
 
WorldCALL Public’s broadband services include digital television, analog cable television, and broadband internet services.
 
Broadband makes it easy to transfer heavy data, send/receive large emails, download music, and view videos online. According to Media Partners Asia, WorldCALL Public is one of the largest Cable Television operators in Pakistan.
 

■ | Digital Television Services: For digital television services, WorldCALL Public provides a Set-top box for digital signal, which is a converter box that converts an encrypted signal from our central office to the customer’s location where the signal is provided to the customer’s television. Our digital television offers more than 200 channels, providing a television entertainment experience with sharper images, vibrant colors, and stereo sound. We presently have approximately 40,000 customers for our digital television at a monthly cost of between $1 to $8 which includes Internet and digital television.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
■ | Analog Cable Television Services: For analog television services, WorldCALL Public provides a coaxial connection, which is directly connected to the customer’s television. Our analog cable television offers 80+ crystal clear channels, including a wide assortment of satellite and in-house channels with a wide range of movies, news, and documentaries. We presently have approximately 750,000 customers for our analog television at a monthly cost of between $1 to $ 8. This does not include Internet. 
■ | Internet Service: We provide internet services to our customers, that allow for data downloads and data uploads. This includes internet access, email facilities, web-page facilities, and any other related internet facility or services that we may provide from time to time. 

 
We use Hybrid Fiber Coaxial (HFC) to transport our signal from our central facility to distribution points within our network using fiber optics. We convert the signal at each location to an RF signal, which is transported by coaxial cable to our customer locations to provide digital and analog cable and internet. Our Hybrid Fiber Coaxial (HFC) coverage extends to nearly 200,000 home passes in Lahore and Karachi, the two largest cities of Pakistan with a combined population of 27 million, as shown by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics. Our Cable TV coverage extends to four (4) additional cities and reaches nearly a million households. All connectivity is provided to local loop operators on fiber for further distribution on loop holder HFC infrastructure.
 
We use cable modems for data connectivity where our coaxial cable is connected to a cable modem which converts the signal for download and uploads to the customer premise equipment. For FTTH (Fiber to the Home), we use Optical line termination (“OLT”) and an Optical Network Termination (“ONT”). On a fiber network, the ONT/ONU is located at customer premises. The purpose of this device is to use optical fiber to connect to the passive optical network (PON) and communicate with the Internet service provider to get an Internet connection.
 
Long Haul and Metro Fiber 
 
WorldCALL Public has deployed approximately 1,900 kilometers of metro fiber in 20 cities across Pakistan to provide its customers with internet and television service. The metro fiber network is located in dense urban centers, giving it a considerable advantage in service activation and last mile connectivity to market. WorldCALL Public has an advantage over its competitors because WorldCALL Public uses its own fiber network to transmit data and provide its broadband services to its customers, whereas competitors lease fiber from other entities, including WorldCALL Public, and then build their network to offer services to end users.

WorldCALL Public also has 4,500 kilometers of fiber in three fully redundant ring configurations across one long haul infrastructure which will be activated in the near future. Once activated, the combination of metro fiber and long-haul infrastructure will allow coverage to approximately 3.2 million homes passed.
