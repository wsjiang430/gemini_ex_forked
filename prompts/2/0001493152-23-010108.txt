Item 1. Business
General
 
Investview, Inc., a Nevada corporation (which we refer to as “we,” “us,” “our,” “Investview,” or the “Company”), operates a financial technology (FinTech) services company, offering several different lines of business, including a Financial Education and Technology business that delivers a series of products and services involving financial education, digital assets and related technology, through a network of independent distributors; and a Blockchain Technology and Crypto Mining Products and Services business including leading-edge research, development and FinTech services involving the management of digital asset technologies with a focus on Bitcoin mining and the new generation of digital assets. In addition, we are planning to create a Brokerage and Financial Markets business within the investment management and brokerage industries by commercializing on a proprietary trading platform we acquired in September 2021.
Business
 
Financial Education and Technology
 
Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, iGenius, LLC (“iGenius”), we deliver multiple services and products, both domestically and internationally, through a direct selling network, also known as multi-level marketing, of independent distributors that are offering our products and services through a subscription-based revenue model to a large base of customers that we refer to as “members”. These services and products consist of the offering of research, education, and investment tools designed to assist the self-directed investor in successfully navigating the financial markets, including equities, options, FOREX, ETFs, binary options, and cryptocurrency. We have multiple tiers of membership at varying upfront and monthly subscription costs, which provide members with the ability to select from a range of membership packages to meet their product and service needs and price point. We offer first time members a guarantee of satisfaction, whereby, during the designated trial period (10 days from initial purchase for domestic customers and 14 days from initial purchase for international customers) if the member for any reason is not satisfied with our products or services, the member may request a full refund of their subscription.
 
Our services include access to our library of educational content, as well as access to live and recorded education sessions, and trade alerts provided by independent market experts who are experienced professionals. In addition to trading tools and research, we also offer access to education and software applications that are designed to assist our members in debt reduction, increased savings, budgeting, and proper tax management. Each product subscription includes a core set of trading tools and research along with the personal finance management suite to provide an individual with access to the information necessary to cultivate and manage his or her finances and investment objectives. In addition to the financial education technology and tools, iGenius members also gain access to a variety of benefits provided through third party partnerships and affinity arrangements, including access to a discounted travel portal, crypto trading software and a digital wallet platform. Further, through a distribution arrangement we have with Oneiro NA, Inc., we have provided our members with an opportunity to purchase through Oneiro a specialty form of adaptive digital currency called “ndau”. Ndau is differentiated from other existing cryptocurrencies by its built-in structures that incentivize stability and potential for growth as well as its more energy efficient algorithm. We have also periodically engaged in the purchase of ndau to hold in our inventory.
 
We believe that the use of a direct selling distribution network is an effective way to market our products and services for purchase because demand for financial education and other services is strengthened by the ongoing personal contact between members and distributors. In addition, most of our distributors are members and use our products and services themselves, and therefore can provide first-hand testimonials about our products and services, which can serve as a powerful sales tool.
 
Blockchain Technology and Crypto Mining Products and Services
 
Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, SAFETek, LLC (“SAFETek”), we operate a Blockchain technology company that provides leading-edge research, development, and FinTech services involving the management of digital asset technologies with a focus on Bitcoin mining and the new generation of digital assets. At our North American and other international locations, SAFETek owns and manages nearly 10,000 next-generation Bitcoin application-specific integrated circuit (“ASIC”) miner machines, with over 99% of such machines being powered by renewable energy sources, mainly hydropower plants and geothermal. Bitcoin mined at our locations is used to pay certain of our expenses, including bonus and commission payments to our U.S. and foreign independent distributors for our iGenius business, or otherwise held for investment purposes. We are also developing new and more efficient ways to mine cryptocurrencies through innovations in hardware, firmware, and additional ways to develop and utilize renewable energy sources. SAFETek operates a round-the-clock Network Operation Center (NOC) to achieve higher efficiency, productivity, and availability of Bitcoin Mining Servers. Through these activities, we aim to increase the hash rate, uptime, profitability, and overall ROI of our crypto currency mining operations.

Brokerage and Financial Technologies Services
 
In order to, among other things, commercialize on the proprietary trading platform we recently acquired from MPower Trading Systems, LLC in September 2021, to take advantage of the market’s increasing acceptance and expansion of the ownership and use of digital currencies as an investable asset class (subject to any applicable regulatory limitations) and to proactively respond to increasing regulatory scrutiny relative to cryptocurrency products, we have adopted a growth plan that contemplates the creation of a brokerage and financial markets business. Our growth plan contemplates the acquisition of a registered broker-dealer, and as a complement thereto, to offer a suite of financial services that will include self-directed brokerage services, institutional trade execution services, innovative advisory services (RIA, CTA), and codeless algorithmic trading technologies, which will operate under our recently formed subsidiary, Investview Financial Group Holdings, LLC (“IFGH”).
 
In contemplation of this expansion plan, in September 2021, we completed the acquisition of the operating assets and intellectual property rights of MPower Trading Systems, LLC, the developer and owner of Prodigio, a proprietary software-based trading platform with applications within the brokerage industry. In March 2021, we also entered into agreements for the acquisition of LevelX, a brokerage firm owned by SSA Technologies LLC, a company that is controlled by Joseph Cammarata, our former chief executive officer (“LevelX”). However, due to certain complications relating to legal proceedings involving Mr. Cammarata, in connection with his activities unrelated to Investview and its businesses, we elected to terminate this agreement during 2022, and continue our search for alternative acquisitions within the brokerage industry.
 
Apex Tek, LLC
 
Historically, through our wholly-owned subsidiaries Apex Tek, LLC and SAFETek, we sold high powered data processing equipment, known as the Apex package, to our customers which equipment was then leased back to us for our crypto mining operations. We discontinued sales of the Apex package in June 2020 principally due to supply chain issues related to COVID-19 and implemented a buy-back program whereby we offered to repurchase such equipment and cancel the existing lease, by way of a 48-month promissory note. Through the buy-back program, we repurchased substantially all of the Apex equipment in late 2020. We repaid approximately $3 million and $4 million on account of such promissory notes during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and the nine months ended December 31, 2021, respectively, and continue to pay monthly installments under the promissory notes as they become due. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”.
Sales and Marketing
 
We market our financial education and technology services and products through a network of independent “distributors” located both within the United States and internationally who market our products and services to customers through direct selling techniques, also known as multi-level marketing, and sponsor other independent distributors who also market our products and services to customers. Our independent distributors are generally members who elect to participate in our distribution program. Approximately 10% of our customers are currently also distributors. We have adopted various policies and procedures to which our independent distributors are expected to adhere. We also provide training. We seek to motivate our independent distributors by offering high quality products and services and providing product support and financial incentives. iGenius distributors are eligible to receive bonuses on sales of new memberships and on upgrades in membership sold to their personally enrolled members. Bonuses for enrollments and upgraded enrollments vary depending on the level of membership that a member is enrolled in. In addition, our distributors are eligible for residual bonuses each time their personally enrolled members renew their subscriptions. We believe that the opportunity for our independent distributors to earn bonuses and commissions contributes significantly to our ability to retain our most active and productive distributors.
 
We principally market our Blockchain technology and crypto mining products and services through trade shows, business to business marketing and Blockchain supporting relationships.
 
In the United States, we generally sell our products and services on a cash or credit card basis. We also periodically accept Bitcoin as a form of payment and use it to satisfy liabilities.
 
Materials and Suppliers
 
Digital asset mining is dependent on specialized digital asset mining hardware utilizing ASIC chips to solve blocks on blockchains using the 256-bit secure hashing algorithm. Almost all of these miners are produced outside of the United States, mostly in China and Southeast Asia, by a few manufacturers. As the market value of digital assets has increased, the demand for the newest, most efficient miners has also increased, leading to scarcity in the supply, and thereby a resulting increase in the price of miners. While we do our own repairs at our facility in Texas, our mining business is highly dependent upon digital asset mining equipment suppliers providing an adequate supply of new generation digital asset mining machines at economical prices to enable profitable mining by us and by third-party customers intending to purchase our hosting and other solutions. We believe that our relationships with our power suppliers are good and that we have sufficient supply to conduct our business operations as presently contemplated.

Competition
 
Our financial education and technology services and products are sold in competition with other companies, some of whom have greater sales volumes and financial resources than we do, and sell brands that are, through advertising and promotions, better known to consumers. We rely on our independent distributors to compete effectively in the direct selling markets, and our ability to attract and retain independent distributors depends on various factors, including the training, support, quality product offerings and financial incentives for the independent distributors.
 
With respect to our crypto mining business, we operate in a highly competitive environment. The primary drivers of competition are demand for Bitcoin, sufficient capital resources to acquire large quantities of high-quality miners, the ability to secure these miners from a limited number of suppliers on rapid delivery schedules, and the ability to generate the highest productivity. Recently, there has been a significant increase in the number of Bitcoin miners attempting to expand their mining operations at scale. As more Bitcoin miners enter the space, we expect additional pressure on the industry, with greater competition for access to miners and mining infrastructure, which is in limited supply. Data center hosting is also highly competitive in the Bitcoin mining space. Our Bitcoin ASIC miner machines are nearly all powered by renewable energy, which allows us to control our power costs, enabling us to focus on optimizing our mining returns.
 
Government Regulation
 
General
 
We are subject to government regulation in connection with securities laws and regulations applicable to all publicly owned companies as well as laws and regulations applicable to businesses generally. We are also increasingly subject to governmental regulation and legislation specifically targeting Internet companies, such as privacy regulations and taxes adopted at the local, state, national and international levels. Due to the increasing use of the internet, enforcement of existing laws, (such as consumer protection regulations in connection with web-based activities), has become more aggressive, and it is expected that new laws and regulations will continue to be enacted at the local, state, national, and international levels. Such existing and new legislation, alone or combined with increasingly aggressive enforcement of existing laws, could have a material adverse effect on our future operating performance and business.
Distribution Network Model
 
Our direct selling activities are regulated by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), as well as various federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States and foreign countries. These laws and regulations are generally intended to prevent fraudulent or deceptive schemes, often referred to as “pyramid” schemes, which compensate participants primarily for recruiting additional participants without sufficient emphasis on providing tangible products and/or services. The laws and regulations governing direct selling are modified from time to time, and, like other direct selling companies, we may be subject from time to time to government investigations related to our direct selling activities. This may require us to make changes to our business model and our sales compensation plan.
Cryptocurrency Mining
 
Cryptocurrency mining is largely an unregulated activity at both the state and federal level, but government regulation is being actively considered by the United States federal government via a number of agencies and regulatory bodies. Regulations may substantially change in the future and it is presently not possible to know how regulations will apply to or impact our businesses, or when they will be effective. United States and foreign country regulation of cryptocurrency mining is also important and determinative with respect to where we conduct our mining operations.
 
As the regulatory and legal environment evolves, we may become subject to new laws, such as further regulation by the SEC and other agencies, which may affect our mining and other activities. For additional discussion regarding our belief about the potential risks existing and future regulation pose to our business, see Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” beginning on page 9 of this Annual Report.
 
Human Capital Resources
 
As of March 24, 2023, we had 33 employees, of which 29 were full-time and 4 are part-time. None of these employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have experienced no work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good. We contract with a professional employer organization, or PEO, that administers our human resources, payroll and employee benefits functions for our employees in the United States. Although we recruit and select our workers, each of these workers is also an employee of record of the PEO. As a result, these workers are compensated through the PEO, are governed by the work policies created jointly by us and the PEO and receive their annual wage statements and other payroll or labor related reports from the PEO.
 
In addition to our employees, our human capital resources also include our independent distributors for our iGenius products and services, who are located worldwide. For information about our independent distributors, see Item 1. Business—”Sales and Marketing.”

Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of trade-secret protection and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, distributors, customers, partners, and others to protect our proprietary rights. It is our general practice to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with all of our employees and independent contractors. Such agreements include a confidentiality undertaking by the employee or independent contractor; ensure that all new intellectual property developed in the course of our relationship with employees or independent contractors is assigned to us; and require the employee or independent contractor to cooperate with us to protect our intellectual property during and after their relationship with us. With respect to our Financial Education and Technology business, the intellectual property that makes our business competitive consists of, among others, the valuable trade secrets, know-how, concepts, methods, techniques and materials used in our business, consisting principally of educational materials, domain names, relationships with strategic vendors and customer lists.
 
With respect to our cryptocurrency mining business, we actively use specific hardware and software. In certain cases, source code and other software assets may be subject to an open-source license, as much technology development underway in this sector is open source. For these works, we adhere to the terms of any license agreements that may be in place. We do not currently own, and do not have any current plans to seek, any patents in connection with our existing and planned blockchain and cryptocurrency related operations.
 
With respect to our planned Brokerage and Financial Markets business, in September 2021 we acquired the source code and object code of the operational commercial ready front-end and middle office proprietary Prodigio SMART (Signal Management Automated Real-time Robotic Trading system) Trading Platform, all know-how and other intellectual property necessary, useful and/or used in the software. The acquisition is not expected to be immediately accretive to our results; however, together with our expected expansion into the broker-dealer business, if at all, it is expected to become a fundamental part of an overall strategy to create our Brokerage and Financial Markets business. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”
