Item 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Eastside Distilling, Inc. (the “Company,” “Eastside Distilling,” “we,” “us,” or “our,” below) was incorporated under the laws of Nevada in 2004 under the name of Eurocan Holdings, Ltd. In December 2014, we changed our corporate name to Eastside Distilling, Inc. to reflect our acquisition of Eastside Distilling, LLC. We operate in two segments. Our Spirits segment manufactures, blends, bottles, markets and sells a wide variety of alcoholic beverages under recognized brands in 30 U.S. states. Our Craft Canning + Printing (“Craft C+P”) segment provides digital can printing and canning services to the craft beverage industry in Washington, Oregon and Colorado. In addition to mobile co-packing services we offer co-packing services from a single fixed site in Portland, Oregon. We employ 50 people in the United States.
Mission-What We Do
 
Our mission is to source, make and deliver the best in class, end-to-end craft spirits brands and product portfolio. In addition, we offer advanced digital can printing decoration with custom graphics and co-packing services with distinct capability and craftsmanship.
Strategy
 
Our spirits brands span several alcoholic beverage categories, including whiskey, vodka, rum and tequila. We sell our products on a wholesale basis to distributors through open states, and brokers in control states. Craft C+P primarily services the craft beer, cider and kombucha beverage segments. Craft C+P offers digital can printing to customers and co-packing services, as well as operates 13 mobile lines in Seattle and Spokane, Washington; Portland, Oregon; and Denver, Colorado.
 
Our strategy is to utilize our public company stature to our advantage and position to expand our two distinct businesses – Spirits and Craft C+P. Our spirits portfolio is to be positioned as a leading regional craft spirits provider that develops brands, expands geographic presence growing revenue and cash flow. We look to grow and vertically integrate our Craft C+P business to expand our product offerings and improve our competitive position. These two segments are detailed below.
 
Segments
 
Spirits
 
Since 2014 we have developed or acquired many award-winning spirits while evolving to meet the growing demand for quality products and services associated with the burgeoning craft and premium beverage trade. Our portfolio includes originals like the Quercus garryana barrel-finished Burnside Whiskey family, Portland Potato Vodka, Hue-Hue Coffee Rum, and Azuñia Tequilas.

● | Burnside Whiskey Family – Our Burnside Whiskey Family celebrates the unique attributes of the native Oregon Oak tree (Quercus garryana). The unique complexity of each distinct whiskey comes from blending Oregon Oak barrels of differing sizes, char levels, and ages.

● | Portland Potato Vodka – Our award-winning premium craft vodka is distilled four times to ensure a smooth finish. While most vodka is made from grain, we source award winning premium potato ethanol and blend it with pristine water sourced from Oregon. 
● | Hue-Hue (pronounced “way-way”) Coffee Rum – Premium silver rum is blended with concentrated cold-brewed coffee and a small amount of Demerara sugar. We source fair-trade, single-origin Arabica coffee beans from the Finca El Paternal Estate in Huehuetenango, Guatemala that are lightly roasted for us by Portland Coffee Roasters.

● | Azuñia Tequilas – Smooth, clean, additive-free tequilas crafted by Rancho Miravalle, a second generation, family-owned-and-operated estate, bursting with authentic flavor from the local terroir of Tequila Valley, Mexico. 100% pure Weber Blue Agave is harvested by hand, roasted in traditional clay hornos, and finished with a natural, open-air fermentation process. It is bottled on-site in small batches using a consistent process to deliver consistent field-to-bottle quality and exclusively exported by Agaveros Unidos de Amatitán.

Craft Canning + Printing
 
Digital Can Printing
 
In April 2022, we initiated operations of an innovative digital can printing facility that allows us to customer-design four sizes of popular aluminum beverage cans. This flexibility allows for custom graphics of limited releases, vintages, partnerships, and special events. This new acquisition of technology gives Craft C+P the ability to offer unparalleled customization and flexibility to craft beverage producers seeking direct printing for canning projects of all sizes, while having a production capacity of over 20 million cans.

Co-packing Facility
 
We offer co-packing services for non-alcoholic canned beverages including CBD soda waters in Portland, Oregon through our recent asset acquisition, allowing us to offer end-to-end production capabilities. We are currently the exclusive provider of can printing and co-packing services for a local CBD and wellness water maker.
Mobile Canning
 
Our mobile canning business has locations in Oregon, Washington and Colorado. We use extensive proprietary and data-driven quality control measures and a robust clean-in-place procedure in order to provide the best packaging service for our customers. We take great pride in helping local beverage producers expand their distribution reach by using our service to offer industry-top quality and branding. Our greatest asset is the unmatched expertise of our talented group of printing and packaging professionals who show up every day to go above and beyond to get the job done.

Our Craft mobile team offers a variety of services and products, including:
 

● | High Mobile Canning Capacity – We operate 13 Wild Goose MC-250 machines, with the capacity to can over 150,000 barrels per year. In addition to the canning lines, we use custom in-house designed fully automated depalletizers and twist rinses. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Large Craft Volumes – With capabilities of around 600-800 cases per shift, we can manage any volume. Averaging 40 cans per minute, each machine can do 100 cases per hour.

● | Quality Control – Hach Orbispheres measure our dissolved oxygen (“DO”) during packaging to ensure the lowest Total Packaged Oxygen for the customer’s can. We use luminometers and ATP swabs to ensure sanitation of our equipment. We can provide Zahm & Nagel volume meters to measure carbon dioxide (“CO2”) volumes in carbonated products before packaging. As masters of the “double seam” we frequently take on-site measurements with micrometers. We also offer CMC Kuhnke technology to generate even more accurate measurements in the form of visual seam reports.


● | Velcorin and Nitrogen Dosing – We have both velcorin and nitrogen dosing capabilities that supports microbial control and allows packaging of still products in addition to carbonated and nitrogenated beverages. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Pre-printing and Outfeed Labeling – Bringing on advanced digital can printing technology from Hinterkopf allows us to offer customers both world-class aesthetics and full sustainability in an end-to-end branding and packaging solution, accessible from our smallest to our largest customers. We also provide outfeed labeling and the ability to package customer-provided branded cans of all varieties. 
● | Location Flexibility – We allow our customers to choose the location of canning. We bring our mobile equipment to their facility, or our customers can bring their product to us for co-packing.

Production and Supply
 
Bringing a brand to market involves several important stages, including bottle and label design, raw materials procurement, filling the bottles, and packaging the bottles in various configurations for shipment. To achieve a unique flavor profile for each brand, we use one or more of the following techniques: infusion of fruit, addition of natural flavorings, blending of products, and aging in selected casks. Once the final profile is approved and quality control standards are met, we filter the liquid as needed and bottle the product.
 
We rely on a limited number of suppliers for the sourcing of our spirit products and raw materials, including our distillate products and other ingredients. These suppliers consist of third-party producers in the U.S. and Mexico. One key supplier is Agaveros Unidos de Amatitan, SA. de CV., which supplies tequila to us. We do not have long-term, written agreements with any of our other suppliers for the production of raw materials. However, we believe that we have consistent and reliable third-party sources for the needed materials.
 
Distribution Network
 
U.S. Distribution
 
Producers and importers of beverage alcohol in the U.S. must sell their products through a three-tier distribution system.
 
In the 33 open states, the distributors are generally large, privately held companies. The distributors and wholesalers in turn sell to individual retailers, such as liquor stores, restaurants, bars, supermarkets and other outlets licensed to sell alcoholic beverages. We primarily focus our distribution efforts in six open states; California, Arizona, Colorado, Texas, Washington and Florida.
 
In the 17 control states, the states themselves function as the distributor, and regulate suppliers, including our Company. In control states, producers and importers sell their products directly to state liquor authorities, which distribute the products and either operate retail outlets or license the retail sales function to private companies, while maintaining strict control over pricing and profit. Our largest distribution channel is in the state of Oregon through the Oregon Liquor Control Commission.
 
We hold the federal importer and wholesaler license required by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau of the U.S. Treasury Department and the requisite state licenses within the states in which we conduct business.
 
Our inventory is maintained in offsite bonded warehouses at our producers, our bonded warehouse in Milwaukie, Oregon, and at bonded warehouses managed by Park Street, our fulfillment and logistics partner. We also typically have inventory in transit that we ship nationally through our network of licensed and bonded carriers.
 
Wholesalers and Distributors
 
In the United States, we are required by law to use state-licensed distributors or, in the control states, state-owned agencies performing this function, to sell our brands to retail outlets. As a result, we depend on distributors for sales, product placement and retail store penetration. All of the distributors with whom we currently work also distribute our competitors’ products and brands. As a result, we must foster and maintain our relationships with our distributors. Through our internal sales team, we have established relationships for our brands with wholesale distributors in the states where we sell our products, and our products are sold in the U.S. by these wholesale distributors, as well as by various state beverage alcohol control agencies.

Significant Customers
 
Sales to one customer, the Oregon Liquor Control Commission, accounted for approximately 18% and 20% of our consolidated sales for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
 
Sales Team
 
Spirits
 
We have a total spirits sales force of four people, who have an average of close to ten years of industry experience with premium spirits brands.
 
Our spirits sales personnel are engaged in the day-to-day interaction with our distributors, which includes setting quotas, coordinating promotional plans for our brands, maintaining adequate levels of stock, brand education and training and sales calls with distributor personnel. Our sales team also maintains relationships with key chain and retail customers through independent sales calls. They also schedule promotional events, create local brand promotion plans, host in-store tastings, where permitted, and provide wait staff and bartender training and education for our brands.
 
In addition, we have also engaged for our spirits business Park Street, a provider of back-office administrative, fulfillment, and logistical services for alcohol and beverage distributors, which services include state compliance, logistics planning, order processing, order fulfillment, distributor chargeback and bill-support management and certain accounting and reporting services. We believe, given our smaller scale, that we can leverage the outsourced services of Park Street to reduce complexity.
 
Craft C+P
 
The canning sales force is made up of four members, focusing on three regions. Their goal is to connect with and onboard new clients, as well as maintain relations and offer expanded digital can printing capabilities to current clients. The sales team provides a premium customer service experience from introductory conversations about mobile canning to the very first packaging day and beyond. Their previous experience of operating the equipment gives them deep knowledge to share with prospective customers, including trust and accountability. Our sales team is keen on strong partnerships that allow for sustainable success. We also partner with local craft beverage industry guilds and associations for creative collaborations, booth events and sponsorships.
 
Advertising, Marketing and Promotion
 
To build and sell our brands, we must effectively communicate with three distinct audiences: distributors, retail trade and end consumers. Social media, sponsorships, sampling and other promotional activities help to establish and reinforce the image of our brands, and to provide the push into the trade and pull through out of the trade that our customers demand.
 
We have significantly narrowed our focus on building three main brands, Burnside Whiskeys, Portland Potato Vodka and Azuñia Tequilas, across seven key markets.
 
In Oregon, which has the strongest distribution for Burnside Whiskeys and Portland Potato Vodka, our focus is on closing the distribution gaps and on driving consumer pull through local sponsorships.
 
In our six key open states where Azuñia is the lead brand, driving distribution is the main priority, In these states, we focus mostly on price promotions, point-of-sale materials, and tastings to drive trial.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Trademarks are an important aspect of our business. We sell our products under a number of trademarks which we own. Our brands are protected by trademark registrations or are the subject of pending applications for trademark registration in the U.S. where we distribute our brands. The trademarks may be registered in the names of our subsidiaries. In the U.S., trademark registrations need to be renewed every ten years. We expect to register our trademarks in additional markets as we expand our distribution territories.

Seasonality
 
Our business has historically followed the spirits industry seasonality trends with peak sales generally occurring in the fourth calendar quarter in spirits, primarily due to seasonal holiday buying. Our Craft C+P business typically has peak sales mid to late summer.
Competition
 
Over the past ten years, the U.S. wine and spirits industry has undergone dramatic consolidation and realignment of brands and brand ownership. The number of major importers in the U.S. has declined significantly. Today, we believe seven major companies dominate the market: Diageo PLC, Pernod Ricard S.A., Bacardi Limited, Brown-Forman Corporation, Beam Suntory Inc., Davide Campari-Milano S.p.A., and Rémy Cointreau S.A. These competitors have substantially greater resources than we do.
 
Our printing business is the only one of its kind in the Pacific Northwest. However, we compete with other can decorating companies that offer different decorating technologies. These alternative suppliers can produce can decorations at lower costs than our technology as well as at greater volumes.
 
The mobile canning and bottling industry is highly fragmented and very competitive. The threat of new entrants is high. Moreover, we compete at the hyper-local scale, where we have a customer base concentrated in the craft beer segment. One of our greatest threats associated with losing customers is the customer’s own growth and success. As new brewers grow, they are able to afford the investment in their own canning line. Recently, the growth of craft beer startups has slowed and this has affected the competition in our market and our ability to achieve adequate pricing.
 
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act, U.S. Customs laws, and the Alcoholic Beverage Control laws of the states where our products are distributed, among many other regulations.
 
The U.S. Treasury Department’s Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau regulates the production, blending, bottling, sales and advertising and transportation of alcohol products. Also, each state regulates the advertising, promotion, transportation, sale and distribution of alcohol products within its jurisdiction. We are also required to conduct business in the U.S. only with holders of licenses to import, warehouse, transport, distribute and sell spirits.
 
We are subject to U.S. regulations on spirits, marketing, and advertising, such as style, media and messages. Labeling of spirits is also regulated in many markets, varying from health warning labels to importer identification, alcohol strength and other consumer information. All beverage alcohol products sold in the U.S. must include warning statements related to risks of drinking beverage alcohol products.
 
In the U.S. control states, the state liquor commissions act in place of distributors and decide which products are to be purchased and offered for sale in their respective states. Products are selected for purchase and sale through listing procedures which are generally made available to new products only at periodically scheduled listing interviews. Consumers may purchase products not selected for listings only through special orders, if at all.
 
The distribution of alcohol-based beverages is also subject to extensive federal and state taxation in the U.S. and internationally. Most foreign countries impose excise duties on wines and distilled spirits, although the form of such taxation varies from a simple application on units of alcohol by volume to intricate systems based on the imported or wholesale value of the product. Several countries impose additional import duty on distilled spirits, often discriminating between categories in the rate of such tariffs. If we begin distributing our products internationally, import and excise duties could have a significant effect on our sales, both through reducing the consumption of alcohol and through encouraging consumer switching into lower-taxed categories of alcohol.
