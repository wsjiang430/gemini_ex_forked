Item 1. Business
Business Overview
Creative Media & Community Trust Corporation (formerly known as CIM Commercial Trust Corporation) and its subsidiaries (which may be referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as “we,” “us,” “our,” “our company” or the “Company”) are operated by affiliates of CIM Group, L.P. (“CIM Group” or “CIM”). CIM is a vertically-integrated community-focused real estate and infrastructure owner, operator, lender and developer. CIM is headquartered in Los Angeles, CA, with offices in Atlanta, GA, Chicago, IL, Dallas, TX, London, UK, New York, NY, Orlando, FL, Phoenix, AZ, and Tokyo, Japan. CIM also maintains additional offices across the United States, as well as in Korea and Hong Kong to support its platform. See the sections “Overview and History of CIM Group”, “CIM Urban Partnership Agreement” and “Investment Management Agreement” in “Item 1—Business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Creative Media & Community Trust Corporation is a Maryland corporation and REIT. We primarily acquire, develop, own and operate both premier multifamily properties situated in vibrant communities throughout the United States and Class A and creative office real assets in markets with similar business and employment characteristics to our multifamily investments. All of our real estate assets are and will generally be located in communities qualified by CIM Group as described further below. These communities are located in areas that include traditional downtown areas and suburban main streets, which have high barriers to entry, high population density, positive population trends and a propensity for growth. We believe that the critical mass of redevelopment in such areas enhances the value of real estate assets in the area. We believe that these assets will provide greater returns than similar assets in other markets, as a result of the population growth, public commitment and significant private investment that characterize these areas. 
Our current reportable segments during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 consist of two types of commercial real estate properties, namely office and hotel, as well as a segment for our lending business. As of December 31, 2022, our real estate portfolio consisted of 19 assets, all of which were fee-simple properties, including one office property which we own through our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture (the “Unconsolidated Joint Venture”). As of December 31, 2022, our 13 office properties, totaling approximately 1.3 million rentable square feet, were 81.7% occupied and our one hotel with an ancillary parking garage, which has a total of 503 rooms, had RevPAR of $126.19 for the year ended December 31, 2022. Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, we had four development sites (with one being used as a parking lot). For the year ended December 31, 2022, our office portfolio contributed approximately 54.8% of revenue from our three segments on a combined basis, while our hotel segment contributed approximately 34.6%, and our lending segment contributed approximately 10.6%. 
Strategy 
We are a Maryland corporation and REIT. Our portfolio of investments currently consists of premier multifamily, Class A and creative office real assets in vibrant and improving metropolitan communities throughout the United States. We also own one hotel in northern California and a lending platform that originates loans under the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) 7(a) loan program. We seek to apply the expertise of CIM Group to the acquisition, development and operation of premier multifamily properties situated in vibrant communities throughout the United States. We also seek to acquire, develop and operate creative office assets that cater to rapidly growing industries such as technology, media and entertainment in markets with similar business and employment characteristics to our multifamily investments. All of our multifamily and creative office assets are and will generally be located in communities qualified by CIM Group as described further below. These communities are located in areas that include traditional downtown areas and suburban main streets, which have high barriers to entry, high population density, positive population trends and a propensity for growth. We believe that the critical mass of redevelopment in such areas creates positive externalities, which enhance the value of real estate assets in the area. We believe that these assets will provide greater returns than similar assets in other markets, as a result of the population growth, public commitment and significant private investment that characterize these areas. 
Our investments in multifamily and creative office assets may take different forms, including direct equity or preferred investments, real estate development activities, side-by-side investments or co-investments with vehicles managed or owned by CIM Group and/or originating loans that are secured directly or indirectly by properties primarily located in qualified communities (“Qualified Communities”) that meet our strategy. Further, we leverage the investor relationships of CIM Group to execute on our investment pipeline using an asset-light approach for certain of our investments. Under this approach, we co-invest with one or more third parties on an asset-level by raising capital from such third parties, maintain an economic interest in the asset and, in some cases, earn a management fee and a percentage of the profits. We believe this is a compelling model that is expected to contribute to strong returns on invested capital while reducing risk by reducing our capital outlay.
We intend to dispose of assets that do not fit into our strategy over time and opportunistically (i.e., we do not have any specific time frame with respect to such dispositions). Further, as a matter of prudent management, we regularly evaluate each asset within our portfolio as well as our strategy. Such review may result in dispositions when, among other things, we believe the proceeds generated from the sale of an asset can be redeployed in one or more assets that will generate better returns, or the market value of such asset is equal to or exceeds our view of its intrinsic value. 
CIM Group Operations
CIM Group believes that a vast majority of the risks associated with acquiring real estate are mitigated by accumulating local market knowledge of the community where the asset is located. As a result, CIM Group typically spends significant resources over a period of between six months and five years evaluating communities prior to making any acquisitions. The distinct districts that CIM Group identifies through this process as targets for acquisitions are referred to as “Qualified Communities.” Qualified Communities typically have dedicated resources to become, or are currently, vibrant communities where people can live, work, shop and be entertained, all within walking distance or close proximity to public transportation. These areas, which include traditional downtown areas and suburban main streets, generally have high barriers to entry, high population density, positive population trends, a propensity for growth and support for investment. CIM Group believes that the critical mass of redevelopment in such Qualified Communities creates positive externalities, which enhance the value of real estate assets in the area. CIM Group targets acquisitions of diverse types of real estate assets, including retail, residential, office, parking, hotel, signage and mixed-use through CIM Group’s extensive network and its current opportunistic activities. 
CIM Group seeks to maximize the value of its holdings through active onsite property management and leasing. CIM Group has extensive in-house research, acquisition, credit analysis, development, finance, leasing and onsite property management capabilities, which leverage its deep understanding of metropolitan communities to position properties for multiple uses and to maximize operating income. As a vertically-integrated owner and operator, CIM Group has in-house onsite property management and leasing capabilities. Property managers prepare annual capital and operating budgets and monthly operating reports, monitor results and oversee vendor services, maintenance and capital improvement schedules. In addition, they ensure that revenue objectives are met, lease terms are followed, receivables are collected, preventative maintenance programs are implemented, vendors are evaluated and expenses are controlled. In addition, CIM Group’s real assets management committee (the “Real Assets Management Committee”) reviews and approves strategic decisions related to financing strategies and hold/sell analyses and performance tracking relative to the overall business plan. CIM Group’s organizational structure provides for continuity through multi-disciplinary teams responsible for an asset from the time of the original investment recommendation, through the implementation of the asset’s business plan, and any repositions or ultimate disposition activities.
CIM Group’s Investments and Development teams are separate groups that work very closely together on transactions requiring development or redevelopment. While the Investments team is ultimately responsible for acquisition analysis, both the Investments and Development teams perform due diligence, evaluate and determine underwriting assumptions and participate in the development management and ongoing asset management of CIM Group’s assets under development. The Development team is also responsible for the oversight and or execution of securing entitlements and the development/repositioning process. In instances where CIM Group is not the lead developer, CIM Group’s in-house Development team continues to provide development and construction oversight to co-sponsors through a shadow team that oversees the progress of the development from beginning to end to ensure adherence to the budgets, schedules, quality and scope of the project in order to maintain CIM Group’s vision for the final product. Both the Investments and Development teams interact as a cohesive team when sourcing, underwriting, acquiring, executing and managing the business plan of an opportunistic acquisition.
Competitive Advantages
We believe that CIM Group’s experienced team and vertically-integrated and multi-disciplinary organization, coupled with its community-focused and disciplined real estate approach, results in a beneficial competitive advantage. Additionally, CIM Group’s community-focused strategy is complemented by a number of other competitive advantages including CIM Group’s prudent use of leverage, underwriting approach, disciplined capital deployment, and strong network of relationships. CIM Group’s competitive advantages include: 
Vertically-Integrated Organization and Team
CIM Group is managed by its senior management team, which includes all of its Principals and its three founders, Shaul Kuba, Richard Ressler and Avraham Shemesh. CIM Group is vertically-integrated and organized into the following functional groups: Real Asset Services (which includes Development, Onsite Property Management, Commercial Leasing and Hospitality Services), Real Asset Management (which includes Investments, Portfolio Oversight, Capital Markets, Partner & Co-Investor Relations) and Shared Services (which includes Human Resources, Compliance, Operations, Legal and Finance). CIM also has an internal audit team that sits within the Operations department.
To support CIM Group’s organic growth and related platforms, CIM Group has invested substantial time and resources in building a strong and integrated team of over 1,000 employees and more than 600 professionals as of December 31, 2022. Each of the CIM Group’s vertically-integrated departments is managed by a senior level executive. Department heads have been with CIM Group on average 15 or more years. In addition to developing a core team of principals and other senior level executives, CIM Group has proactively managed its growth through career development and mentoring at both the mid and junior staffing levels, and has hired ahead of its needs, thus ensuring appropriate management and staffing. As part of this initiative, CIM Group has developed a recruiting program that hires from business schools for its associate vice president positions in the Investments team annually. CIM Group seeks to grow organically and develop and train its investment professionals to progress into senior management roles. It has been CIM Group’s practice to grow talent within the company to promotion to principal, rather than to hire from the outside. As a result, CIM has an extremely high retention rate of senior investment team members who tend to have a long tenure, strong internal network and a track record of success within the organization. 
CIM Group leverages the deep operating and industry experience of its principals and professionals, as well as their extensive relationships, to source and execute opportunistic, value add, core, debt, ground-up development and infrastructure acquisitions. Each opportunity is typically overseen by a dedicated Investment team, including an oversight Principal, one Investment lead (vice president level and above), one associate vice president and one associate from the Investments team. The team is assembled based on the expertise needed for the particular transaction. Additionally, the team works closely with staff from other departments, such as Development, Onsite Property Management, Capital Markets, Commercial Leasing, Legal and Finance. The team oversees all aspects of the project from acquisition through disposition of the asset. The team conducts the underwriting and due diligence for the transaction, presents its findings to the Investment Committee for preliminary and final approvals and oversees the project from inception to disposition. As a result, all investment professionals work across a variety of Qualified Communities and CIM Group’s knowledge base is shared across its offices.
Community Qualification
Since inception, CIM Group’s unique community qualification process has served as the foundation for all of its strategies. CIM Group targets high barrier-to-entry markets and submarkets with high population density and applies rigorous research to qualify each submarket for potential acquisitions. Since 1994, CIM Group has qualified 135 communities in high barrier-to-entry markets and has deployed capital in 75 of the communities. The qualification process generally takes between six months and five years and is a critical component of our evaluation of potential acquisitions. 
CIM Group examines the characteristics of a market to determine whether the district justifies the extensive efforts undertaken in reviewing and making potential acquisitions in its Qualified Communities. Qualified Communities generally fall into one of two categories: (i) transitional metropolitan districts and (ii) well-established, thriving metropolitan areas (typically major central business districts(“CBDs”)).
Once a community is qualified, CIM Group believes it continues to differentiate itself through the following business principles: 
•Product Non-Specific—CIM Group has extensive experience owning and operating a diverse range of property types, including retail, residential, office, parking, hotel, signage and mixed-use, which gives CIM Group the ability to effectively execute and capitalize on its strategy. Successful acquisitions require selecting the right markets coupled with providing the right product. CIM Group's experience with multiple asset types does not predispose CIM Group to select certain asset types, but instead ensures that they deliver a product mix that is consistent with the market's requirements and needs. Additionally, there is a growing trend towards developing mixed-use real estate properties in metropolitan markets which requires a diversified platform to successfully execute.
•Community-Based Tenanting—CIM Group’s strategy focuses on the entire community and the best use of assets in that community. Owning a critical mass of key properties in an area better enables CIM Group to meet the co-tenancy needs of national retailers and office tenants and thus optimize the value of these real estate properties. CIM Group believes that its community perspective gives it a significant competitive advantage in attracting tenants to its retail, office and mixed-use properties and creating synergies between the different tenant types. 
•Local Market Leadership with North American Footprint—CIM Group maintains local market knowledge and relationships, along with a diversified North American presence, through its 135 Qualified Communities 
(thus, CIM Group has the flexibility to deploy capital in its Qualified Communities only when the market environment meets CIM Group’s underwriting standards). CIM Group does not need to acquire assets in a given community or product type at a specific time due to its broad proprietary pipeline of opportunities. 
•Deploying Capital Across the Capital Stack—CIM Group has extensive experience structuring transactions across the capital stack including equity, preferred equity, senior debt and mezzanine positions, giving it the flexibility to structure transactions in efficient and creative ways.
Discipline
CIM Group’s strategy relies on its sound business plan and value creation execution to produce returns, rather than financial engineering. CIM Group’s underwriting of its potential acquisitions is performed generally both on a leveraged and unleveraged basis. Additionally, with certain exceptions, CIM Group has generally not utilized recourse or cross-collateralized debt due to its conservative underwriting standards.
CIM Group employs multiple underwriting scenarios when evaluating potential acquisition opportunities. CIM Group generally underwrites potential acquisitions utilizing long-term average exit capitalization rates for similar product types and long-term average interest rates. Where possible, these long-term averages cross multiple market cycles, thereby mitigating the risk of cyclical volatility. CIM Group’s “long-term average” underwriting is based on its belief, reinforced by its experience through multiple market cycles, that over the life of any given fund that it manages, such fund should be able to exit its holdings at long-term historical averages. CIM Group also underwrites a “current market case” scenario, which generally utilizes current submarket specific exit assumptions and interest rates, in order to reflect anticipated results under current market conditions. CIM Group believes that utilizing multiple underwriting scenarios enables CIM Group to assess potential returns relative to risk within a range of potential outcomes.
Financing Strategy
We may finance our future activities through one or more of the following methods: (i) offerings of shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Common Stock”), preferred stock or other equity and or debt securities of the Company; (ii) credit facilities and term loans; (iii) the addition of senior recourse or non-recourse debt using target acquisitions as well as existing assets as collateral, including the securitization of portions of our loan portfolio; (iv) the sale of existing assets; (v) partnering with co-investors; and or (vi) cash flows from operations. 
Risk Management
As part of its risk management strategy, CIM Group continually evaluates our assets and actively manages the risks involved in our business strategies. CIM Group’s Investments and Portfolio Oversight teams share asset management responsibilities, setting the strategy for and monitoring the performance of our assets relative to market and industry benchmarks and internal underwriting assumptions using direct knowledge of local markets provided by CIM Group’s in-house onsite property management, and leasing professionals. In-house onsite property management capabilities include monthly and annual budgeting and reporting as well as vendor services management, property maintenance and capital expenditures management. Property management seeks to ensure that revenue objectives are met, lease terms are followed, receivables are collected, preventative maintenance programs are implemented, vendors are evaluated and expenses are controlled. The Real Assets Management Committee is responsible for overseeing the asset management of CIM’s assets. The Real Assets Management Committee reviews and approves strategic decisions related to financing strategies and hold/sell analyses and tracks performance relative to overall business plan execution. The Real Assets Management Committee is comprised of CIM’s Founding Principals, Chief Compliance Officer, the Head of Portfolio Oversight and is chaired by Richard Ressler. The Real Assets Management Committee meets monthly to review updates across the various strategies. In addition to reviewing specific property-level conditions and recommendations, the Real Assets Management Committee reviews real estate and related capital market conditions, considers current market trends and monitors fund strategies and portfolio composition. The Real Assets Management Committee acts by a majority vote of the members of the Real Assets Management Committee at any meeting at which a quorum (majority of members) is present. The size, composition, and policies of the Real Assets Management Committee may change from time to time.
Regulatory Matters
Environmental Matters
Environmental laws regulate, and impose liability for, the release of hazardous or toxic substances into the environment. Under some of these laws, an owner or operator of real estate may be liable for costs related to soil or 
groundwater contamination on or migrating to or from its property. In addition, persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may be liable for the costs of cleaning up contamination at the disposal site.
These laws often impose liability regardless of whether the person knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances that caused the contamination. The presence of, or contamination resulting from, any of these substances, or the failure to properly remediate them, may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent our property, to borrow using the property as collateral or create lender’s liability for us. In addition, third parties exposed to hazardous or toxic substances may sue for personal injury damages and or property damages. For example, some laws impose liability for release of or exposure to asbestos-containing materials. As a result, in connection with our former, current or future ownership, operation, and development of real properties, or our role as a lender for loans secured directly or indirectly by real estate properties, we may be potentially liable for investigation and cleanup costs, penalties and damages under environmental laws.  
Although many of our properties have been subjected to preliminary environmental assessments, known as Phase I assessments, by independent environmental consultants that identify certain liabilities, Phase I assessments are limited in scope, and may not include or identify all potential environmental liabilities or risks associated with a property. Unless required by applicable law, we may decide not to further investigate, remedy or ameliorate the liabilities disclosed in the Phase I assessments.  
Further, these or other environmental studies may not identify all potential environmental liabilities or accurately assess whether we will incur material environmental liabilities in the future. If we do incur material environmental liabilities in the future, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow or our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations or to maintain our level of distributions on our Common Stock or Preferred Stock (as defined in “Item 1A—Risk Factors”) could be materially adversely affected.
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990
Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended (the “ADA”), all public accommodations must meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Although we believe that our properties, to the extent such properties are “public accommodations” as defined under the ADA, substantially comply with present requirements of the ADA, we have not conducted an audit or investigation of all of our properties to determine our compliance. If one or more of our properties or future properties are not in compliance with the ADA, we may be required to take remedial action which would require us to incur additional costs to bring the property into compliance. We cannot predict the ultimate amount, if any, of the cost of compliance with the ADA or the cost of any damages or attorney’s fees to private litigants or any fines imposed by the federal government in respect of any failure to comply with the ADA.
Competition
We compete with others engaged in the acquisition, origination, development, and operation of real estate and real estate-related assets. Our competitors include REITs, insurance companies, pension funds, private equity funds, sovereign wealth funds, hedge funds, mortgage banks, investment banks, commercial banks, savings and loan associations, specialty finance companies, and private and institutional investors and financial companies that pursue strategies similar to ours. Many of our competitors may be larger than us with greater access to capital and other resources and may have other advantages over us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or lower profitability targets than us, which could allow them to pursue new business more aggressively than us. We believe that our relationship with CIM Group gives us a competitive advantage that allows us to operate more effectively in the markets in which we conduct our business.
Overview and History of CIM Group
CIM Group was founded in 1994 by Shaul Kuba, Richard Ressler and Avraham Shemesh and has approximately $32.6 billion of assets owned and operated across its vehicles as of September 30, 2022. “Assets owned and operated” represents the aggregate assets owned and operated by CIM on behalf of partners (including where CIM contributes capital alongside for its own account) and co-investors, whether or not CIM has discretion, in each case without duplication. CIM Group’s successful track record is anchored by CIM Group’s community-oriented approach to acquisitions as well as a number of other competitive advantages including its prudent use of leverage, underwriting approach, disciplined capital deployment, vertically-integrated capabilities and strong network of relationships. CIM Group has generated strong risk-adjusted returns across multiple market cycles by focusing on improved asset and community performance, and capitalizing on market inefficiencies and distressed situations.
CIM Urban Partnership Agreement
Our subsidiary, CIM Urban Partners, L.P. (“CIM Urban”), is governed by CIM Urban’s partnership agreement (as amended and restated, the “CIM Urban Partnership Agreement”). The general partner of CIM Urban, Urban Partners GP, LLC (“CIM Urban GP”), is an affiliate of CIM Group and has the full, exclusive and complete right, power, authority, discretion and responsibility vested in or assumed by a general partner of a limited partnership under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act and as otherwise provided by law and is vested with the full, exclusive and complete right, power and discretion to operate, manage and control the affairs of CIM Urban, subject to the terms of the CIM Urban Partnership Agreement.
None of CIM Urban GP or any of its affiliates, members, stockholders, partners, managers, officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives will have any liability in damages or otherwise to any limited partner, any investors in CIM REIT or CIM Urban, and CIM Urban will indemnify such persons from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, lawsuits, proceedings, costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such persons in any way relating to or arising out of any action or inaction on the part of such persons when acting on behalf of CIM Urban or any of its investments, except for those liabilities that result from such persons’ fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct or breach of the terms of the CIM Urban Partnership Agreement or any other agreement between such person and CIM Urban or its affiliates.
Investment Management Agreement
CIM Urban and CIM Capital, LLC, an affiliate of CIM Group (“the Operator”), are parties to an investment management agreement pursuant to which CIM Urban engaged the Operator to provide certain services to CIM Urban (the “Investment Management Agreement”). The Operator has assigned its duties under the Investment Management Agreement to its four wholly-owned subsidiaries: CIM Capital Securities Management, LLC, a securities manager, CIM Capital RE Debt Management, LLC, a debt manager, CIM Capital Controlled Company Management, LLC, a controlled company manager, and CIM Capital Real Property Management, LLC, a real property manager. The “Operator” refers to CIM Capital, LLC and its four wholly-owned subsidiaries. 
CIM Urban pays asset management fees to the Operator on a quarterly basis in arrears. Prior to 2022, the fee was calculated as a percentage of the daily average adjusted fair value of CIM Urban’s assets as described in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Please see “—Fee Waiver” below for a description of the calculation of the asset management fees to the Operator since the beginning of 2022. The Operator is responsible for the payment of all costs and expenses relating to the general operation of its management business, including administrative expenses, employment expenses and office expenses. All costs and expenses incurred by the Operator on behalf of CIM Urban are borne by CIM Urban. In addition, CIM Urban agreed to indemnify the Operator against losses, claims, damages or liabilities, and reimburse the Operator for its legal and other expenses, in each case incurred in connection with any action, proceeding or investigation arising out of or in connection with CIM Urban’s business or affairs, except to the extent such losses or expenses result from fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct of, or a breach of the terms of the Investment Management Agreement by the Operator.
Nothing in the Investment Management Agreement limits or restricts the right of any partner, officer or employee of the Operator to engage in any other business or to devote his time and attention in part to any other business. Nothing in the Investment Management Agreement limits or restricts the right of the Operator to engage in any other business or to render services of any kind to any other person.
The Investment Management Agreement will remain in effect until CIM Urban is dissolved or CIM Urban and the Operator otherwise mutually agree.
Master Services Agreement
CIM Service Provider, LLC, an affiliate of CIM Group (the “Administrator”) provides, or arranges for other service providers to provide, management and administration services (the “Base Services”) to us and our subsidiaries under the terms of a master services agreement, dated as of March 11, 2014, as amended on May 11, 2020 (the “Master Services Agreement”). Pursuant to the Master Services Agreement, we appointed an affiliate of CIM Group as the Administrator of CIM Urban GP (“Urban GP Administrator”). For fiscal quarters prior to April 1, 2020, we paid to the Administrator, on a quarterly basis, a base service fee (the “Base Service Fee”) of approximately $1.0 million per year (which, for each year after 2014, was subject to an annual escalation by a specified inflation factor beginning on January 1 of each year). On May 11, 2020, the Master Services Agreement was amended to replace the Base Service Fee with an incentive fee (the “Prior Incentive Fee”) pursuant to which the Administrator was entitled to receive, on a quarterly basis, 15.00% of our quarterly core funds from operations in excess of a quarterly threshold equal to 1.75% (i.e., 7.00% on an annualized basis) of our average adjusted common stockholders’ equity 
(i.e., common stockholders’ equity plus accumulated depreciation and amortization) for such quarter. The amendment was effective as of April 1, 2020. No Prior Incentive fee was paid in 2020 or 2021. Please see “—Fee Waiver” below for a description of the calculation of the fees to the Administrator since the beginning of 2022. 
In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Master Services Agreement, the Administrator may receive compensation and or reimbursement for performing certain services (other than the Base Services) for us and our subsidiaries. Such services performed by the Administrator and its affiliates may include accounting, tax, reporting, internal audit, legal, compliance, risk management, IT, human resources, corporate communications, operational and on-going support in connection with our registered public offering of our Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Series A Preferred Stock”) and Series D Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Series D Preferred Stock” and, together with the Series A Preferred Stock and Series L Preferred Stock, “Preferred Stock”). The Administrator’s compensation for such services is based on the salaries and benefits of the employees of the Administrator and or its affiliates who performed such services (allocated based on the percentage of time spent on the affairs us and our subsidiaries). 
Fee Waiver
On January 5, 2022, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a Fee Waiver (the “Fee Waiver”) with the Operator and the Administrator with respect to fees that are payable to them. The Fee Waiver is effective retroactively to January 1, 2022 (the “Effective Date”). Pursuant to the Fee Waiver, the Administrator agreed to voluntarily waive any fees in excess of those set forth in the Fee Waiver, to the extent it would otherwise have been entitled to such additional compensation under the Master Service Agreement, and the Operator agreed to voluntarily waive any fees in excess of those set forth in the Fee Waiver, to the extent it would otherwise have been entitled to such additional compensation under the Investment Management Agreement. Following the end of each quarter, the Administrator will deliver to the Company (i) a calculation of the cumulative fees earned by the Operator and the Administrator under the methodology prescribed by the Fee Waiver from the Effective Date through the end of such quarter and (ii) a calculation of the cumulative fees that would have been earned by the Operator and the Administrator during such period under the Master Services Agreement and the Investment Management Agreement without giving effect to the Fee Waiver. If, in respect of any quarter, the aggregate fees that are payable under the methodology prescribed by the Fee Waiver exceed the aggregate fees that would have been payable under the Master Services Agreement and the Investment Management Agreement, without giving effect to the Fee Waiver, such quarter will be deemed an “Excess Quarter”. For any quarter following an Excess Quarter, the Company (upon the direction of the independent members of the Board) may, at its option and upon written notice to Administrator, elect to calculate all fees due to the Administrator and the Operator in accordance with the Master Services Agreement and the Investment Management Agreement, without giving effect to the Fee Waiver, from and after such Excess Quarter. Any such election by the Company will be irrevocable, and all fees due to the Administrator and the Operator from and after such election will be calculated in accordance with the Master Services Agreement and the Investment Management Agreement, without giving effect to the Fee Waiver.
The fees payable to the Operator and the Administrator are determined as follows under the Fee Waiver. 
1.Base Fee: A base asset management fee (the “Base Fee”) is payable quarterly in arrears to the Operator in an amount equal to an annual rate of 1% (or 0.25% per quarter) of the average of the “Net Asset Value Attributable to Common Stockholders” as of the first and last day of the applicable quarter. Net Asset Value Attributable to Common stockholders is defined as (a) the sum of the Company’s (1) investments in real estate at fair value, (2) cash, (3) loans receivable at fair value and (4) the book value of the other assets of the Company, excluding deferred costs and net of other liabilities at book value, less (b) the Company’s (i) debt at face value, (ii) outstanding preferred stock at stated value, and (iii) non-controlling interests at book value; provided, that, non-controlling interests in any UPREIT operating partnership relating to the Company shall not be excluded.
2.Incentive Fee: An incentive fee (the “Revised Incentive Fee”) is payable quarterly in arrears to the Administrator with respect to the quarterly core funds from operations in excess of a quarterly threshold equal to 1.75% (i.e., 7.00% on an annualized basis) of the Company’s “Adjusted Common Equity” (as defined below) for such quarter (“Excess Core FFO”) as follows: (i) no Revised Incentive Fee in any quarter in which the Excess Core FFO is $0; (ii) 100% of any Excess Core FFO up to an amount equal to the product of (x) the average of the Adjusted Common Equity as of the first and last day of the applicable quarter and (y) 0.4375%; and (iii) 20% of any Excess Core FFO thereafter. Revised Incentive Fees payable for any partial quarter will be appropriately prorated.
“Adjusted Common Equity” means Common Equity plus Excluded Depreciation and Amortization. “Common Equity” means Total Stockholders’ Equity minus Excluded Equity. “Total Stockholders’ Equity” means the amount reflected as total stockholders’ equity in accordance with GAAP on the consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its subsidiaries as of the last day of a given quarter. “Excluded Equity” means the sum of all preferred securities of the Company and its subsidiaries classified as permanent equity in accordance with GAAP on the consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its subsidiaries as of the last day of a given quarter. “Excluded Depreciation and Amortization” means, for a given quarter, the amount of all accumulated depreciation and amortization of (i) the Company and its subsidiaries and (ii) to the extent allocable to the Company and its subsidiaries, the unconsolidated affiliates, in each case as of the last day of such quarter that corresponds to the periodic depreciation and amortization expense calculated in each case in accordance with GAAP that is a permitted add back to net income calculated in accordance with GAAP when calculating funds from operations.
3.Capital Gains Fee: A capital gains fee (the “Capital Gains Fee”) is payable quarterly in arrears to the Administrator in an amount equal to (i) 15% of the cumulative aggregate realized capital gains minus the cumulative aggregate realized capital losses (in each case since the Effective Date), minus (ii) the aggregate capital gains fees paid since the Effective Date. Realized capital gains and realized capital losses are calculated by subtracting from the sales price of a property: (a) any costs incurred to sell such property, and (b) the current gross value of the property (meaning the property’s original acquisition price plus any subsequent, non-reimbursed capital improvements thereon paid for by the Company).
Other Services
CIM Management, Inc. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, the “CIM Management Entities”), all affiliates of CIM REIT and CIM Group, provide property management, leasing, and development services to CIM Urban pursuant to various agreements. 
CIM SBA Staffing, LLC, an affiliate of CIM Group (“CIM SBA”), provides personnel and resources to us pursuant to the terms of a Staffing and Reimbursement Agreement, dated as of January 1, 2015, between CIM SBA and PMC Commercial Lending, LLC, our subsidiary.

Lending Segment
Through our loans originated under the SBA 7(a) Program, we are a national lender that primarily originates loans to small businesses. We identify loan origination opportunities through personal contacts, internet referrals, attendance at trade shows and meetings, direct mailings, advertisements in trade publications and other marketing methods. We also generate loans through referrals from real estate and loan brokers, franchise representatives, existing borrowers, lawyers and accountants. In addition, as an SBA 7(a) licensee, we originated loans as an authorized lender under the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”). Originations under the PPP have ended and we had no remaining PPP loans outstanding as of December 31, 2022.
The SBA 7(a) Loan Program is the SBA’s most common loan program. The maximum loan amount for an SBA 7(a) loan is $5.0 million. Key eligibility factors are based on what the business does to generate its income, its credit history, and where the business operates. We work with potential borrowers to identify the type of loan that would be appropriate for each such borrower’s needs. Our SBA 7(a) term loans have monthly repayment terms of principal and interest and are originated with variable interest rates based on the prime rate. Most of our SBA 7(a) loans have maturities of approximately 25 years.
While we have focused on originating real estate loans almost exclusively to the limited service and mid-scale hospitality industry, we intend to increase our efforts to originate other real estate collateralized loans. These loans are anticipated to be concentrated in industries in which we previously had positive experiences, including convenience store, RV park and single purpose building owner-occupied restaurant operations and may include owner-occupied industrial operations/warehouse buildings.
Seasonality
Our revenues and expenses for our hotel property are subject to seasonality during the year. Generally, our hotel revenues are greater in the first and second quarters than the third and fourth quarters. This seasonality can be expected to cause quarterly fluctuations in revenues, segment net operating income, net income and cash provided by operating activities. In addition, the hotel industry is cyclical and demand generally follows, on a lagged basis, key macroeconomic factors. 
Tenant Concentration
Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Incorporated (“Kaiser”), which occupied office space in one of our Oakland, California properties accounted for 29.8% of our annualized rental income for the year ended December 31, 2022. No other tenant accounted for greater than 10.0% of our annualized rental income for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Human Capital
We are operated by affiliates of CIM Group and, as of December 31, 2022, only have five employees. Four of such employees are in our lending segment while one employee spends a substantial portion of the time that he devotes to us on matters relating to the lending segment. We have entered into the Master Services Agreement with the Administrator, an affiliate of CIM Group, pursuant to which the Administrator has agreed to provide, or arrange for other service providers to provide, management and administration services to us and our subsidiaries.
