Item 1.Business
Background
Goodness Growth Holdings, Inc. is a reporting issuer in Canada, with its securities listed for trading on the Canadian Securities Exchange (the “CSE”) under the symbol “GDNS” and on the OTCQX under the symbol “GDNSF”. Goodness Growth is a cannabis company whose mission is to provide safe access, quality products and value to its customers while supporting its local communities through active participation and restorative justice programs. The Company is evolving with the industry and is in the midst of a transformation to being significantly more customer-centric across its operations, which include cultivation, manufacturing, wholesale and retail business lines. With our core operations strategically located in four limited-license medical and adult-use markets, Goodness Growth cultivates and manufactures cannabis products in environmentally friendly greenhouses and other facilities and distributes these products through our growing network of Green Goods™ and other Goodness Growth branded retail dispensaries, as well as third-party dispensaries in the markets in which our subsidiaries hold operating licenses.
As of March 27, 2023, Goodness Growth is licensed in seven states and territories, consisting of Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, and Puerto Rico. As of March 27, 2023, we retail cannabis products in 18 dispensaries located in Maryland (2), Minnesota (8), New Mexico (4), and New York (4) and wholesales cannabis products, through third-party companies, in Maryland, Minnesota, and New York. 
Our registered office is located at 1500 Royal Centre, 1055 West Georgia Street, P.O. Box 11117, Vancouver, British Columbia V6E 4N7. Our head office is located at 207 South Ninth Street, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55402.
History of the Company
Our business was established in 2014 as Minnesota Medical Solutions, LLC, and we received our first license in December 2014. The Company was incorporated under the Business Corporations Act (Alberta) on November 23, 2004 under the name “Initial Capital Inc.” On May 8, 2007, the Company changed its name to “Digifonica International Inc.” following the completion of a qualifying transaction. On December 9, 2013, the Company continued into British Columbia under the name of “Dominion Energy Inc.” The Company had several name changes before ultimately changing its name to “Darien Business Development Corp.” on March 13, 2017. Vireo Health, Inc. (“Vireo U.S.”) was organized as a limited liability company under Minnesota law on February 4, 2015 and converted to a Delaware corporation on January 1, 2018. Vireo U.S. acquired all the equity of Minnesota Medical Solutions, LLC, and Empire State Health Solutions, LLC, in an equity interest swap transaction on January 1, 2018. On March 18, 2019, Vireo U.S. completed the reverse takeover transaction of Goodness Growth (formerly Vireo Health International Inc., which was formerly Darien Business Development Corp. or “Darien”) (the “RTO”) whereby Darien acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of Vireo U.S. Following the completion of the reverse takeover, the former shareholders of Vireo U.S. acquired control of the Company as they owned a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company upon completion of the RTO. Concurrently with the completion of the RTO, the Company changed our name to “Vireo Health International, Inc.” In June 2021, we changed our name to “Goodness Growth Holdings, Inc.”
Arrangement Agreement
On January 31, 2022, we entered into an Arrangement Agreement (the “Arrangement Agreement”) with Verano Holdings Inc. (“Verano”), pursuant to which Verano was to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Goodness Growth pursuant to a plan of arrangement (the “Plan of Arrangement”) under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) (the “Arrangement”). Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Arrangement Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement, holders of Goodness Growth Shares were to receive 0.22652 of a subordinate voting share of Verano (each a “Verano Subordinate Voting Share”), subject to adjustment as described below (the “Exchange Ratio”), for each Subordinate Voting Share held, and 22.652 Verano Subordinate Voting Shares for each Multiple Voting Share and Super Voting Share held, immediately prior to the effective time of the Arrangement (the “Effective Time”). At the Effective Time, in accordance with the terms of Goodness Growth’s 2019 Company Equity Incentive Plan, the terms of each 

6



Goodness Growth option and RSU were to be adjusted to entitle the holder to receive, upon exercise, in substitution for the number of Goodness Growth Shares subject to such option or RSU, that number of Verano Shares based on the Exchange Ratio. In accordance with the terms of Goodness Growth’s outstanding warrants, the terms of each Goodness Growth warrant were to be adjusted to entitle the holder to receive, upon exercise, in substitution for the number of Goodness Growth Shares subject to such warrant, that number of Verano Shares based on the Exchange Ratio. 
On October 13, 2022, Goodness Growth received a notice of purported termination of the Arrangement Agreement (the “Notice”) from Verano. The Notice asserted certain breaches of the Arrangement Agreement, including claims the Company’s public filings and communications with respect to its business and ongoing operations were misleading and that the Company breached its representations to Verano under the Arrangement Agreement. Verano also claimed, as a result of such breaches, it is entitled to payment of the $14,875,000 termination fee and its transaction expenses. Goodness Growth denies all of Verano’s allegations and affirmatively asserts that it has complied with its obligations under the Arrangement Agreement, and with its disclosure obligations under US and Canadian law, in all material respects at all times. Goodness Growth believes that Verano has no factual or legal basis to justify or support its purported grounds for termination of the Arrangement Agreement.
​
On October 21, 2022, Goodness Growth commenced an action in the Supreme Court of British Columbia against Verano arising out of Verano’s repudiation of the Arrangement Agreement, which Goodness Growth believes was wrongful. Goodness Growth is seeking damages, costs and interest, based on Verano's breach of contract and of its duty of good faith and honest performance. On November 14, 2022, Verano filed counterclaims against the Company for the termination fee and transaction expenses described above. Due to uncertainties inherent in litigation, it is not possible for Goodness Growth to predict the timing or final outcome of the legal proceedings against Verano or to determine the amount of damages, if any, that may be awarded.
​
Description of the Business
Overview of the Company
Goodness Growth is a United States-based multi-state cannabis company with significant operations in four core markets of Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, and New York. We are science-focused and dedicated to providing patients and adult-use customers with high quality cannabis-based products. We cultivate cannabis in environmentally friendly greenhouses, manufacture pharmaceutical-grade cannabis extracts, and sell our products at both Company-owned and third-party dispensaries to qualifying patients and adult-use customers. We currently serve thousands of customers each month.
New Mexico sales of adult-use products began on April 1, 2022. In 2021, New York adopted legislation allowing adult-use cannabis and sales began in January, 2023. Maryland voters approved recreational marijuana legalization in the fourth quarter of 2022, and recreational sales are expected to begin in the next eighteen months. Minnesota has the potential to enact adult-use legalization in the next 18 months; as of March 27, 2023, bills are pending in both houses of the Minnesota legislature that, if reconciled to a common text, passed by both houses and signed into law by the Minnesota Governor, would establish an adult-use program in Minnesota. As of March 27, 2023, four of our markets are operational, with 18 of our total retail dispensary licenses open for business.

​
Our mission is to provide patients and consumers with best-in-class cannabis products and expert advice, informed by medicine and science. We also are seeking to develop intellectual property that is complementary to our mission, including novel product formulations, novel delivery systems and harm-mitigation processes. 
We have developed proprietary cannabis strains, cultivation methods, carbon dioxide extraction, ethanol extraction, and other processes related to the production, refinement, and packaging of cannabis products. We have documented the relevant processes in the form of standard operating procedures and work instructions, which are only shared with third parties when absolutely required and then only upon receipt of written non-disclosure agreements.
We have sought and continue to seek to protect our trademark and service mark rights. Because the cultivation, processing, possession, transport and sale of cannabis and cannabis-related products remain illegal under the Controlled Substances Act (as defined below) we are not able to fully protect our intellectual property at the federal level. As a result, we have 

8



sought and continue to seek federal registrations in limited classes of goods and services and have obtained several state registrations.
The Cannabis Industry and Business Lines of the Company
According to market research projections by cannabis researcher Brightfield Group, U.S. sales of legal cannabis are expected to reach over $31.8 billion in 2023 and $50.7 billion in 2028.
As described further below, United States federal law now bifurcates the legality of “hemp” from “marihuana” (also commonly known as “marijuana”). For purposes of this filing, the term “cannabis” means “marihuana” as set forth in the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 811) (the “Controlled Substances Act”) and is used interchangeably with the term “marijuana.”
To date, in the United States, medical cannabis has been legalized in 39 states and the District of Columbia, while 21 states and the District of Columbia have approved cannabis for recreational use by adults (adult-use).
We strive to meet best-in-class health, safety and quality standards relating to the growth, production and sale of cannabis medicines, and products for consumers. Our offerings include cannabis flower, cannabis oil, cannabis topicals, orally ingestible tablets, capsules featuring cannabinoids, and vaporizer pens and cartridges.
We are a vertically integrated cannabis company that operates from “seed-to-sale.” We have three business lines:

i. | Cultivation: We grow cannabis in outdoor, indoor and greenhouse facilities. Our expertise in growing enables us to produce award-winning and proprietary strains in a cost-effective manner. We sell our products in company-owned or -managed dispensaries and to third parties where lawful.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


ii. | Production: We convert cannabis biomass into formulated oil, using a variety of extraction techniques. We use some of this oil to produce consumer products such as vaporizer cartridges and edibles, and we sell some oil to third parties in jurisdictions where this practice is lawful.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


iii. | Retail Dispensaries: We operate retail dispensaries that sell proprietary and, where lawful, third-party cannabis products to retail customers and patients.
-----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cultivation
We have rights to operate cultivation facilities in six states and Puerto Rico. Although pricing pressure for dried flower in several mature cannabis markets has led some operators to eschew cultivation, in certain markets the transition from medical-only to adult-use cannabis has increased wholesale market prices significantly. We believe that our cultivation operations provide certain other benefits, including:

i. | Low Cost: We continually seeks ways to optimize our growing processes and minimize expenses. By having control over our own cultivation, we can reduce input costs and maximize margins. We believe that production at scale is critical to drive down unit cost.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


ii. | Product Availability: Control over our cultivation facilities allows us to monitor and update the product mix in our dispensaries to meet evolving demand, especially in the form of strain selection and diversity.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


iii. | Quality Assurance: Quality and safety of cannabis products are critically important to our customers. Control over growing processes greatly reduces the risk of plant contamination or infestation. We believe that products with consistent quality can demand higher retail prices.
-----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our focuses on quality, potency, strain diversity and production at scale are important because we believe that the wholesale market for cannabis plant material will become increasingly price competitive over time. More companies are 

9



entering, and will likely continue to enter, this segment of the industry. We believe that manufacturers and retailers that source high-quality, low-cost plant material will have a significant advantage in the medium and long term.
Cultivation and Production Facilities
Except for our bifurcated cultivation-only and production-only facilities in Maryland, we operate combined cultivation and production facilities. Each cultivation and production facility focuses primarily on the development of cannabis products and dried cannabis plant material for medical and other consumer use, as well as the research and development of new strains of cannabis. At all our facilities, we focus on consumer safety and maintaining strict quality control. The methods used in our facilities result in several key benefits, including consistent production of high-quality product and the minimization of product recalls and complaints from patients and adult-use customers.
We operate the following cultivation and production facilities as of the close of business on March 27, 2023:

Maryland: | ·​​·​​​·​​· | We operate one cultivation facility of approximately 110,000 square feet and one production facility of approximately 30,000 square feet. ​In March 2021, we transferred the cultivation license from our formerly co-located cultivation and processing facility to another facility consisting of approximately 110,000 square feet of greenhouse space and associated land and buildings. The production operation remains at the original combined cultivation and processing facility.​Our wholesale business is continuing to experience growth in this medical market. Investments in proprietary edible formulations and the introduction of new brands have the potential for improved financial results. ​We have a number of customers; our results of operations and financial results in Maryland are not dependent upon sales to one or a few major customers. ​ 
-----------+-------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Minnesota | · | Currently operate one cultivation and production facility of approximately 90,000 square feet. 
 | · | We have a large number of customers; our results of operations and financial results in Minnesota are not dependent upon sales to one or a few major customers. 
New Mexico | · | Currently operate approximately 15,600 square feet of cultivation and production and have four operational retail dispensaries. 
 | · | We have a large number of customers; our results of operations and financial results in New Mexico are not dependent upon sales to one or a few major customers. 
 | · | Current cultivation capacity in New Mexico is insufficient to supply our dispensaries adequately and, therefore, we must purchase a portion of our flower inventory, as well as most manufactured cannabis products, from licensed, third-party suppliers. The availability of cannabis products from these suppliers is consistent. 
New York | · | Currently operate one cultivation and production facility of approximately 60,000 square feet. Additional 120,000 square feet of cultivation and productions space is under construction and intended primarily to support the adult-use market, when and if we are licensed to sell into that market. 
 | · | We purchase a modest portion of our manufactured products inventory from several of the nine other registered organizations. 
 | · | While we believe the long-term opportunity in New York is substantial, recent performance has been impacted by neighboring states transitioning to recreational-use jurisdictions, by substantial investments in retail dispensaries and cultivation by certain of New York’s nine competitive registered organizations (vertically-integrated medical cannabis companies), and by the delayed rollout of the state’s adult-use cannabis program and resultant proliferation of illicit retail cannabis distribution operations in the state. We believe that new product introductions, the expansion of wholesale revenue streams, our potential participation in the adult-use market, and the potential relocation of some of our retail dispensaries to superior sites will contribute to improving profit margins in the future. We also anticipate additional growth of our home delivery service.
 | · | We have a large number of customers; our results of operations and financial results in New York are not dependent upon sales to one or a few major customers.

​
Retail Strategy
We have invested substantial resources in developing customer-friendly store designs and floorplans. In 2020, we began constructing new dispensaries using a new layout and color scheme tied to the Green Goods™ trademark and began converting existing dispensaries to this new theme.
Members of our management team have experience in real estate development, which has enabled us to secure premium locations for some of our dispensaries. Typically, we seek locations with high foot traffic and good visibility, close to densely populated residential areas. We also consider location, vehicular traffic, demographics, and competitor locations when selecting retail locations.
Principal Business Objectives
Our principal business objectives over the next 12-month period include achieving positive operating cash flow; continuing growth and expansion in the Minnesota market through flower offerings and edibles; planning and execution in New York for impending adult use program through expanding our facilities and product offerings, subject to regulatory approval; improving margins in the adult-use New Mexico market, principally through reducing costs; and increasing wholesale sales in our core markets.
​
Employees and Human Capital Resources
As of March 1, 2023, we had 519 employees, 409 of whom were full time employees. Certain of our employees in Maryland, Minnesota and New York are represented by local offices of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (“UFCW”). The collective bargaining agreements with the employees in these states expire as follows:

State | | Agreement Expiration
-----------------------+---+---------------------
Maryland | ​ | October 31, 2024 
Minnesota | ​ | November 21, 2024 
New York (non-drivers) | ​ | October 31, 2023 

​
In addition, our home delivery drivers in New York are represented by the Warehouse Production Sales & Allied Service Employees Union, AFL-CIO Local 811 (“Local 811”). Our collective bargaining agreement with Local 811 expires July 31, 2023. We consider our relations with our employees, with UFCW and with Local 811 to be good overall.
Our human capital resources objectives include identifying, recruiting, retaining, incenting and integrating our existing and additional employees into our collaborative, results-focused culture. Our compensation program is designed to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified executives and employees. We are committed to a culture that values diversity, mutual respect, equity and collaboration that helps achieve our enterprise goals.
Research and Development

Our former research and development activities primarily focused on developing new, innovative, and patent-protectable products for the cannabis market. These efforts have focused on novel cannabinoid formulations as well as accessory products designed to improve the cannabis consumption experience. We also experimented with plant spacing and nutrient blends, cannabis variety trialing and improved pest management techniques. We also engaged in research and development activities focused on developing new extracted or infused products.
Patents and Trademarks
We hold two patents for “Tobacco Products with Cannabinoid Additives and Methods for Reducing the Harm Associated with Tobacco Use” (US Patents 10,369,178 and 10,702,565) and have a number of other patents pending with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”).

Competitive Conditions and Position
Historically, Vireo U.S. won licenses in competitive, merit-based selection processes. We pursued opportunities in limited license markets with higher barriers to entry presenting an opportunity for higher returns or the development of strategic opportunities. 
The industry is highly competitive with many operators, including large multi-state operators and smaller regional and local enterprises. We face competition from other companies that have greater resources, enhanced access to public equity and debt markets, superior cultivation and manufacturing capabilities, lower operating costs, better-located retail facilities, more experienced management, or that may be more mature as businesses. There are several multi-state operators that we compete directly with in some of our operating markets. Aside from current direct competition, other operators that are sufficiently capitalized to enter the Company’s markets through new licensure or acquisitive growth are also considered potential competitors. Similarly, if and to the extent we continue to enter new markets, we will encounter new direct competitors. 
See “Risk Factors – We face intense competition in a new and rapidly growing industry from licensed companies with more experience and financial resources than we have and from unlicensed and unregulated participants.”
Regulation of Cannabis in the United States
Below is a discussion of the federal and state-level U.S. regulatory regimes in those jurisdictions where we operate through our subsidiaries. We currently operate facilities in Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, and New York. 
Regulation of Cannabis in the United States Federally
We currently directly derives a substantial portion of our revenues from the cannabis industry in certain U.S. states, which industry is illegal under U.S. Federal Law. As of December 31, 2022, the Company is directly involved (through licensed subsidiaries) in both the medical and adult-use cannabis industry in the states of New York, Minnesota, Maryland, and New Mexico, as permitted within such states under applicable state law. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that Congress has the constitutional authority to enact the existing federal prohibition on cannabis. As described further below, U.S. federal law now bifurcates the legality of “hemp” from “marihuana” (also commonly known as marijuana). For purposes of this filing, the term “cannabis” means “marihuana” as set forth in the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 811) (the “Controlled Substances Act”) and is used interchangeably with the term “marijuana.” The U.S. federal government regulates drugs through the Controlled Substances Act, which places controlled substances, including marijuana, on a schedule. Marijuana is classified as a Schedule I drug. The Department of Justice defines Schedule I drugs, substances or chemicals as “drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.” With the limited exceptions of Epidiolex, a pharmaceutical derived from the cannabis extract cannabidiol (“CBD”), and certain drugs that incorporate synthetically derived cannabinoids (i.e., Marinol, Syndros, and Cesamet), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not approved marijuana as a safe and effective drug for any indication. Moreover, under the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (commonly referred to as the 2018 Farm Bill), marijuana remains a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act, with the exception of hemp and extracts derived from hemp (such as CBD) with a tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”) concentration of less than 0.3%.
​
State laws regulating cannabis are in direct conflict with the Controlled Substances Act. Although certain states and territories of the U.S. authorize medical or recreational cannabis production and distribution by licensed or registered 

13



entities, under U.S. federal law, the possession, use, cultivation, and transfer of cannabis and any related drug paraphernalia is illegal; any such acts are criminal acts under federal law under the Controlled Substances Act. Although our activities are compliant with applicable state and local laws, strict compliance with state and local laws with respect to cannabis may neither absolve the Company of liability under U.S. federal law, nor may it provide a defense to any federal proceeding which may be brought against the Company.
There is no guarantee that state laws legalizing and regulating the sale and use of cannabis will not be repealed or overturned, or that local governmental authorities will not limit the applicability of state laws within their respective jurisdictions. Unless and until the U.S. Congress amends the Controlled Substances Act with respect to cannabis (and as to the timing or scope of any such potential amendments there can be no assurance), there is a risk that Federal authorities may enforce current U.S. federal law. We will continue to monitor compliance on an ongoing basis in accordance with our compliance program and standard operating agreement procedures. While our operations are in material compliance with all applicable state laws, regulations and licensing requirements, such activities remain illegal under United States federal law. If the Department of Justice policy were to aggressively pursue debt or equity owners of cannabis-related business and U.S. Attorneys followed such Department of Justice policies by pursuing prosecutions, then the Company could face, (i) seizure of its cash and other assets used to support or derived from its cannabis subsidiaries and (ii) the arrest of its employees, directors, officers, managers and investors, who could face charges of ancillary criminal violations of the CSA for aiding and abetting and conspiring to violate the Controlled Substances Act by virtue of providing financial support to state-licensed or permitted cultivators, processors, distributors and/or retailers of cannabis. Additionally, as has been affirmed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, employees, directors, officers, managers and investors of the Company who are not U.S. citizens face the risk of being barred from entry into the U.S., for life.
In August 2013, then-Deputy Attorney General, James Cole, authored a memorandum (the “Cole Memorandum”) addressed to all United States district attorneys acknowledging that, notwithstanding the designation of cannabis as a controlled substance at the federal level in the United States, several states had enacted laws relating to cannabis for medical purposes.
The Cole Memorandum outlined the priorities for the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) relating to the prosecution of cannabis offenses. In particular, the Cole Memorandum noted that in jurisdictions that have enacted laws legalizing cannabis in some form and that have also implemented strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems to control the cultivation, distribution, sale, and possession of cannabis, conduct in compliance with those laws and regulations is less likely to be a priority at the federal level. Notably, however, the DOJ never provided specific guidelines for what regulatory and enforcement systems it deemed sufficient under the Cole Memorandum standard. In light of limited investigative and prosecutorial resources, the Cole Memorandum concluded that the DOG should be focused on addressing only the most significant threats related to cannabis. States where medical cannabis had been legalized were not characterized as a high priority.
In March 2017, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions again noted limited federal resources and acknowledged that much of the Cole Memorandum had merit. However, on January 4, 2018, Mr. Sessions issued a memorandum that rescinded and superseded the Cole Memorandum effective immediately (the “Sessions Memorandum”). The Sessions Memorandum stated, in part, that current law reflects Congress’ determination that cannabis is a dangerous drug and cannabis activity is a serious crime”, and Mr. Sessions directed all U.S. Attorneys to enforce the laws enacted by Congress and to follow well-established principles when pursuing prosecutions related to marijuana activities. The inconsistency between federal and state laws and regulations is a major risk factor.
As a result of the Sessions Memorandum, federal prosecutors were free to utilize their prosecutorial discretion to decide whether to prosecute cannabis activities despite the existence of state-level laws that may be inconsistent with federal prohibitions. No direction was given to federal prosecutors in the Sessions Memorandum as to the priority they should ascribe to such cannabis activities, and resultantly it is uncertain how active federal prosecutors will be in relation to such activities. Furthermore, the Sessions Memorandum did not discuss the treatment of medical cannabis by federal 

14



prosecutors. As an industry best practice, despite the rescission of the Cole Memorandum, we continue to do the following to ensure compliance with the guidance provided by the Cole Memorandum:

● | Ensure the operations of our subsidiaries and business partners are compliant with all licensing requirements that are set forth with regards to cannabis operation by the applicable state, county, municipality, town, township, borough, and other political/administrative divisions. To this end, we retain appropriately experienced legal counsel to conduct the necessary due diligence to ensure compliance of our operations with all applicable regulations.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The activities relating to cannabis business adhere to the scope of the licensing obtained for example, in the states where only medical cannabis is permitted, the products are only sold to patients who hold the necessary documentation to permit the possession of the cannabis.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We only work through licensed operators, which must pass a range of requirements, adhere to strict business practice standards, and be subjected to strict regulatory oversight whereby sufficient checks and balances ensure that no revenue is distributed to criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We conduct reviews of products and product packaging to ensure that the products comply with applicable regulations and contain necessary disclaimers about the contents of the products to prevent adverse public health consequences from cannabis use and prevent impaired driving.

Former Attorney General William Barr, who succeeded Attorney General Sessions, did not provide a clear policy directive for the United States related to state-legal cannabis-related activities. However, in a written response to questions from U.S. Senator Cory Booker made as a nominee, Attorney General Barr stated, “I do not intend to go after parties who have complied with state law in reliance on the Cole Memorandum.” Attorney General Barr’s statements were not an official declaration of the DOJ policy and were not binding on the DOJ, on any U.S. Attorney or on the Federal courts. On March 11, 2021, Merrick Garland was confirmed as the new Attorney General. Attorney General Garland has not yet made a formal statement or written response on the matter; however, during his confirmation hearings he stated that federal prosecution of state-licensed cannabis operators is not a “useful use” of limited prosecutorial resources. Moreover, there is no guarantee that state laws legalizing and regulating the sale and use of cannabis will not be repealed or overturned, or that local governmental authorities will not limit the applicability of state laws within their respective jurisdictions. Unless and until the U.S. Congress amends the Controlled Substances Act with respect to cannabis (and as to the timing or scope of any such potential amendments there can be no assurance), there is a risk that Federal authorities may enforce current U.S. federal law. We will continue to monitor compliance on an ongoing basis in accordance with our compliance program and standard operating agreement procedures. While our operations are in material compliance with all applicable state laws, regulations and licensing requirements, such activities remain illegal under United States federal law. For the reasons described above and the risks further described in the Risk Factors section below, there are significant risks associated with our business.
Although the Cole Memorandum has been rescinded, Congress has passed a so-called “rider” provision in the FY 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 Consolidated Appropriations Acts to prevent the DOJ from using congressionally appropriated funds to prevent any state or jurisdiction from implementing a law that authorizes the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana. The rider is known as the “Rohrabacher-Farr” Amendment after its original lead sponsors (it is also sometimes referred to as the “Rohrabacher-Blumenauer” or, in its Senate Form, the “Leahy” Amendment, but it is referred to in this report as “Rohrabacher-Farr”).
Rohrabacher-Farr is typically included in short-term funding bills or continuing resolutions by the House of Representatives, whereas the Leahy Amendment was included in the fiscal year 2020 budget by the Senate, which was signed on December 20, 2019. Rohrabacher-Farr prevents the DOJ from using congressionally appropriated funds to enforce federal cannabis laws against regulated medical cannabis actors operating in compliance with state and local law. Rohrabacher-Farr has been renewed effective through September 30, 2023.

The risk of federal enforcement and other risks associated with the Company’s business are described in Item 1A.—"Risk Factors.”
Regulation of the Cannabis Market at State and Local Levels
Below is a summary overview of the licensing and regulatory framework in the states where Goodness Growth or our subsidiaries are currently operating under licenses or rights to operate.
Maryland
Maryland Regulatory Landscape
In 2012, a state law was enacted in Maryland to establish a state-regulated medical cannabis program. Legislation was signed in May 2013 and the program became operational on December 1, 2017. The Natalie M. LaPrade Maryland Medical Cannabis Commission (the “MMCC”) regulates the state program and awarded operational licenses in a highly competitive application process. The market is divided into three primary classes of licenses: dispensary, cultivation, and processing. Medical cannabis dispensary license pre-approvals were issued to 102 dispensaries out of a pool of over 800 applicants, 15 processing licenses were awarded out of a pool of 124 applicants and 15 cultivation licenses were awarded out of a pool of 145 applicants.
The medical cannabis program was written to allow access to medical cannabis for patients with qualifying medical conditions, including chronic pain, nausea, seizures, glaucoma, and post-traumatic stress disorder or “PTSD.”
In April 2018, Maryland lawmakers agreed to expand the state’s medical cannabis industry by adding another 20 licenses: 7 for cultivation and 13 for processing. Permitted products for sale and consumption include oil-based formulations, dry flower and edibles and other concentrates.

In November 2022, Maryland voters approved recreational marijuana legalization via ballot initiative. Under the initiative, listed as Question 4 on the ballot, adults 21 and older in Maryland will be allowed to possess up to 1.5 ounces of marijuana and grow two plants out of the public view beginning July 1, 2023.
Licenses in Maryland
We operate one dispensary in Frederick, Maryland, which opened in March 2021 and one dispensary in Baltimore, Maryland, which we acquired in November 2021. We also operate a production facility of 30,000 square feet and a 110,000 square-foot cultivation facility. We hold phase 2 licenses for cultivation, processing, and dispensing. Wholesale revenues have grown, driven in part by new product offerings and increased market penetration. Our cultivation and production licenses, as well as the license for our Frederick, Maryland dispensary, were awarded to our affiliate MaryMed, LLC through merit-based license application processes. Merit-based license awards require limited investment and thus present high-return opportunities. Our dispensary license for our Baltimore, Maryland location was acquired from Charm City Medicus, LLC on November 19, 2021. We believe that our medical and scientific background helped Goodness Growth develop a competitive advantage in the marketplace.
Maryland Licenses and Regulations
Maryland licenses are valid for six years and are subject to four-year renewals after required fees are paid and provided that the business remains in good standing. Renewal requests are typically communicated through email from the MMCC and include a renewal form.

Maryland Reporting Requirements
The State of Maryland uses Marijuana Enforcement Tracking Regulation and Compliance system (METRC) as the state’s computerized track and trace (“T&T”) system for seed-to-sale. Individual licensees whether directly or through third-party integration systems are required to push data to the state to meet all reporting requirements. We use a third-party application for our computerized seed to sale software, which integrates with the state’s METRC program and captures the required data points for cultivation, manufacturing and retail a as required in the Maryland Medical Cannabis law.Minnesota
Minnesota Regulatory Landscape
Legislation passed during the 2014 Minnesota legislative session created a new process allowing seriously ill individuals from Minnesota to use medical cannabis to treat a set of nine qualifying medical conditions. The qualifying medical conditions have been expanded to now include 15 qualifying conditions. The Medical Cannabis Program is regulated and administered by the Minnesota Department of Health which oversees all cultivation, production, and distribution facilities. In the initial program the Minnesota Department of Health had registered two manufacturers, with each manufacturer having licenses for four distribution facilities across the state. Minnesota now allows a manufacturer to operate eight distribution facilities, which may include the manufacturer’s single location for cultivation, harvesting, manufacturing, packaging, and processing but is not required to include that location.
Medical cannabis is provided to patients as a dried raw cannabis, liquid, pill, topical (lotions, balms, and patches), vaporized delivery method that does not require the use of dried leaves or plant form, water-soluble cannabinoid multi-particulates (for example, granules, powders, and sprinkles) and orally dissolvable products such as lozenges, gums, mints, buccal tablets, and sublingual tablets.
In terms of safety and security, there are several precautions built into the program. For example, registered manufacturers must contract with a laboratory for testing the quality and consistency of the medical cannabis products. Manufacturers’ facilities are also subject to state inspections.
Minnesota has also implemented a process for monitoring and evaluating the health impacts of medical cannabis on patients which will be used to help patients and health professionals grow their understanding of the benefits, risks, and side effects of medical cannabis.
In 2022, edibles and dried cannabis flower for smoking were added to the medical program in Minnesota.

On July 1, 2022, Minnesota Statutes s. 151.72 went into effect, which permits the sale, to anyone age 21 or older in the state, of edible products derived from hemp and containing no more than 5mg of THC per serving and 50mg per package. 
On January 5, 2023, H.F. No. 100 (“H.F. 100”) was introduced into the Minnesota House of Representatives. H.F. 100, if passed, reconciled with a companion bill in the Minnesota senate, and signed by the Governor, would create an adult-use cannabis program in the State of Minnesota. The probability and timing of the enactment of an adult-use cannabis program, as well as the Company’s ability to participate in any such program, remain uncertain as of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Licenses and Permits in Minnesota
Our license in Minnesota was awarded in 2015 through merit-based license application processes. Merit-based license awards require limited investment and thus present high-return opportunities. We believe that our medical and scientific expertise helped us develop a competitive advantage in the marketplace.
Vireo Health of Minnesota, LLC (“Vireo Minnesota”), which is a subsidiary of Goodness Growth, holds one vertically-integrated medical cannabis license to operate one cultivation and production facility in Otsego, MN and eight retail

medical cannabis dispensaries in the state of Minnesota, located in Blaine, Bloomington, Burnsville, Hermantown, Rochester, Minneapolis, Moorhead, and Woodbury.
Minnesota Licenses and Regulations
We currently operate eight retail dispensaries and one cultivation and production facility of approximately 90,000 square feet. Recent changes to the state’s qualifying conditions for medical cannabis patients have contributed to increases in patient enrollment. The March 2022 addition of dried raw cannabis to the list of allowed delivery methods, give our management team optimism that the Minnesota market remains a growth opportunity for the Company.

Minnesota state licenses are renewed every two years. Every two years, licensees are required to submit a renewal application with the commissioner at least six months before its registration term expires. The most recent manufacturer annual fee paid in 2021 was $189,220 and is non-refundable. Additionally, provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely manner, and there are no material violations noted against the applicable licenses, and subject to the possible effect of the enactment of H.F. 100 or any other adult-use cannabis legislation in the state, The Company expects to receive the applicable renewed license in the ordinary course of business. While the Company’s compliance controls have been developed to mitigate the risk of any material violations of a license arising, there is no assurance that the Company’s license will be renewed in the future in a timely manner. Any unexpected delays or costs associated with the licensing renewal process could impede the ongoing or planned operations of the Company and have a material, adverse effect on the Company’s business and financial results.

Minnesota Reporting Requirements
The State of Minnesota uses Marijuana Enforcement Tracking Regulation and Compliance system (METRC) as the state’s computerized T&T system for seed-to-sale. Individual licensees whether directly or through third-party integration systems are required to push data to the state to meet all reporting requirements. We use a third-party application for our computerized seed to sale software, which integrates with the state’s Metrc program and captures the required data points for cultivation, manufacturing and retail as required. 
New Mexico
New Mexico Regulatory Landscape
The Lynn and Erin Compassionate Use Act (“Compassionate Use Act”) was signed into law in 2007 and became effective July 1, 2007. The Compassionate Use Act established the regulatory framework for use of medical cannabis by New Mexico residents and created the New Mexico Medical Cannabis Program (“NMMCP”). It allows practitioners to prescribe medical cannabis to patients with a debilitating medical condition (as defined in the Compassionate Use Act). Currently, there are 23 qualifying conditions under the Compassionate Use Act. When a practitioner determines that the patient has a debilitating medical condition and provides written certification so stating and that the potential health benefits of the cannabis use would likely outweigh the health risks for the patient, the patient can apply with the New Mexico Department of Health (“NMDOH”) for a registry identification card. A qualified patient is allowed to possess cannabis in an amount that is reasonably necessary to ensure uninterrupted availability of cannabis for a period of three months. In 2019, New Mexico announced it would begin permitting non-residents of the state to obtain cannabis under the Compassionate Use Act and as of July 1, 2020, the state now extends reciprocity to residents of all other medical cannabis states, allowing visiting medical marijuana patients to use their home-state credentials to purchase at licensed New Mexico medical marijuana dispensaries.

The Cannabis Regulation Act (“Cannabis Regulation Act”) was signed into law on April 12, 2021. The Cannabis Regulation Act established the regulatory framework for use of recreational cannabis within the State of New Mexico to allow for the sale, possession, and consumption of recreational marijuana in the state for adults 21 and older. The Cannabis Regulation Act also created the Cannabis Control Division (“NMCCD”) under the New Mexico Regulation and Licensing Department, which now oversees the NMMCP. The NMMCP was previously subject to the regulatory authority of NMDOH. The first dispensaries providing adult-use cannabis began sales in April 2022.

Licenses in New Mexico
Pursuant to a management agreement with our affiliate Red Barn Growers, Inc. (“Red Barn”), a New Mexico non-profit corporation and NMCCD licensee, Vireo Health of New Mexico, LLC (“VHNM”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Goodness Growth, currently operates four dispensaries located in Albuquerque, Las Cruces, Santa Fe and Gallup and a cultivation and processing facility located in Gallup.
New Mexico Licenses and Regulations
In New Mexico, we currently operate an approximately 15,600 square feet of cultivation and production and have four operational retail dispensaries. 
The NMCCD has established the following types of cannabis licenses: couriers; producers; manufacturers; retailers; microbusinesses; cannabis consumption lounges; vertically integrated establishments; and integrated microbusinesses. Red Barn operates pursuant to a vertically integrated establishment license issued by NMCCD. Red Barn’s vertically integrated establishment licenses allows it to cultivate, process, and distribute cannabis.. Each vertically integrated licensee can operate an unlimited number of dispensaries.
New Mexico Reporting Requirements
The state of New Mexico uses BIOTRACKTHC© as the state’s computerized T&T system used to track commercial cannabis activity and seed-to-sale. Individual licensees are required to push data to the state to meet all reporting requirements.
New York
New York Regulatory Landscape
The Compassionate Care Act was signed into law on July 5, 2014. The law was expanded in January 2022 to remove a previous list of qualifying conditions. The law now allows patients to use medical cannabis for any condition that could be treated by medical cannabis as recommended by their doctor.
Physicians must complete a New York State Department of Health-approved course and register with the New York Department of Health Medical Marijuana Program to certify patients. Practitioners must consult the New York State Prescription Monitoring Program Registry prior to issuing a certification to a patient for medical cannabis.
Patients who are certified by their practitioners are required to apply to obtain a registry identification card in order to obtain medical cannabis certified patients may designate up to two caregivers, who must also register with the Department of Health, to obtain and administer medical cannabis products on behalf of the patients.
There are ten registered organizations, which each hold a vertically integrated license allowing the cultivation, manufacture, transport, distribution, and dispensation of medical cannabis. Registered organizations may only manufacture medical cannabis products in forms approved by the Commissioner of the Department of Health. Approved forms currently include whole flower, metered liquid or oil preparations, solid and semisolid preparations (e.g., capsules, chewable and effervescent tablets, lozenges), metered ground plant preparations, and topical forms and transdermal patches. The Compassionate Care Act expressly provides that a certified medical use of cannabis does not include smoking and that all prices must be approved by the New York Department of Health.
Each registered organization may have up to four dispensing facilities, owned and operated by the registered organization, where approved medical cannabis products will be dispensed to certified patients or their designated caregivers, who have registered with the Department. Dispensing facilities must report dispensing data to the New York State Prescription Monitoring Program Registry and consult the registry prior to dispensing approved medical cannabis products to certified patients or their designated caregivers.

The Marihuana Regulation & Taxation Act was signed into law on March 31, 2022, legalizing adult-use cannabis in New York State. MRTA established a new Office of Cannabis Management governed by a Cannabis Control Board to comprehensively regulate adult-use, medical, and hemp cannabis. The OCM has begun to issue licenses and is currently promulgating rules and regulations outlining how and when our business can participate in the adult-use cannabis market. 
Licenses and Permits in New York
Our licenses in New York were each awarded to us through merit-based license application processes. 
Through our subsidiary Vireo Health of New York, LLC, we hold one of ten vertically integrated medical cannabis licenses. We currently have a cultivation and processing facility in Johnstown, NY and four dispensaries throughout the State in New York City (Queens County), Binghamton, White Plains and Albany. We also operate a home-delivery service based out of our Queens dispensary.

Our New York cultivation and processing facility is approximately 21 acres and compromised of 13,650 square foot of indoor cultivation space, 38,304 square feet of greenhouse cultivation space, and 7,350 square feet of laboratory and processing space. The facility has been in continuous production and sale of cannabis since January 2016. In addition, we have under construction, on an adjacent parcel to the existing facility, approximately 110,000 square feet of incremental cultivation and processing facility housed inside a building exceeding 300,000 square feet.
New York Licenses and Regulations
In New York, we were one of the original five registered organizations, placing second in the initial selection process, and are currently one of ten registered organizations (vertically integrated medical cannabis licensees) in the state. While we believe the long-term opportunity in New York is substantial, recent performance has been impacted by neighboring states transitioning to recreational-use jurisdictions, as well as by increasing competition from other developing operators. New product introductions and the beginning of wholesale revenue streams may contribute to improving profit margins in the future. We anticipate additional growth of our home delivery service.
New York registered organization licenses expire 2 years after the date of issuance. An application to renew must be filed with the Department not more than six months nor less than four months prior to the expiration thereof. Registration fees are $200,000 and are refundable if the applicant is not granted a renewal registration.
New York Reporting Requirements
The state of New York uses BIOTRACKTHC© as the state’s cultivation and production computerized T&T system. Leaf Logix is used as state’s point of sale T&T system. Individual licensees are required to push data to the state to meet all reporting requirements.
Our Compliance Program
Expenditures for compliance with federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations are consistent from year to year and are not material to our financial results. We are compliant with all applicable regulations and properly disposes of the toxic and hazardous substances it uses in our operations.
The Company is classified as having “direct” involvement in the U.S. marijuana industry and are in material compliance with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by each state in which it operates. We are not subject to any material citations or notices of violation with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by each applicable state that may have an impact on our licenses, business activities or operations.
With the oversight of our General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer, our compliance team oversees, maintains, and implements our compliance program. In addition to our internal legal department, we have engaged state regulatory compliance counsel in many jurisdictions.

20



The compliance team oversees training for cultivation, production and dispensary managers and employees, along with other department leaders and other designated persons as needed, on compliance with state and local laws and regulations. Our compliance team also monitors all compliance notifications from the regulators and inspectors and lead the effort to timely resolve any issues identified. We keep records of all compliance notifications received from the state regulators or inspectors and how and when the issue was resolved.
We have created comprehensive standard operating procedures that include detailed descriptions and instructions for receiving shipments of inventory, inventory tracking, recordkeeping and record retention practices related to inventory, as well as procedures for performing inventory reconciliation and ensuring the accuracy of inventory tracking and recordkeeping. We maintain accurate records of our inventory at all licensed facilities. We conduct audits of our cannabis and cannabis products inventories at least weekly in order to detect any possible diversion. In addition to weekly inventory audits, security and/or compliance staff conduct unscheduled, unannounced audits to prevent complacency or the perception thereof. Adherence to our standard operating procedures is mandatory and ensures that our operations are compliant with the rules set forth by the applicable state and local laws, regulations, ordinances, licenses and other requirements. We also verify adherence to standard operating procedures by regularly conducting internal inspections and ensure that any issues identified are resolved quickly and thoroughly.
In January 2018, United States Attorney General, Jeff Sessions rescinded the Cole Memorandum and thereby created a vacuum of guidance for enforcement agencies and the DOJ. As an industry best practice, despite the recent rescission of the Cole Memorandum, we continue to do the following to ensure compliance with the guidance provided by the Cole Memorandum:

● | Ensure the operations of our subsidiaries and business partners are compliant with all licensing requirements related to cannabis operation by applicable state, county, municipality, town, township, borough, and other political/administrative divisions. To this end, we retain appropriately experienced legal counsel to conduct the necessary due diligence to ensure compliance of such operations with all applicable regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The activities relating to cannabis business adhere to the scope of the licensing obtained. For example, in the states where only medical cannabis is permitted, cannabis products are only sold to patients who hold the necessary documentation whereas, in the states where cannabis is permitted for adult recreational use, in the future, we intend to sell our cannabis products only to individuals who meet the requisite age requirements;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We adhere to compliant business practices and has implemented strict regulatory oversight to ensure that no revenue is distributed to criminal enterprises, gangs or cartels; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We conduct reviews of products and product packaging to ensure that the products comply with applicable regulations and contain necessary disclaimers about the contents of the products to prevent adverse public health consequences from cannabis use and prevent impaired driving.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We will continue to monitor compliance on an ongoing basis in accordance with our compliance program and standard operating procedures. While our operations are in compliance with all applicable state laws, regulations and licensing requirements in all material respects, such activities remain illegal under United States federal law. For the reasons described above and the risks further described in Risk Factors below, there are significant risks associated with our business. Readers are strongly encouraged to carefully read all the risk factors contained in Item 1A. Risk Factors, below.
