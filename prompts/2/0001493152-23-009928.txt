There is a growing market in Asia of companies who are seeking to go public and become listed on a recognized exchange in a foreign jurisdiction. We see tremendous opportunity to the extent that this trend continues worldwide. With respect to cross border listing advisory services, we are assisting private companies in their desire to list and trade on public exchanges, including the U.S. NASDAQ and OTC Markets. The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, signed in 2012, eases the initial public offering (“IPO”) process for “emerging growth companies” and reduces their regulatory burden, (2) improves the ability of these companies to access capital through private offerings and small public offerings without SEC registration, and (3) allows private companies with a substantial shareholder base to delay becoming a public reporting company.
 
Through our cross-border listing advisory services, we seek to form the bridge between these companies seeking to conduct their IPO (or in some cases, self-directed public offerings), and their goal of becoming a listed company on a recognized U.S. national exchange, such as NASDAQ and the NYSE.
 
While there are several alternatives for companies seeking to go public and trade on the U.S. OTC markets, we primarily focus on three methods:
 

● | Registration Statement on Form S-1 
--+---------------------------------------
● | Regulation A+ offering 
● | The Form 10 shell company 

 
The manner in which the OTC markets are structured provides companies the ability to “uplist” in the marketplace as they provide better transparency. These OTC markets include:
 

● | OTCQX Best Marketplace: offers transparent and efficient trading of established investor-focused U.S. and global companies. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | OTCQB Venture Marketplace: for early-stage and developing U.S. and international companies that are not yet able to qualify for OTCQX. 
● | OTC Pink Open Marketplace: offers trading in a wide spectrum of securities through any broker. With no minimum financial standards, this market includes foreign companies that limit their disclosure, penny stocks and shells, as well as distressed, delinquent, and dark companies not willing or able to provide adequate information to investors. 

 
We act as a case reference for our clients, as we originally had our shares quoted in the OTC markets and subsequently “uplisted” to The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC., a U.S. national securities exchange.

With growing competition and increasing economic sophistication, we believe more companies need strategies for cross-border restructuring and other corporate matters. Our plan is to bundle our Cross-Border Business Solution services with our cloud accounting solutions and Accounting Outsourcing Services described below.
 
Accounting Outsourcing Services
 
We intend to develop relationships with professional firms from Hong Kong, Malaysia, China, and Thailand that can provide company secretarial, business centers and virtual offices, book-keeping, tax compliance and planning, payroll management, business valuation, and wealth management services to our clients. We intend to include local accounting firms within this network to provide general accounting, financial evaluation and advisory services to our clients. Our expectation is that firms within our professional network will refer their international clients to us that may need our book-keeping, payroll, company secretarial and tax compliance services. We believe that this accounting outsourcing service arrangement will be beneficial to our clients by providing a convenient, one-stop firm for their local and international business and financial compliance and governance needs.
Our Service Rates
 
We intend to have a two-tiered rate system based upon the type of services being offered. We may impose project-based fees, where we charge 10% - 25% of the revenues generated by the client on projects that are completed using our services, such as transaction projects, contract compliance projects, and business planning projects. We may also charge a flat rate fee or fixed fee based on the estimated complexity and timing of a project when our professionals provide specified expertise to our clients on a project. For example, for our Cross-Border Business Solutions services, we plan to charge our client a monthly fixed fee.
Our Venture Capital Business Segment
 
Venture Capital Investment
 
As a result of our acquisition of Greenpro Venture Capital Limited (“GVCL”) in 2015, we entered a venture capital business in Hong Kong with a focus on companies located in South-East Asia and East Asia, including Hong Kong, Malaysia, China, Thailand and Singapore. Our venture capital business is focused on (1) establishing a business incubator for start-up and high growth companies to support such companies during critical growth periods and (2) investment opportunities in select start-ups and high growth companies.
 
We believe that a company’s life cycle can be divided into five stages, including the seed stage, start-up stage, expansion stage, mature stage and decline stage. We anticipate that most of a company’s funding needs will occur during these first three stages.
 

● | Seed stage: Financing is needed for assets, and research and development of an initial business concept. The company usually has relatively low costs in developing the business idea. The ownership model is considered and implemented. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Start-up stage: Financing is needed for product development and initial marketing. Firms in this phase may be in the process of setting up a business or they might have been in operating the business for a short period of time but may not have sold their products commercially. In this phase, costs are increasing due to product development, market research and the need to recruit personnel. Low levels of revenues are starting to generate. 
● | Expansion stage: Financing is needed for growth and expansion. Capital may be used to finance increased production capacity, product, or marketing development or to hire additional personnel. In the early expansion phase, sales, and production increases but there is not yet any profit. In the later expansion stage, the business typically needs extra capital in addition to organically generated profit, for further development, marketing, or product development.

We intend for our business incubators to provide valuable support to young, emerging growth and potential high growth companies at critical junctures of their development. For example, our incubators will offer office space at a below market rental rate. We will also provide our expertise, business contacts, introductions, and other resources to assist their development and growth. Depending on each individual circumstance, we may also take an active advisory role in our venture capital companies including board representation, strategic marketing, corporate governance, and capital structuring. We believe that there will be potential investment opportunities for us in these start-up companies.
 
Our business processes for our investment strategy in select start-up and high growth companies are as follows:
 

● | Step 1. Generating Deal Flow: We expect to actively search for entrepreneurial firms and to generate deal flow through our business incubator and the personal contacts of our executive team. We also anticipate that entrepreneurs will approach us for financing. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Step 2. Investment Decision: We will evaluate, examine and engage in due diligence of a prospective portfolio company, including but not limited to product/services viability, market potential and integrity as well as capability of the management. After that, both parties arrive at an agreed value for the deal. Following that is a process of negotiation which, if successful, ends with capital transformation and restructuring. 
● | Step 3. Business Development and Value Adding: In addition to capital contribution, we expect to provide expertise, knowledge and relevant business contacts to the company. 
● | Step 4. Exit: There are several ways to exit an investment in a company. Common exits are: 


○ | IPO (Initial Public Offering): The company’s shares are offered in a public sale on an established securities market. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
○ | Trade sale (Acquisition): The entire company is sold to another company. 
○ | Secondary sale: The company’s firm sells only part of its shares. 
○ | Buyback or MBO: Either the entrepreneur or the management of the company buys back the company’s shares of the firm. 
○ | Reconstruction, liquidation or bankruptcy: If the project fails, the company will restructure or close down its operations. 

 
Our objective is to achieve a superior rate of return through the eventual and timely disposal of investments. We expect to look for businesses that meet the following criteria:
 

● | high growth prospects 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | ambitious teams 
● | viability of product or service 
● | experienced management 
● | ability to convert plans into reality 
● | justification of venture capital investment and investment criteria

Our Venture Capital Related Education and Support Services.
 
In addition to providing venture capital services through GVCL, we also provide educational and support services that we believe will be synergistic with our venture capital business. We have arranged seminars called the CEO & Business Owners Strategic Session (“CBOSS”) in Malaysia and Singapore for business owners who are interested in the following:

● | Developing their business globally; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------
● | Expanding business with increased capital funding; 
● | Creating a sustainable SME business model; 
● | Accelerating the growth of the business; or 
● | Significantly increasing company cash flows. 

 
The objective of the CBOSS seminar is to educate the chief executive officers or business owners on how to acquire “smart capital” and the considerations involved. The seminar includes an introduction to the basic concepts of “smart capital,” “wealth and value creation,” recommendation and planning and similar topics. We believe that this seminar will synergistically support our venture capital business segment.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We plan to deploy three strategies to market the Greenpro brand: leadership, market segmentation and sales management process development.
 

● | Building Brand Image: Greenpro’s marketing efforts will focus on building the image of our extensive expertise and knowledge of our professionals. We intend to conduct a marketing campaign through media visibility, seminars, webinars, and the creation of a wide variety of white papers, newsletters, books, and other information. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Market segmentation: We plan to devote marketing resources to highly measurable and high return on investment tactics that specifically target those industries and areas where Greenpro has particularly deep experience and capabilities. These efforts typically involve local, regional, or national trade show and event sponsorships, targeted direct mail, email, and telemarketing campaigns, and practice and industry specific micro-sites and newsletters in the Asian region. 
● | Social Media: We plan to begin a social media campaign utilizing blogs, Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn after we secure sufficient financing. A targeted campaign will be made to the following groups of clients: law firms, auditing firms, consulting firms and small to medium-sized enterprises (“SMEs”) in different industries, including biotechnology, intellectual property, information technologies and real estate.

The campaign involves sharing content, knowledge and information about wealth management, including wealth creation, wealth protection and wealth succession.
 
The objectives of WWW are:
 

1. | To increase public awareness and recognition of Greenpro as a well-known advocate of the wealth principles described above; 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | For our philosophy to gain recognition so that our clients are confident and comfortable with our services and trust us; 
3. | To educate existing clients and potential prospects; and 
4. | To act as a channel of communication to gather market data and feedback. 

 
Set forth below are the marketing strategies we expect to develop.
 
Awareness and Optimization
 

1. | Email Blasts and E-Newsletter 
---+----------------------------------

 
Email blasts are one of the commonly used tactics to disseminate information. Our email database will be collected through leads generated by online marketing (social media) and promotional events. Future event invitations and monthly/quarterly newsletters will be sent to the email database to boost event participation and provide updates on Company development.
 

2. | Media PR and News Releases 
---+-------------------------------

 
Our post event information will be sent to news and media platforms as part of our publicity effort to increase public awareness about our events and developments, and to encourage more participants to join our upcoming events. We will also share our analysis on various industries and industry trends to the media network providers for free. We believe that this strategy will strengthen the relationship between Greenpro and the media network providers.
 

3. | Social Media 
---+-----------------

 
To generate more leads and subscribers, two to four articles related to wealth management will be shared in our official WeChat account. These articles are tools we use to share content online, through social media platforms such as WeChat, Jinri Toutiao and Facebook, which increases our online presence.
 

4. | Online Search Engine Optimization 
---+--------------------------------------

 
Online Search Engine Optimization (“SEO”) will be used as a supporting strategy to enhance our online presence campaign. We will seek a SEO expert team in China and Malaysia to assist in the promotion of the campaign by using an advertising and keyword tagging strategy to drive traffic to our social media accounts and our company website. The major search engines are Baidu and Google as these are the common search engine worldwide.

Interaction and Conversion
 

1. | Seminars and Conferences 
---+-----------------------------

 
Seminars and conferences will be held once a month to deliver and educate the attendees on wealth management. We target between 80 and 100 attendees each time. We intend to invite professionals and strategic partners to share their ideas, resources and knowhow in the seminars and conferences. The seminars and conferences will focus on our three core wealth management principles, namely “Wealth Creation, Wealth Protection and Wealth Succession”.
 

2. | Private Events by Invitation 
---+---------------------------------

 
Private and exclusive events are planned to be held quarterly with a target between 30 and 40 attendees. These events are exclusive and by-invitation only, at which we will share insights into our services and explain to attendees how they can proceed with wealth management planning.
 

3. | Small Group Meet Ups and Networking 
---+----------------------------------------

 
Small Group Meet Ups will be held twice a month targeting the public with an estimated five to ten attendees per session. The objective of these sessions is to encourage idea exchanges, to provide a platform for networking and potentially future collaboration opportunities, and foster better understanding between the participants and us, as well as among themselves.
 
Market Opportunities
 
We believe the main drivers for the growth of our business are the products and services together with the resources such as an office network, professional staff members and operational tools to make the advisory and consulting business more competitive.
 
We intend to assist our clients in the preparation of their financial statements cost-effectively and provide security to such financial information since the data will be stored in a cloud system. We anticipate a market with growing needs in Asia. We believe that there is currently an increasing need for enterprises in different industries to maximize their performance with cost-effective methods. We believe our services will create numerous competitive advantages for our clients. We believe that with us handling the administrative and logistic support, our clients can focus on developing their businesses and expanding their own client portfolio.
 
Customers
 
Our revenues are generated from clients located globally, including those from Hong Kong, China, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Australia, Japan, Taiwan, Russia and the United States. Our venture capital business will initially focus on Hong Kong and other Asian start-ups and high growth companies. We hope to generate deal flow through personal contacts of our management team as well as through our business incubator.
 
We generated revenues of $3,673,997 during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, and $2,949,780 during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. We are not a party to any long-term agreements with our customers.
 
Competition
 
We operate in a mature, competitive industry. We consider our focus to be on a niche market of small and medium-sized businesses. Competition in the general field of business advisory services is quite intense, particularly in Hong Kong. We face competition principally from established law firms and consulting service providers in the corporate finance industry, such as Marbury, King & Wood Mallesons, QMIS Financial Group, First Asia Finance Group Limited and their respective affiliates, as well as from certain accounting firms, including those that specialize in a tax planning and corporate restructuring. The competition in China and Malaysia is not as fierce as in Hong Kong. Our major competitors in China are JP Investment Group and QMIS Financial Group while our major competitors in Malaysia are Global Bridge Management Sdn. Bhd. and QMIS Financial Group. These competitors generate significant traffic and have established brand recognition and financial resources. New or existing competition that uses a business model that is different from our business model may pressure us to change so that we can remain competitive.
 
We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include quality of analysis; applicability and efficacy of recommendations; strength and depth of relationships with clients; ability to meet the changing needs of current and prospective clients; and service scope. By utilizing our competitive strengths, we believe that we have a competitive edge over other competitors due to the breadth of our service offerings, one stop convenience, pricing, marketing expertise, coverage network, service levels, track record, brand, and reputation. We are confident we can retain and enlarge our market share.

Intellectual Property
 
We intend to protect our investment in the research and development of our products and technologies. We intend to seek the widest possible protection for significant product and process developments in our major markets through a combination of trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights, and patents, if applicable. We anticipate that the form of protection will vary depending upon the level of protection afforded by a particular jurisdiction. Currently, our revenue is derived principally from our operations in Hong Kong, China and Malaysia, where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce. In such instances, we may seek protection of our intellectual property through measures taken to increase the confidentiality of intellectual property.
 
We have registered trademarks as a means of protecting the brand names of our companies and products. We intend to protect our trademarks against infringement, and also seek to register design protection where appropriate. Currently, there are six trademarks registered under the name of Greenpro Resources (HK) Limited.
 

Trademark | Trademark Owner | Country / Territory | Registration Date | Brief Description 
----------+-------------------------------------+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Greenpro Resources (HK) Limited | Hong Kong | August 11, 2010, June 25, 2013, and December 3, 2014 | Classes 35, 41, 42: Advertising, business management, business administration, office functions, research services, education, training 
 | | U.S.A. | February 2, 2016 | Class 35: Business administration services, business assistance, management and information services, business knowledge management and consulting services 
 | | China | December 28, 2014 | Classes 35 and 42: Advertising, business management, business administration, office functions and research services 
 | | Singapore | July 22, 2013 | Classes 35 and 42: Advisory services related to business management and administration, computer software and security 

 
We rely on trade secrets and un-patentable know-how that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements. Our policy is to require all employees to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual through individual’s relationship with us, to be kept confidential and do not disclose to third parties except in specific circumstances. The agreements also provide that all inventions conceived by the individual while rendering services to us shall be assigned to us as the exclusive property of our company. There can be no assurance, however, that all persons who we desire to sign such agreements will sign, or if they do, that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets or un-patentable know-how will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.
 
Government Regulation
 
We provide our Package Solution initially in Hong Kong, China and Malaysia, which we believe are locations that would need outsourcing support services. Further, we believe these markets are the central and regional markets for many customers doing cross border business in Asia. We target those customers from Asia doing international business and plan to provide our Package Solution to meet their needs. Our planned Package Solution will be structured in Hong Kong, but services may be outsourced to lower cost jurisdictions such as Malaysia and China, which encourage and welcome outsourcing services.

The following regulations are the laws and regulations that may be applicable to us:
 
Hong Kong
 
Our businesses located in Hong Kong are subject to the general laws in Hong Kong governing businesses, including labor, occupational safety and health, general corporations, intellectual property and other similar laws. Because our website is maintained through the server in Hong Kong, we expect that we will be required to comply with the rules and regulations and Hong Kong governing the data usage and regular terms of service applicable to our potential customers. As the information of our potential customers is preserved in Hong Kong, we will need to comply with the Hong Kong Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (Cap 486).
 
The Employment Ordinance is the main piece of legislation governing conditions of employment in Hong Kong. It covers a comprehensive range of employment protection and benefits for employees, including Wage Protection, Rest Days, Holiday Pay, Paid Annual Leave, Sickness Allowance, Maternity Protection, Statutory Paternity Leave, Severance Payment, Long Service Payment, Employment Protection, Termination of Employment Contract and Protection against Anti-Union Discrimination.
 
An employer must also comply with all legal obligations under the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance, (Cap 485). These include enrolling all qualifying employees in Mandatory Provident Fund (“MPF”) schemes and making MPF contributions for them. Except for exempt persons, employers should enroll both full-time and part-time employees who are at least 18 but under 65 years of age in an MPF scheme within the first 60 days of employment. The 60-day employment rule does not apply to casual employees in the construction and catering industries.
 
We are required to make MPF contributions for our Hong Kong employees once every contribution period (generally the wage period). Employers and employees are each required to make regular mandatory contributions of 5% of the employee’s relevant income to an MPF scheme, subject to the minimum and maximum relevant income levels. For a monthly-paid employee, the minimum and maximum relevant income levels are $7,100 and $30,000 respectively.
 
We comply with the above applicable ordinances and regulations in Hong Kong and have not been involved any lawsuit or prosecuted by the local authority resulting from any breach of the ordinances and regulations.
 
Malaysia
 
Our businesses located in Malaysia are subject to the general laws in Malaysia governing businesses including labor, occupational safety and health, general corporations, intellectual property and other similar laws including the Computer Crime Act 1997 and The Copyright (Amendment) Act 1997. We believe that the focus of these laws is censorship in Malaysia, however we believe this does not impact our businesses because the censorship focus is on media controls and does not relate to cloud base technology which we plan to use.
 
Our real estate investments are subject to extensive local, city, county and state rules and regulations regarding permitting, zoning, subdivision, utilities and water quality as well as federal rules and regulations regarding air and water quality and protection of endangered species and their habitats. Such regulation may result in higher than anticipated administrative and operational costs.
 
We comply with the above applicable ordinances and regulations in Malaysia and have not involved any lawsuit or prosecuted by the local authority resulting from any breach of the ordinances and regulations.
 
China
 
A portion of our acquired businesses located in China and subject to the general laws in China governing businesses including labor, occupational safety and health, general corporations, intellectual property and other similar laws.

Employment Contracts
 
The Employment Contract Law was promulgated by the National People’s Congress’ Standing Committee on June 29, 2007, and took effect on January 1, 2008. The Employment Contract Law governs labor relations and employment contracts (including the entry into, performance, amendment, termination, and determination of employment contracts) between domestic enterprises (including foreign-invested companies), individual economic organizations and private non-enterprise units (collectively referred to as the “employers”) and their employees
 
a. Execution of employment contracts
 
Under the Employment Contract Law, an employer is required to execute written employment contracts with its employees within one month from the commencement of employment. In the event of contravention, an employee is entitled to receive double salary for the period during which the employer fails to execute an employment contract. If an employer fails to execute an employment contract for more than 12 months from the commencement of the employee’s employment, an employment contract would be deemed to have been entered into between the employer and employee for a non-fixed term.
 
b. Right to non-fixed term contracts
 
Under the Employment Contract Law, an employee may request a non-fixed term contract without an employer’s consent to renew. In addition, an employee is also entitled to a non-fixed term contract with an employer if he has completed two fixed term employment contracts with such employer; however, such employee must not have committed any breach or have been subject to any disciplinary actions during his employment. Unless the employee requests to enter into a fixed term contract, an employer who fails to enter into a non-fixed term contract pursuant to the Employment Contract Law is liable to pay the employee double salary from the date the employment contract is renewed.
 
c. Compensation for termination or expiry of employment contracts
 
Under the Employment Contract Law, employees are entitled to compensation upon the termination or expiry of an employment contract. Employees are entitled to compensation even in the event the employer (i) has been declared bankrupt; (ii) has its business license revoked; (iii) has been ordered to cease or withdraw its business; or (iv) has been voluntarily liquidated. Where an employee has been employed for more than one year, the employee will be entitled to such compensation equivalent to one month’s salary for every completed year of service. Where an employee has been employed for less than one year, such employee will be deemed to have completed one full year of service.
 
d. Trade union and collective employment contracts
 
Under the Employment Contract Law, a trade union may seek arbitration and litigation to resolve any dispute arising from a collective employment contract provided that such dispute failed to be settled through negotiations. The Employment Contract Law also permits a trade union to enter into a collective employee contract with an employer on behalf of all the employees.
 
Where a trade union has not been formed, a representative appointed under the recommendation of a high-level trade union may execute the collective employment contract. Within districts below county level, collective employment contracts for industries such as those engaged in construction, mining, food and beverage and those from the service sector, etc., may be executed on behalf of employees by the representatives from the trade union of each respective industry. Alternatively, a district-based collective employment contract may be made.
 
As a result of the Employment Contract Law, all our employees have executed standard written employment agreements with us. We have not experienced any significant labor disputes or any difficulties in recruiting staff for our operations.

On October 28, 2010, the National People’s Congress of China promulgated the PRC Social Insurance Law, which became effective on July 1, 2011. In accordance with the PRC Social Insurance Law, the Interim Regulations on the Collection and Payment of Social Security Fund and other relevant laws and regulations, China establishes a social insurance system including basic pension insurance, basic medical insurance, work-related injury insurance, unemployment insurance and maternity insurance. An employer shall pay the social insurance for its employees in accordance with the rates provided under relevant regulations and shall withhold the social insurance that should be assumed by the employees. The authorities in charge of social insurance may request an employer’s compliance and impose sanctions if such employer fails to pay and withhold social insurance in a timely manner. Under the Regulations on the Administration of Housing Fund effective in 1999, as amended in 2002, PRC companies must register with applicable housing fund management centers and establish a special housing fund account in an entrusted bank. Both PRC companies and their employees are required to contribute to the housing funds.
 
The Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security promulgated the Interim Provisions on Labor Dispatch on January 24, 2014. The Interim Provisions on Labor Dispatch, which became effective on March 1, 2014, sets forth that labor dispatch should only be applicable to temporary, auxiliary or substitute positions. Temporary positions shall mean positions subsisting for no more than six months, auxiliary positions shall mean positions of non-major business that serve positions of major businesses, and substitute positions shall mean positions that can be held by substitute employees for a certain period of time during which the employees who originally hold such positions are unable to work as a result of full-time study, being on leave or other reasons. The Interim Provisions further provides that, the number of the dispatched workers of an employer shall not exceed 10% of its total workforce, and the total workforce of an employer shall refer to the sum of the number of the workers who have executed labor contracts with the employer and the number of workers who are dispatched to the employer.
 
Foreign Exchange Control and Administration
 
Foreign exchange in China is primarily regulated by:
 

● | The Foreign Currency Administration Rules (1996), as amended; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The Administration Rules of the Settlement, Sale and Payment of Foreign Exchange (1996), or the Administration Rules. 

 
Under the Foreign Currency Administration Rules, if documents certifying the purposes of the conversion of RMB into foreign currency are submitted to the relevant foreign exchange conversion bank, the RMB will be convertible for current account items, including the distribution of dividends, interest and royalty payments, and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions. Conversion of RMB for capital account items, such as direct investment, loans, securities investment and repatriation of investment, however, is subject to the approval of SAFE or its local counterpart.
 
Under the Administration Rules for the Settlement, Sale and Payment of Foreign Exchange, foreign-invested enterprises may only buy, sell and/or remit foreign currencies at banks authorized to conduct foreign exchange business after providing valid commercial documents and, in the case of capital account item transactions, obtaining approval from SAFE or its local counterpart.
 
As an offshore holding company with PRC subsidiaries, we may (i) make additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries, (ii) establish new PRC subsidiaries and make capital contributions to these new PRC subsidiaries, (iii) make loans to our PRC subsidiaries or consolidated affiliated entities, or (iv) acquire offshore entities with business operations in China in offshore transactions. However, most of these uses are subject to PRC regulations and approvals. For example:
 

● | Capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries, whether existing or newly established ones, must be approved by the Ministry of Commerce or its local counterparts; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Loans by us to our PRC subsidiaries, each of which is a foreign-invested enterprise, to finance their activities cannot exceed statutory limits and must be registered with SAFE or its local branches; and 
● | Loans by us to our consolidated affiliated entities, which are domestic PRC entities, must be approved by the National Development and Reform Commission and must also be registered with SAFE or its local branches.

On August 29, 2008, SAFE promulgated the Circular on the Relevant Operating Issues concerning the Improvement of the Administration of Payment and Settlement of Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign-invested Enterprises, or “Circular 142”.
 
On March 30, 2015, SAFE issued the Circular of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange Concerning Reform of the Administrative Approaches to Settlement of Foreign Exchange Capital of Foreign-invested Enterprises, or “Circular 19”, which became effective on June 1, 2015, to regulate the conversion by foreign invested enterprises, or FIEs, of foreign currency into RMB by restricting how the converted RMB may be used. Circular 19 requires that RMB converted from the foreign currency-dominated capital of a FIE shall be managed under the Accounts for FX settlement and pending payment. The expenditure scope of such Accounts includes expenditure within the business scope, payment of funds for domestic equity investment and RMB deposits, repayment of the RMB loans after completed utilization and so forth.
 
A FIE shall truthfully use its capital by itself within the business scope and shall not, directly or indirectly, use its capital or RMB converted from the foreign currency-dominated capital for (i) expenditure beyond its business scope or expenditure prohibited by laws or regulations, (ii) disbursing RMB entrusted loans (unless permitted under its business scope), repaying inter-corporate borrowings (including third-party advance) and repaying RMB bank loans already refinanced to any third party. Where a FIE, other than a foreign-invested investment company, foreign-invested venture capital enterprise or foreign-invested equity investment enterprise, makes domestic equity investment by transferring its capital in the original currency, it shall obey the current provisions on domestic re-investment. Where such a FIE makes domestic equity investment by its RMB conversion, the invested enterprise shall first go through domestic re-investment registration and open a corresponding Accounts for FX settlement and pending payment, and the FIE shall thereafter transfer the conversion to the aforesaid Account according to the actual amount of investment.
 
In addition, according to the Regulations of the People’s Republic of China on Foreign Exchange Administration, which became effective on August 5, 2008, the use of foreign exchange or RMB conversion may not be changed without authorization.
 
Violations of the applicable circulars and rules may result in severe penalties, including substantial fines as set forth in the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations.
 
In light of the various requirements imposed by PRC regulations on loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding companies, we cannot assure you that we will always be able to complete the necessary government registrations or obtain the necessary government approvals on a timely basis, if at all, with respect to future loans to our PRC subsidiaries or future capital contributions by us to our PRC subsidiaries. If we fail to complete such registrations or obtain such approvals, our ability to capitalize or otherwise fund our PRC operations may be negatively affected, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business.
 
Currently, we are following the above applicable ordinances and regulations in China and have not involved any lawsuit or prosecuted by the local authority resulting from any breach of the ordinances and regulations.
 
Insurance
 
We do not current maintain property, business interruption and casualty insurance. As our business matures, we expect to obtain such insurance in accordance with customary industry practices in Malaysia, Hong Kong and China, as applicable.
Seasonality
 
Our businesses are not subject to seasonality.

Future Development Plan
 
We are in the process of carrying out the following development plans.
 

1. | Expansion of Corporate Finance Services: 
---+---------------------------------------------

 
We plan to further expand our corporate finance services business. Our corporate finance services include financial advisory services relating to listings in the US capital markets (e.g., NASDAQ and OTC Markets) and listings in Hong Kong, mergers and acquisitions, investment valuation, project management and other financial advisory services. We intend to enhance our corporate finance business in China, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Thailand, by engaging in more marketing activities and expanding our business network to these regions.
 

2. | ADAQ Development: 
---+----------------------

 
ADAQ is a next generation online financial information platform which facilitates connecting private high growth emerging companies with access to potential investors and synergetic companies. ADAQ is dedicated to equip emerging growth companies in the Asia Pacific region with the guidance and information to identify, build and stream their sustainable core values. In addition, it offers an acceleration program to incubate and assist companies to accelerate the process by which they seek to list on international exchanges such as New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), NASDAQ and Hong Kong Stock Exchange (“HKEX”).
 

● | ADAQ has three major functions: 
--+------------------------------------

1. Corporate Value Building Program
 2. Online platform and acceleration process to International Capital Market Listing
 3. Online Financial Information Market
 
We intend to strengthen the development of ADAQ as an acceleration platform to assist high growth emerging companies in the ASEAN regions covering Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam, and China to obtain funding and prepare for an IPO. An increasing number of companies across South-East Asia and the Greater Bay Area are interested in listing on the ADAQ market platform. We believe the successful development of the platform will heighten the prospects of Greenpro’s venture capital projects, aiming to achieve success and to widen market coverage to source for new potential projects.

● | Wealth Management Portfolio Development. The increase in the number of high-net-worth individuals in the Asia Pacific Region has created opportunities and needs for cross-border wealth management services. Leveraging our competitive advantages with integrated financial services and strategic offices, we look forward to enhancing our strategic development in wealth management, fund management and asset management businesses. We continue to look for partnerships to explore the potential of wealth management, fund management and asset management services, and provide with the assistance from our affiliates customized wealth creation, wealth protection and wealth succession solutions for medium, high and ultra-high net worth individuals/families in the Asian region. We also expect to place more efforts into the development of our Wealth Network Database focusing on wealth related information sharing.

In addition, we plan to continue to grow through mergers and acquisitions of related services to enhance our services horizontally and vertically.
