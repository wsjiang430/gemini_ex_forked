Our Corporate History
 Information Systems Associates, Inc. (“ISA”) was incorporated in Florida on May 31, 1994. Our original business operations consisted of consulting services for asset management of large corporate data centers and the development and licensing of information technology (“IT”) asset management software. In late 2014, ISA entered negotiations with Duos Technologies, Inc. (“duostech™”) for the purposes of executing a merger between the two organizations (also known as a “reverse triangular merger”). Incorporated under the laws of Florida on November 30, 1990, duostech™ operated in various industry segments, specializing in the design, development and deployment of proprietary technology applications and turn-key engineered systems. This transaction was completed on April 1, 2015, whereby duostech™ became a wholly owned subsidiary of ISA. After the merger was completed, ISA changed its corporate name to Duos Technologies Group, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “Duos,” “we,” “us” or the “Company”). The Company, based in Jacksonville, Florida, oversees its wholly owned subsidiary, duostech™ and employs approximately 75 people and is a technology company which designs, develops, deploys and operates intelligent technology solutions with a focus on software applications and artificial intelligence (“AI”). The company has a strong portfolio of intellectual property. The Company’s headquarters are located at 7660 Centurion Parkway, Suite 100, Jacksonville, Florida 32256 and main telephone number is (904) 296-2807.
Overview
 
The Company, operating under its brand name duostech, develops and deploys technology systems with focus on inspecting and evaluating moving vehicles. Its technology focus is within the Vision Technology market sector and, more specifically, the Machine Vision subsector. Machine Vision companies provide imaging-based automatic inspection and analysis for process control for industry with potential expansion into other markets. Duos has developed key technologies over the past several years in software, industry specific hardware and artificial intelligence and has demonstrated industrial strength usability of its systems supporting rail, logistics and intermodal businesses that streamline operations, improve safety and reduce costs. Our team includes engineering subject matter expertise in hardware, software, and information technology as well as industry specific applications of artificial intelligence also referred to as Expert Artificial Intelligence. We also have specific industry experts on staff and as consultants in the rail industry.
 
Duos is currently developing industry solutions for its target markets which will address rail, trucking, aviation and other vehicle-based processes. Duos’ initial offering, the Railcar Inspection Portal (RIP), provides both freight and transit railroad customers and select government agencies the ability to conduct fully automated railcar inspections of trains while they are moving at full speed. The RIP utilizes a variety of sophisticated optical, laser and speed sensors to scan each passing railcar to create a high-resolution image-set of the top, sides and undercarriage. These images are then processed with our edge data center using artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to identify safety and security defects on each railcar. The algorithms are developed in conjunction with industrial application experts, in this case resident Railcar Mechanical Engineers, to provide specific guidance in the analysis (“human in the loop”). Within minutes of the railcar passing through the RIP, a detailed report is sent to the customer where they are able to action identified issues. This solution has the potential to transform the railroad industry by increasing safety, improving efficiency and reducing costs. The Company has already deployed this system with several Class 1 railroads and anticipates an increased demand from transit and other railroad customers along with selected government agencies that operate and/or manage rail traffic. The Company has deployed RIPs in Canada, Mexico and the United States and anticipates expanding this solution into Europe, Asia and the Middle East in coming years.
 
The Company has also developed the Automated Logistics Information System (ALIS) which automates gatehouse operations where transport trucks enter and exit large logistics and intermodal facilities. This solution incorporates a similar set of sensors, data processing and artificial intelligence to streamline the customer’s logistics transactions and tracking and can also automate the security and safety inspection if called for. The Company has already deployed this system with one large North American retailer and anticipates increased demand from other large retailers, railroad intermodal operators and select government agencies that manage logistics and border crossing points. The Company is evaluating other solutions for moving vehicles including aircraft, which could provide similar benefits in terms of safety and efficiency for required inspections as part of an operations process.

We have developed two proprietary solutions that operate our software and artificial intelligence. centraco® is an Enterprise Information Management Software platform that consolidates data and events from multiple sources into a unified and distributive user interface. Customized to the end user’s Concept of Operations (CONOPS), it provides improved situational awareness and data visualization for operational objectives compared to traditional manual inspections. truevue360™ is our fully integrated platform that we utilize to develop and deploy Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms, including Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Object Detection and Deep Neural Network-based processing for real-time applications.
 
These same Artificial Intelligence applications have begun to open up other opportunities for the Company to provide revenue producing solutions with potentially high market adoption.
 
In 2021, the Company ended support of its IT Asset Management (ITAM) solution which cataloged results for data center asset inventory and audit services. We are currently evaluating using our current operations experience within “edge data centers” (as deployed for our Railcar Inspection Portal) to drive additional revenues within other markets requiring this type of solution although no specific offering has been developed at this time.
 
In the last quarter of 2022, the Company elected not to renew a support contract for its Integrated Correctional Automation System (iCAS) for one customer. The Company is currently looking to sell the assets related to that business but due to the limited nature of this business, any impact is not expected to be material.
 
The year 2022 ushered in a new phase in the Company’s development. Although we continue to see an extension of challenges faced in 2021, we also see positive changes and opportunities for our business that will be discussed in greater detail later in this report. They include:
 

· | Introducing a new “subscription” based offering for access to data and images by a much broader target market including Class 1 railroads, railcar owners and lessors, short line railroads.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Owning and operating a network of RIPs with multiple subscribers outside of the Company’s traditional customer base.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Selling customized RIPs to Class 1, Short-line and other industrial companies where specialized applications or routes demand a bespoke solution.

Railcar Inspection Portal (rip®)
 
Federal regulations require each railcar/train to be inspected for mechanical defects prior to leaving a rail yard. Founded in 1934, the Association of American Railroads (AAR) is responsible for setting the standards for the safety and productivity of the U.S./North American freight rail industry, and by extension, has established the inspection parameters for the rail industry’s rolling stock. Also known as the “Why Made” codes, the AAR established approximately 110 inspection points under its guidelines for mechanical inspections.
 
Under current practice, inspections are conducted manually, a very labor intensive and inefficient process that only covers a select number of inspection points and can take several hours per train. We believe our Railcar Inspection Portal has the potential to reduce this inspection to minutes while the train is moving at speed improving safety, reducing dwell time and optimizing maintenance.

Our system combines high-definition image and data capture technologies with our AI-based analytics applications that are typically installed on active tracks located between two rail yards. We inspect railcars traveling through our inspection portal at speeds of up to 70 mph and report mechanical anomalies detected by our system to the inbound train yard, well ahead of the train entering the yard.
 
Currently, three Class 1 railroads and several transit and international railroads use our rip® technology with one of those railroads broadly deploying the technology across its network. 
 
The Company continues to expand its detection capabilities through the development and integration of additional sensor technologies to include laser, infrared, thermal, sound and x-ray to process AI-based analytics of inspection points. As of early 2023, the Company has a high-reliability catalog of over 30 artificial intelligence algorithms which can be integrated into the RIP to enhance mechanical anomalies detections. These detections support railroads in the active maintenance and overall safety of their railcar fleet and networks.
 
Markets
 
We believe the opportunity for our Railcar Inspection Portal business is substantial and continues to be our number one priority. We are currently engaged with the RIP solution with three of seven Class 1 railroad operators with 13 systems already deployed across the North American rail network. Because of our early leadership position, we have been able to accumulate experience and intellectual property that we believe would be time consuming and expensive for a new competitor to replicate. Furthermore, we believe we have the ability to upgrade and scale our solutions with additional technologies in the future. We believe that the current market for our technologies is substantial. At the same time, we recognize that the technology life cycle is fast and evolving. Potential competitors could move into this sector, and it is possible that some Class 1 railroads could develop their own solutions that limit our total addressable market.
 
In late 2022, the Company announced it will pursue a subscription platform for the Railcar Inspection Portals (“RIPs”). Under this new model, the Company will build, own and operate its RIP product and offer the data access for each portal to potential customers. This expansion of the RIP offering would potentially open up the addressable market to other railroads, railcar owners, and car lessors. This shift increases the pool of potential customers by lowering the entry point for the RIP and would reshape the Company’s working capital needs to invest in the construction of a RIP ahead of customer revenue inflows. The Company continues to explore this expansion on the long-term effects it may have on future cash flows.
 
Another market we are pursuing as our second priority is using our Automated Logistics and Information Systems solution (alis™). Potential customers include commercial retail logistics and intermodal operators, Class 1 rail intermodal operators that are moving large amounts of automobiles, and U.S. Government agencies such as the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security. Today, we currently have 20 production systems in use, but we believe the greenfield opportunity here to be substantial. We have identified over 900 lanes of traffic within nearly 300 facilities as potential business opportunities in the near-term.
 
Currently, we are focused on the North American market, but plan to expand globally in the future with interest from Europe, Asia and the Middle East.
 
Patents and Trademarks
 
The Company holds a number of patents and trademarks for our technology solutions. We protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state, and common law rights, as well as contractual restrictions. We control access to our proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with all of our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with third parties. We also actively engage in monitoring activities with respect to infringing uses of our intellectual property by third parties.

Specific Areas of Competition
 
One of our primary commercial goals is to develop innovative technology solutions and target potential “greenfield” market spaces in order to maximize our business footprint and give us the ability to help define the market parameters for the future.
 
Other companies that participate in the visual and optical (laser) based railcar inspection systems market include Wabtec (Beena Vision), KLD Labs, WID, IEM, and Camlin Rail. Some Class 1 railroads have stated that they are developing “in-house” solutions. We believe that Duos has a significant competitive advantage in that we have multiple years of deployment experience, have access to millions of images where our RIP has performed scans with AI analysis and in-house industry expertise to train our systems and make identification of common problems more automated.
 
Our Automated Logistics Information System (ALIS) also represents an opportunity to expand into a mature market that we believe has a significant technology gap.  While most facilities, such as distribution centers, that process commercial trucks in and out have sophisticated software management applications for logistics control, they have most often not implemented an advanced gatehouse automation solution. Historically, this category was referred to as “Automated Gate Systems” or AGS.  The purpose of AGS technology is to streamline entry in to and exit out of facilities.  The marketplace for this was mostly seaports and intermodal transfer facilities and was relatively expensive technology to deploy.

Organic Growth
 
Our organic growth strategy is to continue our focus and prioritization in the rail, logistics and intermodal market space. In this regard, the Company has made significant changes in the senior management team to include a new Chief Executive Officer, who joined the Company in 2022 and has years of experience successfully leading start-up and turn-around companies. In addition, a key account executive from one of duos’ competitors has joined the executive team during late 2022 as the Senior Vice President of Sales & Marketing to support the continued revenue growth of the business and brings with him over 20 years of sales experience focused in the rail market. In 2021, the Company also hired a new Chief Technology Officer bringing 25 years of experience in designing and delivering on value driven technologies. Our new CTO has already led the team through instrumental changes to its approach to software and artificial intelligence development. The team also saw a change in CFO in late 2022 who brings significant experience in growth for asset-intensive businesses which aligns with the subscription format the Company will expand into.
 
The new leadership team’s focus is to improve operational and technical execution which will in turn enable the commercial side of the business to expand RIP and ALIS delivery into existing customers. Even though supply chain issues are expected to continue through 2023, the Company’s primary customers have indicated readiness to order more equipment and services based upon the Company’s current performance and the new subscription offerings expands the universe of potential customers.
 
Additionally, the CEO has directed that the Company make continual engineering and software upgrades to the RIP to meet anticipated Federal Railroad Association (FRA) and Association of American Railroad (AAR) standards.
 
Manufacturing and Assembly
 
The Company designs and develops technology solutions using a combination of in-house fabrication, commercial off-the-shelf technology, and outsourced manufacturing. On-site installations are performed using a combination of in-house project managers and engineers and using third-party sub-contractors as needed. Throughout the process of design, develop, deploy and operate, the Company maintains responsibility for all aspects. Our internal manufacturing operations consist primarily of materials procurement, assembly, testing and quality control by our engineers. If not manufactured internally, we use third-party manufacturing partners to produce our hardware related components and hardware products and we most often complete final assembly, testing and quality control processes for these components and products. Our manufacturing processes are based on standardization of components across product types, centralization of assembly and distribution centers, and a “build-to-order” methodology in which products generally are built only after customers have placed firm orders. For most of our hardware products, we have existing alternate sources of supply.
 
For 2023 and possibly beyond, we expect to face significant challenges with macro-economic impacts, specifically inflation and supply chain disruption. Although these started to be identified in late 2021, we believe they continue to manifest themselves in ways that could challenge our business growth in the future. Specifically, the ability to source key components and certain implementation services will dictate just how quickly the Company can meet desired installation deadlines. In the industries in which we operate, the time from concept to contract can be substantial. Although we are now adapting to these challenges, previous bids that have been submitted could be challenging to execute within the financial framework and execution times originally envisaged. We continue to have dialogue with our customers regarding potential price increases and implementation delays, but we may suffer some economic impacts as a result of this. Revenue recognition could be delayed as a result of these factors and profitability could be impacted due to higher costs for materials and other services. The Company will continue to monitor the situation and update shareholders as the situation unfolds.
 
Research and Development 
 
The Company’s R&D and software development teams design and develop all systems and software applications with a combination of full-time in-house software engineers and outside contractors. Internal development allows us to maintain technical control over the design and development of our products. Rapid technological advances in hardware and software development, evolving standards in computer hardware and software technology, and changing customer requirements characterize the markets in which we compete. We plan to continue to dedicate significant resources to research and development efforts, including software development, to maintain and improve our current product and services offerings.

Government Regulations
 
The Company has worked with various agencies of the federal government for more than 10-years including the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). When our solutions have been deployed into these agencies, they meet specific requirements for certification, safety and security that are stipulated in requirements and contract documents. The Company is currently competing for other government related work and strictly follows the rules and regulations outlined in the Federal Acquisition Regulations.
 
The Company’s primary customers are all governed by regulations related to the safe and effective transportation of goods, primarily by rail, but in future scenarios by air, road and sea. While changes in the regulatory environment could impact the Company in future years, we believe any changes will be overall positive for the Company. We continuously review potential changes in the regulatory environment and maintain contact with key personnel at certain agencies including the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), the Transportation Safety Agency (TSA) as well as the DHS previously mentioned. We expect to develop similar relationships with governmental agencies in target market both in the US and internationally. At this time, we believe our offerings are complementary to the current and evolving standards and that we will adapt to any new regulations as they are promulgated.
 
Employees
 
We have a current staff of 75 employees, of which 67 are full-time, the majority of which work in the Jacksonville area, none of which are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
