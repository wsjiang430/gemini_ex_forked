GENERAL

Express, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (“Express” or the “Company”), is a fashion retail company whose business includes an omnichannel operating platform, physical and online stores, and a multi-brand portfolio that includes Express and UpWest. The Express brand launched in 1980 with the idea that style, quality and value should all be found in one place. Today, Express is a brand with a purpose - We Create Confidence. We Inspire Self-Expression. - powered by a styling community. UpWest launched in 2019 with a purpose to Provide Comfort for People & Planet.
As of January 28, 2023, we operated 553 stores across the United States and in Puerto Rico, including 198 factory outlet stores. Our stores are located primarily in high-traffic shopping malls, lifestyle centers, outlet centers, and street locations, and average approximately 8,200 gross square feet. We also sell our products through our online store, www.express.com, our mobile app, as well as through franchisees who operate Express locations in Latin America pursuant to franchise agreements. Our 2022 merchandise sales were comprised of 92% apparel and 8% accessories and other and 52% women's and 48% men's.
WHP Strategic Partnership
On December 8, 2022, we entered into a strategic partnership with WHP Global (“WHP”), a leading global brand management firm. The mutually transformative strategic partnership advances our omnichannel platform which is expected to drive accelerated, long-term growth through the acquisition and operation of a portfolio of brands. The Company and WHP also formed EXP Topco, LLC, an intellectual property joint venture (the “Joint Venture”), intended to scale the Express brand through new domestic category licensing and international expansion opportunities. Refer to Note 4 included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion regarding the WHP partnership.

COMPETITION AND COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS

The apparel retail market is highly competitive. We compete with other omni-channel retailers that engage in the retail sale of women's and men's apparel, accessories, and similar merchandise. We compete on the basis of a combination of factors, including, among others, style, breadth, quality, and price of merchandise offered, in-store and online customer experience, and brand image. 
We believe we differentiate ourselves from our competitors as follows:
•Established Lifestyle Brand
With more than 40 years of heritage, we are a fashion-forward apparel brand and style community whose purpose is to create confidence and inspire self-expression. From wardrobe essentials to the latest trends, we outfit doers, makers, movers and shakers with clothing designed for real-life versatility. At Express, we believe that everyone should dream big and dress accordingly. Our clothing is an edit of the top trends to 
EXPRESS, INC. | 2022 Form 10-K | 7


create a modern, flexible wardrobe. The Express brand differentiates itself by offering terrific value, great fits, premium fabrics and impeccable details, with each style designed to help you express your style.
•Reengineered Go To Market Processes
We implemented our new go to market process in the Spring of 2020 and our teams have been better aligned, our products speed to market has increased, and we have better cross functional coordination in the field and at the home office. This transformed process began with a unified brand presentation increasing our speed to market, streamlining our calendars, and ensuring better integration across all of our marketing touchpoints. We have achieved our goal of being more efficient, more effective, and more connected across functions and faster to market at a reduced cost. We have also worked more closely with our suppliers to achieve better alignment on the aesthetics, fit and quality our customers want. All of these efforts continue to help us bring more newness in our assortment more often and mitigate the supply chain challenges facing us today.
•Strong and Experienced Team
Our existing team, at and below the leadership level, has extensive experience in the retail apparel industry, including depth in the areas of fashion design and merchandising, supply chain management, marketing, customer experience, eCommerce, store operations, technology, planning and allocation, and real estate, as well as other diverse business experiences that we believe are valuable to us as we continue to execute our growth strategy. Experience within Express extends deep into our organization, including district and store managers.

OUR PRODUCTS

The majority of our apparel designs are created by our in-house design team. We believe every day is an occasion and we want to help our customers dress for it. We established a design and merchandising philosophy called the Express Edit that supports our brand promise: “to edit the best of now for real life versatility”. We are designing best-in-class, modern product at incredible value. Below are the four ideas that define the Express Edit merchandising philosophy:
•Versatility Adds Value
◦Create modern-day dressing experience with multiple ways to wear at work, at play, during the day and during the night
•New & Now
◦Meet our customers’ desire for newness by understanding where fashion is now and looking ahead to where it's going through monthly deliveries in key categories that continue to update a seasonal wardrobe
•Drive Denim
◦Denim is the foundation of every modern wardrobe. We completely reinvented our assortments and are delivering premium jeans under $100
•Add an Accessory
◦Accessories are a fashion entry point and an add-on to an outfit at an opening price point
We plan our product assortments and display them in our stores and online in a coordinated manner to encourage our customers to purchase items that can be worn in multiple ways for multiple wearing occasions. We believe this allows us to better meet our customers' shopping objectives while differentiating our product offerings from competitors. On average, our customers purchase two to three items per transaction.

OMNICHANNEL CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE

We are committed to enhancing our omnichannel customer experience that offers a seamless shopping experience whether the customer is shopping in a store or online through a desktop, tablet, or mobile device. The mutually transformative strategic partnership with WHP advances the Company's omnichannel platform and we expect the 
EXPRESS, INC. | 2022 Form 10-K | 8


partnership with WHP to drive accelerated, long-term growth through the acquisition and operation of a portfolio of brands. We believe the lines between our store and eCommerce channels are disappearing as customers increasingly interact with us both in-store and online and often through mobile devices while in stores. As a result, we are focused on leveraging the best of both channels to create an exceptional omnichannel shopping experience.
We design our stores to create a distinctive and engaging shopping environment and project our image of Express as a fashion authority. Our stores feature a vibrant and youthful look, bright signage and popular music. Our stores are constructed and finished to allow us to efficiently shift merchandise displays throughout the year as seasons dictate. To further enhance our customers' experience, we seek to attract enthusiastic store associates who are committed to offering a high level of customer service. We believe our managers and associates are well equipped to assist and inspire our customers as a result of education and training we provide, the culture of accountability we foster, the incentives we offer, and the decision-making authority we grant to store managers. On average, our store managers have been with Express for approximately six years.
Similar to our stores, our eCommerce capabilities focus on creating an engaging and easy shopping experience that supports a vibrant fashion consumer, whether on a mobile device, tablet, or desktop, with a particular focus on the mobile experience. We recognize the growing preference for online shopping and continue to make enhancements to the online customer experience through improved search, site navigation and checkout capabilities, and targeted customer messaging, making shopping easier for customers.

MARKETING

We use a variety of marketing vehicles designed to acquire new customers, engage with existing customers, increase customer traffic in-store and online, and build brand loyalty. We seek to optimize our customer relationship management ("CRM") through a number of tactics, such as test and learn programs, circulation and offer models, and greater use of digital marketing.
We use a proprietary customer database, together with data analytics, to customize our communications and make targeted offers to customers in an effort to increase customer traffic in-store and online and to increase conversion. During the first quarter of 2021, we rebranded and relaunched our Express Insider loyalty program and we ended 2022 with the highest number of active loyalty members in the Company's history.
We implemented new participation tiers and earnings structure, new benefits, a digital wallet feature, and made it easier for customers to earn, track, and redeem their benefits. Our Express Insider members have tremendous lifetime value to Express. This program is a critical factor in gaining additional share of existing customers' spend and bringing new customers into the brand. We also offer a private-label credit card through an agreement (the "Card Agreement") with Comenity Bank (the “Bank”) under which the Bank owns the credit card accounts and Alliance Data Systems Corporation provides services to our private-label credit card customers. All of our proprietary credit cards carry the Express logo.

TECHNOLOGY

We rely on information technology to operate our business. Our information technology provides a full range of business process support and information to our store, eCommerce, merchandising, financial and real estate teams. We utilize a combination of customized and industry standard software systems to provide various functions related to point-of-sale, inventory management, design, planning and allocation, and financial reporting. In addition, we continue to enhance and upgrade our online experience through both the web and our mobile app. We believe these systems and enhancements will continue to increase our ability to acquire and retain customers and ultimately accelerate our transformation from a store in the mall to a brand with a purpose powered by a styling community.

SOURCING

Our Sourcing Methods
We utilize a broad base of manufacturers located throughout the world that we believe produce goods at the level of quality that our customers desire and can supply products to us on a timely basis at competitive prices. We do not 
EXPRESS, INC. | 2022 Form 10-K | 9


own or operate any manufacturing facilities and, as a result, contract with third-party vendors for the production of all of our merchandise. We purchase both apparel and accessories through buying agents and directly from vendors. In exchange for a commission, our buying agents identify suitable vendors and coordinate our purchasing requirements with vendors by placing orders for merchandise on our behalf, facilitating the timely delivery of goods to us, obtaining samples of merchandise produced in factories, inspecting finished merchandise, and carrying out vendor compliance monitoring and administrative communications on our behalf.
We purchase the majority of our merchandise outside of the United States through arrangements with approximately 60 vendors utilizing approximately 220 manufacturing facilities located in approximately 20 countries throughout the world, primarily in Asia. The top five countries from which we sourced our merchandise in 2022 were Vietnam, China, Indonesia, India and Bangladesh, based on total cost of merchandise purchased. The top 10 manufacturing facilities, based on cost, supplied approximately 26% of our merchandise in 2022. We purchase merchandise using purchase orders, and therefore are not subject to long-term production contracts with any vendors, manufacturers, or buying agents.
Quality Assurance and Compliance Monitoring
Each supplier, factory, and subcontractor that manufactures our merchandise is required to adhere to our Code of Vendor Conduct and certain other purchasing terms and conditions, including those related to product quality. This is designed to ensure that each of our suppliers' operations are conducted in a legal, ethical, and responsible manner. Our Code of Vendor Conduct requires that each of our suppliers provides minimum wages and benefits, limits working hours, complies with all laws, including environmental laws, and provides a safe and healthy work environment. It also forbids the use of child labor or forced labor, and prohibits unauthorized subcontracting. We monitor compliance through third parties who conduct regular factory audits on our behalf as well as through our buying agents.

DISTRIBUTION

We utilize two facilities for the distribution of our product, both of which are owned and operated by third parties. Virtually all of the merchandise sold in our stores and on our website is first received and processed at a central distribution facility in Columbus, Ohio. From there, merchandise allocated to be sold in stores is shipped to our stores and merchandise to be sold online direct-to-consumer is shipped to a distribution facility in Richwood, Kentucky (the "Richwood Facility"). Merchandise is typically shipped to such stores and to the Richwood Facility via third-party delivery services multiple times per week, thereby providing them with a steady flow of inventory. The third party who operates the Richwood Facility is responsible for fulfilling the majority of the orders placed through our website and shipping the merchandise directly to customers or to stores for pickup, via third-party delivery services. In addition, approximately 318 retail stores have the ability to ship select online merchandise directly to our customers.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

The Express trademark and certain variations thereon, such as Express World Brand, are registered or are subject to pending trademark applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and/or with the registries of many foreign countries. In addition, the Express trademarks are used in many registered domain names, including express.com. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we sold certain intellectual property to the Joint Venture, and received a license back to such intellectual property under the Intellectual Property License Agreement discussed further below.
Intellectual Property License Agreement 
In connection with the strategic partnership with WHP, we entered into an Intellectual Property License Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with the Joint Venture. The License Agreement provides us with an exclusive license in 
EXPRESS, INC. | 2022 Form 10-K | 11


the United States to the intellectual property we contributed pursuant to the membership interest purchase agreement entered into by and among the Company, WHP and Express LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Membership Interest Purchase Agreement”) and certain other intellectual property. The initial term of the License Agreement is 10 years, and the License Agreement automatically renews for successive renewal terms of 10 years (unless we provide notice of non-renewal at least 24 months prior to the end of the initial or applicable renewal term). Except for our right not to renew the License Agreement, the License Agreement is not terminable by either party. Pursuant to the License Agreement, we are required to pay actual royalties at a rate of (i) 3.25% of net sales arising from retail sales of certain licensed goods in the first through the fifth contract years (and 3.5% thereafter), and (ii) 8% of net sales arising from wholesale sales of such goods. Cash earnings in the Joint Venture are distributed quarterly to both the Company and WHP on a pro rata basis. Refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources,” Note 2, Note 4 and Note 8 in our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.

REGULATION AND LEGISLATION

We are subject to labor and employment laws and regulations, including minimum wage requirements; intellectual property laws; consumer protection laws and regulations, including those governing advertising and promotions, privacy, and product safety; laws and regulations with respect to the operation of our stores and business generally, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; and laws that apply as a result of being a public company. In addition, we are subject to United States customs laws and similar laws of other countries associated with the import and export of merchandise.

HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES

At Express our brand purpose is to create confidence and inspire self-expression, and our associates are essential to fulfilling that purpose. In order to compete and succeed in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market, we must continue to attract and retain talented and experienced employees. To do this, we begin with a comprehensive, Company-wide program called Success@Express that guides our approach to associate performance, potential and succession, and rewards. Success@Express also ensures that each associate’s goals and objectives are aligned with the EXPRESSway Forward strategy.
Associates
We currently employ approximately 11,000 associates. Approximately 900 associates are based at our corporate locations in either Columbus or New York City, approximately 40 are field-based regional and district managers, approximately 1,000 are in-store managers and assistant managers, and approximately 9,000 are in-store sales associates. Approximately 30% of our associates are full-time and the remaining 70% are part-time. We employ temporary, seasonal associates at times, primarily during peak holiday selling periods. None of our associates are represented by a union. We believe our relations with our associates are good. 
Compensation and Benefits
The compensation and benefits component of the Success@Express program is designed to attract and reward individuals who demonstrate the skills necessary to support our business objectives, assist in the achievement of our strategic goals and create long-term value for our shareholders. We provide associates with compensation packages that include base salary and may also include annual incentive bonuses and/or long-term incentive awards depending upon the associate’s level. We believe that a compensation program with both short-term and long-term awards provides fair and competitive compensation and aligns associate and stockholder interests. In addition to cash and equity compensation, we also offer eligible associates benefits such as life and health (medical, dental and vision) insurance, paid time off, paid parental leave, and a 401(k) plan, of which we match 4.0% of contributions.
We offer Flex@Express which empowers associates to work with their leaders to create flexible work arrangements that best balance their personal and professional commitments.

Board Oversight
Human capital management is incorporated into discussions of our Board of Directors throughout the year and the Board of Directors maintains oversight over the Company's human capital, including talent management and succession planning. The Compensation and Governance Committee has oversight over our compensation and benefits programs, as well as our Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG") program. Generally, we consider our commitment to ESG matters to include, among other things, respect for human rights, ethical and sustainable sourcing, environmental and climate change initiatives, evaluating the impact of our practices on the communities in which we operate and our associates, and charitable giving.

SEASONALITY

Our business is seasonal. We define our seasons as Spring, which includes the first and second quarters, and Fall, which includes the third and fourth quarters. Historically, we have realized a higher portion of our net sales and net income in the Fall season due primarily to the impact of the holiday season. Generally, approximately 45% of our annual net sales occur in the Spring season and 55% occur in the Fall season. Cash needs are typically higher in the third quarter due to inventory-related working capital requirements for early Fall and holiday selling periods. Our business is also subject, at certain times, to calendar shifts, which may occur during key selling periods close to holidays such as Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.
