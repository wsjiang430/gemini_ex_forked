Item 1. Description of Business.
Organization and Corporate History
 
Forge Innovation Development Corp., or the “Company”, was initially incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 15, 2016 under the name of You-Go enterprises, LLC (the “Company Predecessor”). On November 3, 2016, the Company filed an amendment to its Articles of Incorporation in the State of Nevada to change the Company’s name to Forge Innovation Development Corp. Our principle executive office is located at 6280 Mission Blvd Unit 205,Jurupa Valley, CA 92509. Tel : 626-986-4566. The Company’s main business is focus on real estate development, land purchasing and selling and property management.
 
On August 17, 2020, the Company established a wholly-owned subsidiary, Forge Network Inc, in the State of California. As of December 31, 2022, we have not generated any income from the subsidiary yet due to our business strategy adjustment.
 
On March 24, 2023, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement between Forge Innovation Development Corp. (the “Company” or the “Buyer”) and Legend Investment Management, LLC (“Legend LLC” or the “Seller”), the Company acquired 77.3% of Legend LLC’s 66% ownership of Legend International Investment, LP (“Legend LP”). Legend LP owns 100% of Mission Marketplace; a grocery anchored shopping center (the “Property”) located at 6240 Mission Boulevard in Jurupa Valley, California. The Property contains two, one-story and one, two-story buildings containing 48,722 total square foot of gross leasable area situated on a 4.51acre site.
 
The Seller is an affiliate of the Company and therefore the acquisition is being treated as a related party transaction. The Company acquired 51% interest of Legend LP from Legend LLC in exchanged for 1,967,143 common stocks of the Company, valued at $0.70 per share for a total purchase price of $1,377,000, which equals 51% of Legend LP’s approximate net value of $2,700,000 based on (1) the Property’s valuation appraisal report dated on February 20, 2023, (2) Legend LP’s net book value as of February 28, 2023, and (3) the loan agreement to Legend LP by a third-party lender effective on March 23, 2023. After the closing of the acquisition, the Company will own 51% of Legend LP and the Seller will own 15% of Legend LP.
 
Overview
 
The Company’s primary objective is commercial and residential land development, including, to a lesser extent, the possible purchase and sale of real estate, targeting properties primarily in Southern California. We also intend to manage properties we own and properties owned by unaffiliated third parties. Our activities will include securing acquisition rights to properties, obtaining zoning and other entitlements for the properties, securing financing for purchase of the properties, improving the properties’ infrastructure and amenities and selling the properties to homeowner and commercial owners for restaurants, offices and small businesses. Our first property acquisition was 29 acres in the city of Desert Hot Springs in Southern California. Due to problems with permits and adjacent landowners, rather than get involved in protracted negotiations, the Company sold the property to an independent third party for a profit.
 
On August 1, 2017, the Company entered into a property management agreement with Bloomage Beverly Hills Investment Inc. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company provided property management services for Bloomage Beverly Hills Investment Inc. in exchange for the compensation of $3,000 per month. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the service charges increased to $5,000 per month. In April 2022, we terminated the property management services with Bloomage Beverly Hills Investment Inc. due to the sales of the managed properties. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized management service income of $15,000 and $36,000, respectively, under this agreement.
 
On April 2, 2022, the Company entered into a property management agreement with Legend International Investment, LP. (the “Legend LP”), a related party of the Company, of which the management is related to Mr. Patrick Liang, President and CEO of the Company. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company will manage the properties owned by Legend LP, which is called Mission Marketplace; a grocery anchored shopping center (the “Property”) located at 6240 Mission Boulevard in Jurupa Valley, California. The Property contains two, one-story and one, two-story buildings containing 48,722 total square foot of gross leasable area situated on a 4.51-acre site. The original monthly service charge was $5,000 which was amended to $10,000 per month in June 2022 due to Legend LP required additional management services for their properties. On November 17, 2022, the monthly service charge was amended to $15,000 with one year term due to new tenants moving in and additional management services desired. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized property management income from Legend LP in the amount of $107,000.

Business Strategy
 
The Company’s business strategy includes the following three main segments of the real estate business:
 

1. | We intend to acquire and develop land for residential and commercial development. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | We also, to a lesser extent, intend to develop a diversified real estate portfolio by investing in residential real estate, including single-family housing, condos and town-homes and commercial properties, including strip-malls and small office buildings. 
3. | We intend to provide property management for our own properties and for properties owned by non-affiliated third parties. 

Property Development
 
The Company primary business is to acquire land and develop and sell fully constructed homes and commercial property such as stores, offices, private schools, etc., to non-affiliated third parties. Our first property acquisition was 29 acres of vacant land in the city of Desert Hot Springs in Southern California. Our original plan was to build various commercial buildings on the parcels, including stores and restaurants. However, due to problems with permits and adjacent landowners that would lead to lengthy negotiations and possibly additional costs, the Company sold the property in March 2017, to a non-affiliated third party for a profit.
 
Our principal activities are securing acquisition rights to properties, obtaining zoning and other entitlements for the properties, securing financing for the purchase of the properties, improving the properties’ infrastructure and amenities, and selling properties to third parties. Currently all of our property development activities are centered in the Southern California area.
 
Investing in Development Projects
 
The Company intends to invest a small portion of its funds and to utilize funds pooled from investors to directly invest in income-yielding properties. The Company will concentrate on investing in properties with long-term leases.
 
We rely on our management’s expertise in identifying residential and commercial real estate assets within our stated target objectives. Our Management makes investment decisions based on various factors, including, relative value, expected risk-adjusted returns, current and projected credit fundamentals, current and projected macroeconomic considerations, current and projected supply and demand, credit and market risk concentration limits, liquidity, cost of financing and financing availability, as well as maintaining our exemption from registration under the 1940 Act.
 
Our targeted asset classes and the principal investments we have made and expect to make in each are as follows:
 

Asset Class | Principal Investments 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------
Residential Property | ● | Single family attached, Single Family detached, multi-unit, condominiums, townhomes, etc. 
Partially completed real estate developments, residential, commercial, retail. | ● | Acquisition and sale of vacant land 
REO Tape Transactions | ● | Bulk or block acquisitions of single family detached residential units or homes. 

 
Our primary business strategy is to seek out and secure real estate properties that may have been formerly subjected to distressed financing terms as a consequence of recent economic factors. Our focus is on residential, single-family detached homes throughout Southern California made available individually or bulk transfer from various private parties or financial institutions seeking to liquidate non-performing assets.

Another business strategy is designed to generate a rate of return by acquiring distressed properties (individually or in bulk transaction(s)) for investment purposes and eventual resale. We believe there is a significant market opportunity to acquire discounted real estate assets or in some instances, to lend to or invest with real estate developers and property owners or otherwise participate in real estate related investments where non-traditional financing sources are not available. The current credit crisis and economic environment and the strict underwriting standards and length of time required by traditional sources including banking institutions are often prohibitive.
 
Property Management
 
In many cases we will manage our own properties and market our property management service to others. Property management involves most of the following duties
 

● | Establishes rental rate by surveying local rental rates; calculating overhead costs, depreciation, taxes, and profit goals. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Attracts tenants by advertising vacancies; obtaining referrals from current tenants; explaining advantages of location and services; showing units. 
● | Contracts with tenants by negotiating leases; collecting security deposit. 
● | Accomplishes financial objectives by collecting rents; paying bills; forecasting requirements; preparing an annual budget; scheduling expenditures; analyzing variances; initiating corrective action. 
● | Maintains property by investigating and resolving tenant complaints; enforcing rules of occupancy; inspecting vacant units and completing repairs; planning renovations; contracting with landscaping and snow removal services. 
● | Maintains building systems by contracting for maintenance services; supervising repairs. 
● | Secures property by contracting with security patrol service; installing and maintaining security devices; establishing and enforcing precautionary policies and procedures; responding to emergencies. 
● | Enforces occupancy policies and procedures by confronting violators. 
● | Prepares reports by collecting, analyzing, and summarizing data and trends. 

 
We also intend to provide the following special services to our third part owners:
 

● | Legal Services 
--+-------------------


– | Eviction Coordination 
--+---------------------------------
– | Personal Property Management 
– | Property Inspections 


● | Closing — Title Services 
--+-----------------------------


– | Title Closing Documents and Preparation

– | Escrow and Closing Coordination 
– | HUD Reviews and Analysis 


● | Reports

● | Accounting — Financial 
--+---------------------------


– | Expenses Report and Management 
--+--------------------------------------
– | Expense Tracking 
– | Review and Process Reimbursements 

Sales and Marketing
 
We intend to market our properties through real estate brokers and agents coordinated by company marketing personnel. Our marketing efforts will target both international and local buyers and builders. We also look for suitable real estate projects for management and operation.
Competition
 
We believe there are only limited barriers to entry in our business. Current and future competitors may have more resources than we have. Our projects face competition generally from REITs, institutional pension plans and other public and private real estate companies and private real estate investors for the acquisition of properties and for raising capital. In transaction services, we face competition with other real estate firms in the acquisition and disposition of properties, and we also compete with other sponsors of real estate for investors to provide the capital to allow us to make these investments. We also compete against other real estate companies who may be chosen by a broker-dealer as an investment platform instead of us. In management services, we compete with other properties for viable investors for properties. We also believe that our broker dealers compete, or will compete, with institutions that provide or arrange for other types of financing through private or public offerings of equity or debt and from traditional bank financings.
 
Real estate development is a highly competitive business. We compete with numerous developers, builders and others for the acquisition of property. As we attempt to expand our operations we will certainly be competing with other business ranging from large multinational corporations to small startup business such as ourselves. Many of our competitors may have longer operating histories, better brand recognition and greater financial resources than we do. To successfully compete in our industry, we will need to:
 

● | Ensure that investments in our projects are affordable; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | That we only invest in properties in well-priced locations; 
● | That our investment strategy is simple to understand; and 
● | That we provide outstanding customer service and rigid integrity in our business dealings. 

 
However, there can be no assurance that even if we do these things we will be able to compete effectively with the other companies in our industry. We believe we have the required management expertise in sourcing properties with good development potential and affordable price.
 
We are committed to work and communicate with our investors and sales consultants to identify their goals and needs which will make it easier to continually provide them with the best products and services.
 
Government Regulations
 
Real Property Development
 
Land development permits and approvals are required to develop real property. These permits and approvals will vary depending on the land that is being developed.
 
The commercial and residential real estate development industry is subject to substantial environmental, building, construction, zoning and real estate regulations that are imposed by various federal, state and local authorities. In developing a community, we must obtain the approval of numerous government agencies regarding such matters as permitted land uses, housing density, the installation of utility services (such as water, sewer, gas, electric, telephone and cable television) and the dedication of acreage for open space, parks, schools and other community purposes. Regulations affect commercial building and homebuilding by specifying, among other things, the type and quality of building materials that must be used, certain aspects of land use and building design and the manner in which homebuilders may conduct their sales, operations, and overall relationships with potential renters and buyers. Furthermore, changes in prevailing local circumstances or applicable laws may require additional approvals, or modifications of approvals previously obtained. These permits and approvals will vary depending on the land that is being developed.

Timing of the initiation and completion of development projects depends upon receipt of necessary authorizations and approvals. Because of the provisional nature of these approvals and the concerns of various environmental and public interest groups, the approval process can be delayed by withdrawals or modifications of preliminary approvals and by litigation and appeals challenging development rights. Our ability to develop projects could be delayed or prevented due to litigation challenging previously obtained governmental approvals. We also may be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing in certain communities due to building moratoriums or “slow-growth” or “no-growth” initiatives that could be implemented in the future. Such delays could adversely affect our ability to complete our projects, significantly increase the costs of doing so or drive potential customers to purchase competitors’ products.
 
Management Services
 
We and our brokers, salespersons and, in some instances, property managers are regulated by the states in which we do business. These regulations may include licensing procedures, prescribed professional responsibilities and anti-fraud provisions. Our activities are also subject to various local, state, national and international jurisdictions’ fair advertising, trade, housing and real estate settlement laws and regulations and are affected by laws and regulations relating to real estate and real estate finance and development.
Environmental Compliance
 
Federal, state and local laws and regulations impose environmental zoning restrictions, use controls, disclosure obligations and other restrictions that impact the management, development, use or sale of real estate. Such laws and regulations tend to discourage sales and leasing activities with respect to some properties. If transactions in which we are involved are delayed or abandoned as a result of these restrictions, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, a failure by us to disclose environmental concerns to potential investors or third-party buyers of the developed property may subject our company to liability and may adversely impact our business or cause us to incur costs for cleanup of hazardous substances or wastes or other environmental liabilities.
 
Various environmental laws and regulations also can impose liability for the costs of investigating or remediating hazardous or toxic substances at sites currently or formerly owned or operated by a party, or at off-site locations to which such party sent wastes for disposal. As a property manager, we could be held liable as an operator for any such contamination; even if the original activity was legal and we had no knowledge of, or did not cause, the release or contamination. Further, because liability under some of these laws is joint and several, we could be held responsible for more than our share, or even all, of the costs for such contaminated site if the other responsible parties are unable to pay. Similarly, we are generally obliged, under the debt financing arrangements on the properties owned by us, to provide an indemnity to the lenders for environmental liabilities and to remediate any environmental problems that might arise. Insurance for these matters may not always be available, or sufficient to cover our losses.
 
Employees
 
Currently the Company has 2 employees including Mr. Liang, the President/CEO of the Company, who devotes approximately 100% of his time to the business of the Company.
