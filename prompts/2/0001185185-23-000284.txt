Our consumer-focused multi-lingual, customer care specialists are available by live chat and telephone Monday through Thursday, from 9 a.m. to 7:00 pm (ET), and on Friday from 9:00 am to 5 pm (ET).

--+-----------------------------------------------------------

● | Origin, seasonality, and availability

Our logistics team manages the shipping and delivery process of every package to ensure timely delivery of products to our customers. We have developed the web-based capability to allow customers to seamlessly receive and send personal orders and gifts according to their desired schedule. The logistics manager receives shipping information on all products ordered, and packages are monitored from origin to delivery. In the event that delivery service is interrupted, our logistics department begins the process of expediting the package to its destination or potentially reshipping the package with a goal of 100% customer satisfaction for our customers. Our logistics manager works directly with our suppliers on an ongoing basis, to ensure that the appropriate packaging and shipping specifications are in place at all times. At the beginning of March 2020, as early signs were beginning to emerge that Covid-19 might potentially be a significant issue in the United states, we initiated additional preventative safety measures in our facilities and we continued adding additional preventative safety measures including protective gear for employees, temperature testing, ongoing onsite team of cleaning and sanitizing specialists, social distancing, special no contact package handling protocols. While we continue to assess and modify as appropriate, measures targeted towards the safety of our employees and the safety of our facilities and our products, as of December 31, 2022, we have returned to our pre-COVID-19 protocols.



Relationship with U.S. Foods



We have historically sold the majority of our products, $39,531,207 and $28,415,263, respectively, representing 49% and 46% of total sales, respectively, in each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, through a distributor relationship between FII, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and subsidiaries of U.S. Foods, a leading broadline distributor. On January 26, 2015 we executed a contract directly between FII and U.S. Foods (the “U.S. Foods Agreement”). The term of the U.S. Foods Agreement was from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2016 and provided for a limited number of automatic annual renewals thereafter if no party gives the other 30 days’ notice of its intent not to renew. Based on the terms, the U.S. Foods Agreement was extended through December 31, 2018. Effective January 1, 2018 the U.S. Foods Agreement was further amended to remove the cap on renewals, and provide for an unlimited number of additional 12-month terms unless either party notifies the other in writing, 30 days prior to the end date, of its intent not to renew.

Growth Strategy



To drive growth within the specialty food space, we intend to focus our efforts in demand driven active sales channels and leverage our ability to offer our products across multiple selling channels including to professional chefs within the restaurant channel as well as directly to consumers at home via ecommerce. We expect to continue offering unique and premium quality products as well as new product introduction and innovation to our customers and potential customers. In addition, we plan on continuing to value and strive for a high level of personalized customer service.



We anticipate attempting to grow our business through:




- | Introduction of new products, suppliers, and food trends to customers across all of our sales channels.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Increased ecommerce conversion rates by improving the shopping experience on our website.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Growth in the number of unique visitors to our various ecommerce sites.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Maximize sales of current product catalog to our existing customers and potential new customers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Expansion of availability of branded products and new brands which are consistent with the changing demands of customers in the U.S.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Leveraging igourmet.com and mouth.com toward further expansion of our sales and distribution channels either organically or through acquisition.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Leveraging our platforms to partner, build and/or acquire both foodservice brands and other consumer oriented entities and consumer brands such as D2C digitally native brands including stand alone brands and online retailer brands.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




In addition to attempting to grow our current business, we believe that there are lateral opportunities in the food industry and related markets. We may consider the possibility of acquiring specialty food manufacturers, specialty food distributors, small specialty food brands especially digitally native D2C brands, or e-commerce retailers and other business. We anticipate that, given our current cash flow levels, any acquisition could potentially involve the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or third party financing, which may not be available on acceptable terms. No acquisition will be consummated without thorough due diligence. No assurance can be given that we will be able to identify and successfully conclude negotiations with any potential target.



The Company’s new management is reviewing the Company’s operations with a view to increasing sales levels, profit margins, and overall profitability.



Competition



While we face intense competition in the marketing of our products and services, it is our belief that there are few companies offering a platform similar to ours, which include expansive backend and front end capabilities in both ecommerce and foodservice in addition there are few companies offering a broad range of customer service oriented, quality, chef driven products and specialty gourmet products, for nationwide delivery from same day, depending on market location to 72 hours. Our primary competition is from local purveyors that supply a limited local market and have a limited range of products and from the other specialty gourmet distributors and specialty food retail stores or ecommerce stores, and from the national, regional or local expansion of specialty and non-specialty food distributers and food stores and food focused ecommerce sites. In addition, many purveyors are well established, have reputations for success in the development and marketing of these types of products and services and have significantly greater financial, marketing, distribution, personnel and other resources. These financial and other capabilities permit such companies to implement extensive advertising and promotional campaigns, both generally and in response to efforts by additional competitors such as us, to enter into new markets and introduce new products and services.
Insurance



We maintain a Business Owners Policy with a general liability per occurrence limit of $1,000,000 and aggregate policy covering $2,000,000 of liability for all entities. The Company carries an Auto Policy with non-owned automobile bodily injury and property damage coverage with a limit of $1,000,000 for all entities. The Company also carries an Umbrella policy of up to $14,000,000 which covers all entities, along with two excess umbrella policies that sit over the BOP and Umbrella policies. The excess umbrella policies have limits of $5,000,000 and $6,000,000. The Company carries a Cyber policy of up to $2,000,000 which insures the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company carries two Commercial Property Policies, for its buildings in PA and FL, with a limit of up to $12,490,000 for PA and a limit of up to $1,630,000 for FL. Such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all potential claims against us and additional insurance may not be available in the future at a reasonable price.

Government Regulation



Various federal and state laws currently exist, and more are sure to be adopted, regulating the delivery of fresh food products. We require specialty foodservice third-party vendors to certify that they maintain at least $3,000,000 liability insurance coverage in aggregate and compliance with Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP), an FDA- and USDA-mandated food safety program, or a similar standard. Any changes in the government regulation of delivering of fresh food products that hinders our current ability and/or cost to deliver fresh products, could adversely impact our net revenues and gross margins and, therefore, our profitability and cash flows could also be adversely affected.
Employees



We currently employ 128 full-time employees, including 7 chefs and 2 executive officers. We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory. None of our employees are represented by a union.
Transactions with Major Customers



Transactions with a major customer and related economic dependence information is set forth (1) following our discussion of Liquidity and Capital Resources, (2) Under the heading Major Customer in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, (3) in Business – Relationship with U.S. Foods, (4) as the third item under Risk Factors.
