ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
Our Mission
Our mission is to champion the world's creators by helping them monetize their content, creativity, and influence.
Corporate Information
IZEA Worldwide, Inc. (together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, “we,” “us,” “our,” “IZEA,” or the “Company”) is a Nevada corporation that was founded in February 2006 under the name PayPerPost, Inc. and became a public company in May 2011. In January 2015, IZEA purchased all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Ebyline, Inc. (“Ebyline”). In March 2016, we formed IZEA Canada, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary incorporated in Ontario, Canada, to provide sales and support for IZEA's Canadian customers. In July 2016, IZEA purchased all the outstanding shares of capital stock of ZenContent, Inc. (“ZenContent”) and, in July 2018, a subsidiary of the Company merged with TapInfluence, Inc. (“TapInfluence”). ZenContent, Ebyline, and TapInfluence were merged into IZEA in December 2017, December 2019, and December 2020, respectively. 
Our Company is based in Orlando, Florida, but operates as a virtual-first company, with all of our employees working remotely since March 16, 2020.
Industry Background and Trends
When IZEA first launched PayPerPost in 2006, the concept of a brand paying bloggers to create sponsored content on their blogs was new and highly controversial among marketers and content creators. The idea was introduced by the Company when there were no ads on Facebook, YouTube, or Twitter, and social media was largely void of corporate marketing messages. Since then, the landscape has dramatically changed. Today, strategic engagement of online influencers is table stakes for modern brands - largely due to changes in consumer behavior and the large-scale adoption of social media platforms. Similarly, those same companies are now producing custom marketing content for their social channels and embracing influencer marketing as a means to reach their customers. 
While industry research indicates that brand spending on influencer and content marketing has grown dramatically in the last several years, the business processes and practices have yet to evolve in a meaningful way for most buyers and sellers. The markets that we operate in are highly fragmented, highly competitive, and primarily limited by the current inefficiencies inherent in our space. Most marketers have been forced to utilize a variety of execution partners and manual processes to navigate the complicated landscape, often resulting in low returns on their time investment or, worse-yet, questionable results. We believe this is mainly due to marketers and creators lacking an efficient way to identify and engage each other in a marketplace of scale. 
At the same time, influencers and content creators seeking to monetize their communities and work product face significant challenges in making marketers aware of their services and finding quality brands motivated to sponsor them. In addition, those creators with smaller followings need more individual influence and audience to warrant the processing of a micro-transaction. In many cases, it costs a marketer more money to issue a traditional check to a nano influencer than the value of the sponsorship payment itself. Further complicating the sponsorship process for both parties are federal regulations around social media endorsements, tax reporting generally applicable to anyone receiving income for services, and the associated campaign tracking required to provide compliance. While many marketers would prefer to be “part of the conversation,” we believe the complexity and cost of individual sponsorship often deter them from doing so.
We believe that addressing the current efficiency and measurable success challenges via technology represents a significant opportunity. IZEA ultimately addresses these challenges with targeted, scalable software solutions that aggregate content creators, while providing marketers with a variety of tools that dataset to help them make informed decisions. In doing so, we offer multiple efficient, innovative ways for creators and marketers of all sizes to find each other and form a compensated relationship.
By continually developing our creator network both directly and through talent partners, we make our company more attractive to our customers who seek a wide variety of creators to fulfill their content and advertising needs. As marketers utilize our software and services to a greater extent, we expect to increase the monetization opportunities for creators, which should, in turn, attract even more creators and further enhance value for our marketers. 
Business
IZEA is a marketing technology company providing software and professional services that enable brands to collaborate and transact with the full spectrum of today’s top social influencers and content creators. The Company is a champion for the growing creator economy, enabling individuals to monetize their content, creativity, and influence. 
While most large brand marketers engage us to perform these services on their behalf, they may also use our software to engage creators for influencer marketing campaigns or to produce custom content on a self-service basis by licensing our technology. We create and operate online software services that connect marketers, including brands, agencies, and publishers, with content creators such as Instagram influencers, TikTok influencers, YouTube stars, designers, photographers, and writers (“creators”) and provide marketers access to our industry expertise, data, and analytics. 
Since 2014, our primary technology platform, the IZEA Exchange (“IZEAx”), has provided a unified ecosystem enabling the creation and publication of multiple types of content to be completed at scale. During 2022, we re-imagined our influencer marketing platform based on user feedback, announcing the initial rollout of IZEA Flex (“Flex”) in September, and we announced the commercial launch of Flex in January 2023. Flex, which introduces end-to-end tracking of social commerce, enables brands to measure influencer impact on direct revenue at scale. The platform includes eight modules, each of which provide their own benefit to marketers as stand-alone tools, but enhance each other when used together. Flex is aggressively priced relative to our competitors in the market, and our strategy is to lead with price to value.
Influencer Marketing. We work with marketers to enable influencer marketing campaigns at scale. A subset of influencer marketing known as “Sponsored Social” is when a company compensates creators for sharing sponsored content with the creators’ social network followers. This sponsored content is within the body of the content stream. We believe that we pioneered the concept of a marketplace for sponsorships on the social web in 2006 with the launch of our first platform, PayPerPost, and have focused on scaling our product and service offerings ever since.
Custom Content. We also work with marketers to augment or replace their content development efforts. Our network of creators produces editorial and marketing content that can be published online and offline. Our network of creators includes professional journalists, subject matter experts, bloggers, and everyday content creators, allowing our customers to produce content ranging from complex white papers to simple product descriptions. Many of our content customers use this service to create a steady stream of posts for their corporate blogs. 
Software + Service. IZEA’s flexible client engagement model appeals to agency and brand customers with various needs. We structure content and influencer marketing programs that align with our customer’s goals, resources, and profiles. IZEA clients can hire our team for fully outsourced managed services, access our software to run their program, or engage us in a hybrid model that combines access to our software with collaborative execution.
Our Platforms
Flex.  Building upon more than a decade and a half of experience in the influencer marketing industry, we announced the commercial launch of our next-generation influencer marketing platform in January 2023. Flex, which will supplant IZEAx in 2023, is a platform with flexibility as a core tenet, allowing marketers to use any combination of independent applications as they see fit. The result is a comprehensive suite of tools that, individually, supercharge influencer marketing efforts and become even more powerful when combined. Flex offers eight core modules: Discover, ContentMine, ShareMonitor, Integrations, Tracking Links, Contacts, Transactions, and Campaigns.
Flex introduces end-to-end tracking of social commerce, allowing marketers to easily measure the impact of individual influencers on e-commerce revenue at scale, and integrates key functions of The Creator Marketplace on IZEA.com. Modules in Flex include:
• Discover, which allows marketers to search through content from millions of influencer social profiles while filtering across channels, demographics, and interests; 
•ContentMine, a content management tool that collects and measures influencer content, providing real-time insights and A.I. content analysis from BrandGraph; 
•ShareMonitor, a multi-platform social monitoring tool that allows marketers to monitor hashtags, keywords, and brand mentions across leading social platforms; 
•Integrations provides deep integrations such as with Google Analytics and Shopify, providing marketers the capability to track influencer campaign metrics such as time on site, engagement, and revenue; 
•Tracking Links provides real-time tracking metrics for influencer marketing and can track customer conversions, spend, and purchases when used with other Flex modules;
•Contacts provides the ability to create custom contact lists that span the creator ecosystem, including influencers, agents, and legal representation; smart lists use demographic information to automatically group creator contacts;
•Transactions makes sending creator payments faster and at a lower cost, providing searchable transaction data; and
•Campaigns provides the foundation to build campaigns, organize and find creators, content, and insights to inform influencer marketing strategies.
Marketplace. In October 2022, we launched The Creator Marketplace (Marketplace) on IZEA.com, which provides powerful tools for creators to showcase their social handles, as well as the brands and topics they post about, and enables marketers to easily search and filter creator listings that meet the requirements of their influencer marketing campaigns, including creator specific predictive audience demographics. Marketplace features include Casting Calls which enable marketers and creators to connect and collaborate; marketers use Casting Calls to solicit creators for everything from influencing campaigns to full-time employment; creators respond directly to Casting Calls with video and text responses.
IZEAx. The platform is designed to provide a unified ecosystem that enables the creation and publication of multiple types of custom content through our creators’ websites, blogs, and social media channels, including, among others, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Twitch, and Instagram. We use IZEAx to manage influencer marketing campaigns on behalf of our marketers; our marketers also use the platform as a self-service tool and as a licensed white-label product. IZEAx will be sunset during 2023, replaced and supplemented by Flex. In January of 2023 we stopped accepting new contracts for IZEAx. Current customers can transition their license to Flex, or will be able to receive a refund for the remainder of their license when IZEAx is officially shut down.
BrandGraph. BrandGraph is a social media intelligence platform that offers marketers an analysis of share-of-voice, engagement benchmarking, category spending estimates, influencer identification, and sentiment analysis. The platform maps the complex hierarchy of corporation-to-brand relationships by category, associates social content with brands aggregates, and analyzes content data to provide insights for marketers across their competitive landscapes. BrandGraph is heavily integrated with IZEAx, and both platforms rely heavily on data from each other, but it is also available as a stand-alone platform. We plan to sunset BrandGraph as a standalone application later in 2023 as its toolset is incorporated into both Flex and Marketplace. Marketers will be able to access many of BrandGraph’s features through Flex and Marketplace.
Legacy Platform
Shake. In November 2020, we launched Shake, an online marketplace where buyers could quickly and easily hire creators of all types for influencer marketing, photography, design, and other digital services. The Shake platform, aimed at digital creators seeking freelance “gig” work, enabled creators to list available “Shakes” and marketers to select and purchase creative packages through a streamlined chat experience, assisted by ShakeBot - a proprietary artificial intelligence assistant. Shake was sunset in October 2022 in conjunction with the launch of Marketplace, which replaces and improves upon Shake’s functionality.
Sales and Marketing
We primarily sell influencer marketing and custom content campaigns through our client development team and platforms. We target regional, national, and global brands and advertising agencies in the following ways:
Client Development Team.  Our client development team is assigned a geographic region or specific markets, primarily within the U.S., Canada, and China. Team members are responsible for identifying and managing sales opportunities to brands and agencies seeking to outsource some or all of the planning and production of their content and advertising needs. 
SaaS Sales Team. The SaaS Sale team initiates SaaS license opportunities with brands and agencies who seek to utilize additional functionality on our platforms on a self-service basis to facilitate custom content and influencer campaigns. This team was eliminated in 2022 with the addition of Flex and Marketplace. 
Self-Service.  Flex, Marketplace, and IZEAx offerings are tailored to smaller marketing customers that want to use our software to identify, engage, measure, and pay influencers on their own. Our software offerings are designed to be self-service, with no outbound sales team. Marketing customers can sign up with a credit card and begin using the platform.
Industry Acumen. Our team possesses strong marketing and advertising background. We focus our corporate marketing efforts on increasing brand awareness, communicating each of our platform advantages, generating qualified leads for our sales team, growing our creator network, and driving self-service sign-ups to our platforms. Our corporate marketing plan is designed to continually elevate awareness of our brand and generate demand for our software and services. We rely on a growing number of channels in this area, including third-party social media platforms (e.g., Meta and YouTube), paid search engine marketing, content marketing, influencer marketing, and virtual events.
Customers and Revenue
Historically, we have generated revenue from four primary sources: (1) revenue from our managed services when a marketer (typically a brand, agency, or partner) pays us to provide custom content, influencer marketing, amplification, or other campaign management services (“Managed Services”); (2) revenue from fees charged to software customers on their marketplace spend within our platforms (“Marketplace Spend Fees”); (3) revenue from license and subscription fees charged to access the IZEAx and BrandGraph platforms (“License Fees”); and (4) revenue derived from other fees such as inactivity fees, early cash-out fees, and other miscellaneous fees charged to users of our platforms (“Other Fees”). 
Beginning in 2023, as we phase out IZEAx, our emphasis is to drive marketer and creator adoption and grow license fee revenues, in part by replacing fees associated with marketplace spend with basic transaction fees designed to cover costs. We believe that by providing a stronger toolset and lower transaction costs, we will attract more licensees. License Fee revenues will be primarily driven by Flex and Marketplace. BrandGraph and IZEAx tools are being repurposed into Flex and Marketplace during 2023.
As discussed in more detail within “Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates” under “Note 1. Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” under Part I, Item 7 herein, revenue from Marketplace Spend Fees is reported on a net basis. Revenue from all other sources, including Managed Services, License Fees, and Other Fees, are reported on a gross basis. We further categorize these sources into two primary groups: (1) Managed Services and (2) SaaS Services, which includes revenue from Marketplace Spend Fees, License Fees, and Other Fees.
We provide services to customers in multiple industry segments, including consumer products, retail/e-tail, lifestyle, technology, and travel. Our business serves advertising and public relations agencies, brands, and companies directly. In many cases, influencer marketing dollars flow through the advertising or public relations agency, even when we have a direct relationship with the brand. 
We generate the majority of our revenue from our Managed Services customers. Managed Services accounted for approximately 96% and 94% of our revenue during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. SaaS Services accounted for approximately 4% and 6% of our revenue during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. 
Changes in how we control and manage our platforms, contractual terms, business practices, or other changes in accounting standards or interpretations may change our revenue reporting. See “Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” under Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information as it relates to our revenue recognition policies.
The majority of our customers are located in the United States (“U.S.”). We had one customer that accounted for 29% of our revenue during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, and one customer that accounted for 14% of our revenue during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021.
Technology 
Our technology platforms span multiple social networks and digital creative services. We aggregate creators in our platforms, which allows us to create scale and choice for marketers. We provide the ability to find and collaborate with our creators based on a variety of software rules, filters, and data enrichment. Our self-service platforms service all business types and sizes, ranging from Fortune 500 customers to small agencies and brands. We provide trackable results for influencer marketing campaigns through tracking links and support for third-party tracking platforms. IZEA technology includes content monitoring, dashboards for real-time reporting, and digital asset management. 
Privacy and Security
We are committed to protecting the personal privacy of our marketers and creators. Any personal information that we collect is processed in compliance with privacy laws (discussed below, under “Government Regulation”), and we believe that we employ reasonable and appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect personal information. 
Product Development
Our product development team is responsible for platform and infrastructure development, application development, user interface, application design, enterprise connectivity, Internet applications and design, quality assurance, documentation, and release management. Among our core strengths is our knowledge of and experience in launching and operating scalable content and influencer marketing marketplaces. Our product development expenses include salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, employee benefit costs, and miscellaneous departmental costs related to our development team, along with hosting and software subscription costs, and are included in general and administrative expenses.
We announced that our primary product platform, IZEAx, which was originally launched in March 2014, is being replaced by Flex in early 2023. We launched Marketplace in November 2022, replacing Shake and adding additional functionality. We will continue to add new features and additional functionality to the Flex and Marketplace platforms in 2023.
Competition 
We face competition from multiple companies in the influencer and content marketing categories. Direct and indirect competitors in the influencer marketing space include Meta, TikTok, YouTube, Linqia, and Upfluence. We also face competition in the creator economy from companies such as Fiverr and Upwork. In addition, there are many traditional advertising agencies, public relations firms, and niche consultancies that provide content development and conduct manual influencer outreach programs.
Competition could result in significant price pressure, declining margins, and reductions in our revenue. As more companies have entered the influencer marketing space, it has driven down the price points for influencer marketing software. We have seen this impact our licensing fees over the past several years, and it has caused us to change our pricing strategy for software services. In addition, as we continue our efforts to expand the scope of our services with Flex and Marketplace we may compete with a greater number of other companies across an increasing range of different services, including in vertical markets where competitors may have advantages in expertise, brand recognition, and other areas. If existing or future competitors develop or offer products or services that provide significant performance, price, creative or other advantages over those offered by us, our business, prospects, results of operations, and financial condition could be negatively affected. 
We also compete with traditional advertising media such as direct mail, television, radio, cable, and print for a share of marketers' total advertising budgets. Many current and potential competitors enjoy competitive advantages over us, such as longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases, greater access to advertising space on high-traffic websites, and significantly greater financial, technical, sales, and marketing resources. 
Proprietary Rights
Proprietary rights are crucial to our success and competitive position. To evolve and secure our proprietary rights, we rely on intellectual property and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, and contractual provisions.
As of December 31, 2022, we owned 51 trademarks (35 domestic trademark registrations in the U.S. and 16 foreign registrations on the International Register) and had 2 total pending applications in the U.S., Canada, and Nigeria. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we abandoned 6 inactive U.S. trademarks. As of December 31, 2022, we also owned approximately 346 domain names related to the various aspects of IZEA’s products and services.
Government Regulation 
We are subject to many foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted by regulators or in the courts in ways that could adversely affect our business model. In the U.S. and abroad, laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties are currently being tested by several claims. These regulations and laws may involve taxation, tariffs, privacy and data protection, consumer protection, content, copyrights, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, and online payment services. In addition, governments may seek to censor content available on our platforms or attempt to block access to our platforms. Accordingly, adverse legal or regulatory developments could substantially harm our business.
We are subject to various federal, state, and international laws and regulations governing privacy, information security, and data protection laws (“Privacy Laws”). Legislators and/or regulators in countries in which we operate are increasingly adopting or revising Privacy Laws. All U.S. states have passed data breach notification laws, and others have adopted or expanded laws and regulations that address the security of personal information and the collection and use of personal information through websites. In particular, California passed a broad-reaching consumer privacy law in June 2018, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, called the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). In response to the CCPA, IZEA posted an updated California Privacy Notice on its websites. Virginia’s Consumer Data Protection Act (“CDPA”) came into effect on January 1, 2023, which is also when the California Privacy Rights and Enforcement Act of 2020 (“CPRA”) took effect. The U.S. Congress also is considering the implementation of a national Privacy Law. Outside the U.S., the European Union’s (“EU”) General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective May 25, 2018, has an extra-territorial scope and substantial fines (up to 4% of global annual revenue or €20M, whichever is greater). In 2018, Brazil passed a law similar to GDPR and other countries are considering similar laws. Enforcement of Privacy Laws also has increased over the past few years. Accordingly, new and revised Privacy Laws, together with stepped-up enforcement of existing Privacy Laws, could significantly affect our current and planned privacy, data protection, information security-related practices, our collection, use, sharing, retention, and safeguarding of consumer and/or employee information, and some of our current or planned business activities. 
The U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act has provisions that limit but do not eliminate our liability for linking to third-party websites. These websites may contain materials that infringe copyrights or other intellectual property rights of third parties. We must comply with the statutory requirements of this act. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.
As an e-commerce service provider, we are subject to Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914 (the “FTC Act”), which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices, including advertising and marketing on the Internet. Many states have consumer protection laws similar to the FTC Act with the purpose of prohibiting unfair and deceptive business practices. In some instances, we are retained by marketers to manage their advertising campaigns through our platforms, thereby increasing our exposure as not only the service provider but also the medium through which advertisements are broadcast. In addition to those requirements, the marketers, creators, and agencies that use our platforms are subject to specific guidelines and regulations regarding online advertising, such as the Dot Com Disclosures - Information about Online Advertising, issued by the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), the FTC’s Enforcement Policy Statement on Deceptively Formatted Advertisements, issued in 2015, and the FTC’s Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising (known as the Endorsement Guide) which were adopted in 2009, updated and reissued by the FTC in 2013, and further clarified in 2015 and are regularly enforced. The Endorsement Guide, for example, significantly extends the scope of potential liability associated with the use of testimonials and endorsements, including injecting endorsement requirements into advertising methods such as blogging, posting on Instagram, tweeting, and other online postings of sponsored advertisements by a creator. In particular, the Endorsement Guide provides that creators must always clearly and conspicuously disclose the material connection between the creator and the marketer, such as if they received consideration for blogging or posting about a particular product, service, brand, or the like, whether the consideration comprises something tangible (i.e. cash, discounts, objects that are provided to them at no cost, even for testing purposes) or intangible (such as accolades and more prominent future blogging or posting opportunities). In addition, the creator must not make claims about the product or service they are discussing that go beyond what the marketer could say about the product or service. The Endorsement Guide further provides that the marketer should ensure that creators speaking on its behalf are provided guidance and training needed to ensure their claims, statements, and representations are truthful, transparent, and properly substantiated, and monitor the activities of creators speaking on its behalf. If a creator, blogger, agency, or marketer should fail to comply with the Dot Com Disclosures, the Endorsement Guide, or any other FTC rule, regulation, or policy, which may be manifest by making deceptive, misleading, or unsubstantiated claims and representations, failing to disclose a sponsorship relationship or otherwise, then various parties related to the advertising campaign (including the service provider of the platform over which the campaign is managed) may be subject to liability as a result of such non-compliance. In the event it was found that we (or one of our marketer customers) failed to comply with the FTC Act or state consumer protection laws, it could result in the potential imposition of equitable redress or penalties that could include monetary damages, a modification of certain business practices, or an order to cease certain aspects of our operations. Other countries, such as Canada and EU member states, also have laws, regulations, and rules that mirror the FTC Endorsement Guide and similar consumer protection laws and guidance.
More generally, if there is negative consumer perception and mistrust of the practice of compensating creators to endorse the marketers' specific products, then marketers may become less interested in using influencer marketing platforms like ours as a means for advertising which could, in turn, materially adversely affect our business and financial results.
We are committed to promoting ethical social sponsorship practices and have established terms of service for users of our platforms, which refer to the Endorsement Guide and include one or more of the following:
Mandatory Disclosure. Our terms of service require the disclosure of the sponsored relationship between the marketer and creator. Failure to disclose the sponsored relationship violates our terms of service, which may result in the withholding of payment for the sponsorship and the creator being removed from our network.
Freedom of Choice. Creators are free to choose which brands to work with and what sponsored content they want to publish. Our platforms do not auto-inject a marketer's message into an influencer's social media network.
Authentic Voice. We encourage honesty of opinion in the selection of sponsorships by a creator and similarly we encourage marketers to create opportunities that allow the creator to write the sponsorship in their own words, provided that a creator always adheres to our terms of service and code of ethics which includes disclosing their sponsored relationships at all times while using any of the platforms.
Transparency of Identity. Our platforms are designed to be an open, safe environment for our marketers, creators, and users. We do not cloak the identities of marketers or creators. Both parties involved in a potential transaction can see each other's profiles and make informed decisions before engaging with each other.
Pre-Publication Marketer Review. Marketers may choose to request to review their sponsored content before it is published and to request a change to the sponsored content before publication in the case of factual inaccuracies.
Reporting Violations. We have zero tolerance for violations of our terms of service and encourage the reporting of violations directly to IZEA. If violations are reported, we promptly investigate them and in appropriate cases, marketers, creators, and users are removed from our network and prohibited from using our sites. 
We believe and have included requirements within our terms of service, based on positions taken by certain federal courts and the FTC, that communications and messages disseminated by our platform users are subject to and must comply at 
all times with CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 (Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act) requirements.
To date, we have not been materially impacted by the rules governing messaging over social media networks and social sponsorship, including the CAN-SPAM Act and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991. However, we cannot predict the impact of future regulations on us and marketers and creators who use our platforms, nor can we predict the effects of attempts to circumvent our mechanisms designed to ensure compliance.
Employees
As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of 126 employees, of which 123 were full-time employees, including 39 in sales and marketing, 42 in campaign fulfillment, 25 in technology and development, and 20 in administration and finance. None of our employees is represented by a collective bargaining agreement, nor have we experienced any work stoppage. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified engineers, sales and marketing, account management, and senior management personnel.
