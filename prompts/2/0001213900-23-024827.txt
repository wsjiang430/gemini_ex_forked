ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General



We are a blank check company formed as a Delaware corporation for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report as our initial business combination. While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business, industry, sector, or geography, we have initially focused our search on identifying a prospective target business in the healthcare or healthcare-related infrastructure industries in the United States and other developed countries.



In January 2021, our sponsor purchased 7,187,500 founder shares for a capital contribution of $25,000. In February 2021, our sponsor transferred 35,000 founder shares to each of our directors. Prior to the initial investment in the company of $25,000 by our sponsor, we had no assets, tangible or intangible. The per-share purchase price of the founder shares was determined by dividing the amount of cash contributed to us by the number of founder shares issued. Up to 937,500 founder shares were subject to forfeiture by our initial stockholders depending on the extent to which the underwriters’ over-allotment option was exercised so that the number of founder shares would remain equal to 20% of our common stock after our initial public offering. The over-allotment option was exercised in full on May 6, 2021; thus, these shares are no longer subject to forfeiture. As a result of redemptions following the Extension vote, described below, as of the date of this Annual Report, the founder shares held by our initial stockholders represent approximately 77.4% of our outstanding shares of common stock. See “Extension” below for more details.



The registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-253465) for our initial public offering was declared effective by SEC on March 16, 2021. On March 19, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering of 25,000,000 units, generating gross proceeds of $250,000,000. Each unit consists of one share of Class A common stock and one-third of one redeemable warrant, with each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. Simultaneously with the consummation of our initial public offering, we consummated the private placement of 4,500,000 private placement warrants to our sponsor at a price of $1.50 per private placement warrant, generating total gross proceeds of $6,750,000.



On May 6, 2021, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option in full, resulting in our issuance of an additional 3,750,000 units at a public offering price of $10.00 per unit. In addition, we consummated the sale of an additional 500,000 private placement warrants at $1.50 per private placement warrant, generating gross proceeds of $750,000. After giving effect to the exercise and close of the option, an aggregate of 28,750,000 units were issued in the initial public offering, with aggregate gross proceeds of $287,500,000.



A total of $287,500,000 (or $10.00 per unit sold in our initial public offering) of the net proceeds from our initial public offering and the private placement was placed in a trust account established for the benefit of our public shareholders (the “trust account”), with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and up until the Extension vote, as described below, was invested only in U.S. “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), having a maturity of 185 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations.



Upon implementation of the Extension, the $21.3 million of remaining trust funds were deposited in an interest-bearing demand deposit account at a bank until the earlier of: (i) the completion of our initial business combination within the required time period and (ii) the distribution of the trust account, as described below, except that interest earned on the trust account can be released to pay our taxes payable and for dissolution expenses up to $100,000, as applicable.



Our units began trading on March 18, 2021 on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “GAMCU.” Commencing on May 7, 2021, the shares of Class A common stock and warrants comprising the units began separate trading on Nasdaq under the symbols “GAMC” and “GAMCW,” respectively. Those units not separated continue to trade on Nasdaq under the symbol “GAMCU.”

Extension



On March 15, 2023, our stockholders approved an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (as amended, the “charter”) (the “Charter Amendment”). The Charter Amendment extended the date by which we have to consummate a business combination (the “Extension”) for an additional nine months, from March 19, 2023 (the “Termination Date”) to up to December 19, 2023 by electing to extend the date to consummate an initial business combination on a monthly basis for up to nine times by an additional one month each time after the Termination Date, until December 19, 2023 or a total of up to nine months after the Termination Date, or such earlier date as determined by our board of directors (the “Board”), unless the closing of our initial business combination shall have occurred, which we refer to as the “Extension,” and such later date, the “Extended Date”, provided that the Sponsor (or its affiliates or permitted designees) will deposit into the trust account an amount determined by multiplying $0.03 by the number of public shares then outstanding, up to a maximum of $105,000 for each such one-month extension unless the closing of the Company’s initial business combination shall have occurred, in exchange for a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note payable upon consummation of a business combination (each, an “Extension Payment.”)



In connection with the votes to approve the Extension, the holders of 26,649,519 shares of Class A common stock properly exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately $10.16 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $270,869,315, leaving approximately $21,349,573 in the trust account.



On March 16, 2023, our sponsor voluntarily converted the 7,047,500 shares of Class B common stock it held into 7,047,500 shares of Class A common stock in accordance with our charter (the “Conversion”).  Following the implementation of the Extension and the Conversion, we had 9,147,981 shares of Class A common stock outstanding and 140,000 shares of Class B common stock outstanding. As of the date of this Annual Report, the founder shares held by our initial stockholders represent approximately 77.4% of our outstanding shares of common stock.



Members of our team have deployed billions of dollars of equity capital buying and building industry-leading businesses and have developed a vast network of relationships with entrepreneurs, corporate executives, consultants, bankers, and other advisors who seek out the partnership of our management team when embarking on significant capital investment or potential change-of-control transactions. Our team has built proprietary networks and relationships that allow us to source transactions that are not broadly marketed. We use the same criteria that have guided our successful collective investment histories in underwriting, analyzing, and structuring a prospective transaction. We consider various types of companies that are appropriate for this particular corporate structure when assessing potential opportunities.



Our Management Team



We are led by an experienced team of managers, operators, and investors bound by shared insight. Combining our strong idiosyncratic views developed over decades of experience, we believe we are uniquely qualified to identify and successfully merge with a valuable target company.



For more information about our management team, See Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance of this Annual Report.



Competitive Advantage



The network, sourcing, valuation, diligence, and execution capabilities of our management team, sponsor and advisors should provide us what we believe to be a significant and attractive pipeline of opportunities from which to evaluate and select a target business that will benefit from our collective expertise. We capitalize on the following competitive advantages in our pursuit of target assets:

● | Extensive Private and Public Investing Experience. Our team is comprised of individuals who have extensive private equity, crossover, and public equities experience. We leverage the structuring and asset management expertise as well as the public markets insights of our team in identifying and executing potential business combinations. Mr. Babich has 20 years of investing and operating experience in the healthcare sector. In late 2020, Mr. Babich merged two Ambulatory Surgery Center software businesses, which created the leading modern software suite for the fast-growing ASC market. Mr. Doft, as CEO of Highline Capital, has been investing in healthcare companies in both public and private markets for more than 25 years, and has participated in several earlier stage private financings, including the creation of special purpose vehicles to facilitate profitable private investments in both Novocure and Passage Bio. Mr. Rechtschaffen, both personally and as CEO of AREX Capital and at his prior firms, has been investing in healthcare companies in both public and private markets for nearly two decades, including early-stage investments in Ambulnz, a leading provider of mobile medical services and transportation, and Veridikal, a leading provider of software-driven analytics and audit services to healthcare companies. Mr. Hirt has led over $3 billion of private equity investments throughout his career, including healthcare-industry investments in Epax Neutraceuticals and Trygg Pharma.

● | Execution and Structuring Capability for Complex Transactions. We believe we have the organizational resources, significant transaction experience, and reputation required to effectively and efficiently source opportunities, analyze companies, negotiate and optimize structures, and ultimately complete an acquisition of a target company. These types of transactions may be complex and require creative structuring, industry knowledge and expertise, rigorous due diligence, and extensive negotiation and documentation. We believe that our expertise and experience in executing transactions with varying degrees of complexity may enhance our ability to identify attractive acquisition opportunities. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Proprietary Sourcing and Deep Network of Industry Relationships Across Healthcare. We believe that our reputation, deep experience and proactive approach to sourcing transactions, and extensive industry relationships will continue to provide numerous investment opportunities. Mr. Babich’s operational and managerial expertise in the healthcare space make him a compelling partner for healthcare companies seeking capital solutions. In addition, members of our board have been longtime investors in both public and private healthcare firms. Moreover, given the combination of Mr. Babich’s and our board members’ long track records and reputations, as well as their broad and diverse networks, there will be significant potential for them to source new opportunities that may not be broadly marketed. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Creating Long-Term Shareholder Value. Marrying a well-positioned business with the capital it needs is but one way we intend to create value. Our collective track record helping companies grow, expand margins, and tackle opportunity, as well as our significant collective understanding of the factors that allow public companies to be successful and well-received by market participants, leads us to believe that more sustained value creation beyond the initial transaction is possible. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Compelling Thesis on Healthcare Infrastructure. Our team has extensive interactions with the broader economy. We have developed a specific worldview on how healthcare will evolve as a result of societal and economic changes. In addition, complexity associated with healthcare payment mechanics are well understood by the management team and provide for a deeper understanding of the opportunity set available to the company. We believe this viewpoint and industry perspective enables us to successfully source and structure potential deals as well as ultimately drive growth and create value through continued innovation, partnerships and relationships, among other growth factors.

Industry Opportunity



While we may acquire a business in any industry or sector, our focus is on the healthcare infrastructure sector in the United States and other developed countries. We believe that the “picks and shovels” of healthcare is an extremely attractive opportunity given the funding in 2020 and beyond from both the private and public sectors for healthcare and biotech companies.



2020 was indeed the year of COVID-19. But it was also the year of funding for the healthcare industry. The combination of venture, growth, and public financings reached historically high levels. Driven by low interest rates, change-driven innovation, and the democratization of becoming public, up and coming healthcare companies filled their coffers with cash, ensuring many years of fully-funded research & development and technical advances.

Concurrently, science emerged as the real hero of 2020. The success of messenger RNA enabled vaccines to go from concept to lab to clinic to approval in less than a year. This astonishing accomplishment led to a renewed appreciation for life sciences. It seemed as if primary issuance of new life sciences shares occurred daily. As of the end of 2020, the life sciences industry was flush with funds like never before.



Digital healthcare delivery experienced similar dynamics in 2020. There was an enormous amount of new capital raised especially for those providing services to consumers. However, the ability to bring these offerings to consumers in scale, utilize the derived data, and develop relationships with established payers such as insurance companies and Medicare has not occurred to a material extent. The infrastructure is not in place yet for consumers to fully move away from their established providers and established habits.



One key for these cutting-edge biotech or digital services companies to succeed is to stick to their core competencies which means outsourcing non mission-critical functions to trusted outsourcing partners. From conducting clinical trials to manufacturing to revenue life cycle management to electronic health records, life sciences and healthcare firms rely on an existing healthcare ecosystem or infrastructure to complete their missions. In services, more often than not, innovation is digital, requiring a new infrastructure that has not existed before in scale but is rapidly developing now. Electronic medical records, genomic sequencing, and telehealth are examples of the enormous impact new digitally capable business models have on today’s health care system.



The next few years will witness the dramatic leap forward in life sciences and digital health care models. Driven by both 2020’s funding and the COVID-19 experience, these firms are poised to succeed. Moreover, the model of delivery to the patient must change. The United States spends ~20% of its GDP on healthcare, which is significantly more than any other nation. In addition, more of this payment burden is being placing on consumers through high deductibles and out-of-network services. The only way to maintain the high quality of healthcare that consumers have come to expect as a birthright while flattening the curve of rising healthcare costs is through bringing the same style of innovation that has occurred in every other sector in the economy to the infrastructure of the healthcare world.



We hope to identify a target, or several, that falls in the sweet spot of these important trends.



Key Industry Considerations




● | Large Target Market. The healthcare industry represents an enormous target market. Total U.S. national health expenditure exceeded $3.5 trillion in 2018, and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services has estimated that total healthcare spending will approach 20-25% of total U.S. Gross Domestic Product over the coming years. As of August 2019, the number of private companies in the healthcare industry is significant, with over 55,000 operating companies focused on various sub-sectors of the healthcare services continuum in the U.S. alone. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Favorable Macro Trends. Total global healthcare expenditure has continued to grow recently at a pace substantially above the rate of inflation, and this growth is projected to continue, spurred by an aging population, increased prevalence of chronic disease, and improved access to healthcare. While the magnitude of healthcare spending continues to grow, this expense has put significant pressure on public, private, and individual payors. This dynamic has offered opportunities to companies that can control cost and/or improve the overall quality of healthcare. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increased Public Sector Spending. Events like the COVID-19 pandemic have contributed to increasing dislocation and rapid evolution across the healthcare landscape. This has exposed the lack of public healthcare infrastructure in addressing the first national pandemic in 100 years. Similar to the response of the federal government post 9-11 we believe the next decade will be characterized by significantly more government spending and mandate for healthcare, which has bi-partisan support. This will be especially pronounced through infrastructure initiatives and public health data modernization.

● | Expansive Universe of Targets. We focus our investment effort broadly across the healthcare industry, with an emphasis on the full continuum of healthcare services, healthcare information technology, supply chain or business support services, medical technology, medical devices, and diagnostics. We believe that our investment and operating expertise in healthcare across multiple industry verticals give us a large, addressable universe of potential targets. The diversity of the target universe and the number of sub-sectors maximize the likelihood that the management team will be able to identify and execute an attractive transaction. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Acquisition Strategy



Our acquisition strategy is to identify and partner with a target in the healthcare infrastructure industry and to help transform that enterprise into a successful public company. We focus on targets that may provide digital and/or physical services to key healthcare industry participants, including services providers, device and pharmaceutical manufacturers, medical technology companies, and supply chain companies. Furthermore, we focus on companies that are generating cost savings and improving efficiency and quality of care for the healthcare industry.



Our selection process leverages our deep experiences as public and private equity investors and our networks of relationships with industry leaders, private equity and venture capital firms, strategic partners, and other service providers to give us multiple avenues to develop acquisition opportunities. Our objective is to source the highest quality targets while avoiding competitive auction processes. Targets may include late-stage growth companies that need sizable capital injections to aggressively capture a nascent market opportunity; family-owned businesses seeking to facilitate generational transfer without complete monetization; business units of enterprises seeking both independence and dedicated funding; negative cashflow growth companies; and sponsor-owned companies pursuing recapitalization.



Acquisition Criteria



Consistent with our acquisition strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines.

● | Attractive Business Model. Among the criteria that we emphasize in evaluating our acquisition targets are significant existing and/or potential recurring revenue streams, strong steady-state margins, opportunities for operational improvement, and attractive free cash flow characteristics, including low capital intensity and strong free cash flow conversion. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Strong Competitive Position. We focus on acquisition targets that have existing demonstrable and sustainable competitive advantages, with a clear path to sustain and/or develop a leading market position in their respective industries. Furthermore, we focus on industries or niches that have high barriers to entry and that we believe exhibit rational competitive behaviors over the short, medium, and long term. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Innovative Product and/or Service Offerings. We seek to acquire one or more businesses that have innovative product and/or service offerings that serve to lower costs and improve efficiency and quality for customers. This may involve identifying targets with technology-driven business models that seek to improve or replace incumbent and/or physically-driven solutions. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Compelling Growth Outlook. We seek to acquire one or more businesses that have the potential for significant growth. The targets that we seek to focus on have large total addressable markets; clear secular growth drivers over the short, medium, and long term; avenues for growth from exploiting existing opportunities and expanding into adjacent markets and new geographies; and significant potential to pursue synergistic acquisitions and drive outsized inorganic top-line growth. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Experienced Management Team. We focus on target businesses that have complete, experienced management teams with a vision for creating a substantially larger enterprise. Furthermore, we focus on acquisition opportunities in which the management team of the target have substantial equity ownership in the newly public company and is aligned with us and incentivized to create long-term shareholder value. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Benefits from Long-Term Sponsorship. We intend to acquire a company that we believe will benefit from our differentiated industry network, brand, and value creation capabilities. We seek to partner with a potential target’s management team and anticipate that the financial and operational experience of our management team and board will enhance a target company’s ability to grow and succeed as a public company. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Benefits from Being a Public Company. We intend to acquire one or more businesses that will benefit from being a public company as a result of a lower cost of capital, an enhanced public profile, and the ability to use publicly-traded stock-based compensation to attract and retain employees, among other things. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors, and criteria that our management team may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the SEC.



Our Acquisition Process



In evaluating a prospective target business, we conduct a thorough due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information that will be made available to us.



We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent and disinterested directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, or from an independent accounting firm, that such initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.



Members of our management team directly or indirectly own our securities, and accordingly, they may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.



Our officers and directors are from time to time made aware of potential business opportunities, one or more of which we may desire to pursue, for a business combination, but we have not (nor has anyone on our behalf) contacted any prospective target business or had any substantive discussions, formal or otherwise, with respect to a business combination transaction with us.





6







Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional fiduciary, contractual or other obligations or duties to one or more other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entities. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for one or more entities to which he or she has fiduciary, contractual or other obligations or duties, he or she will honor these obligations and duties to present such business combination opportunity to such entities first, and only present it to us if such entities reject the opportunity and he or she determines to present the opportunity to us.



We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary, contractual or other obligations or duties of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue.



In addition, our sponsor and our officers and directors may sponsor or form other special purpose acquisition companies similar to ours or may pursue other business or investment, even prior to us entering into a definitive agreement for our initial business combination. Any such companies, businesses or investments may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an initial business combination. However, we do not believe that any such potential conflicts would materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination.



We will either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may elect to redeem their public shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination or don’t vote at all, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their public shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of our proposed business combination or allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. If we decide to allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of such business combination and, if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. We have no specified maximum percentage threshold for conversions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and even those public stockholders who vote in favor of our initial business combination have the right to convert their public shares. As a result, this may make it easier for us to consummate our initial business combination.



Initial Business Combination



Nasdaq rules require that an initial business combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes, if permitted, and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting discount). We refer to this as the 80% of net assets test. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. Additionally, pursuant to Nasdaq rules, any initial business combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we are not then listed on Nasdaq, these rules will not be applicable to us. We do not currently intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination, although there is no assurance that will be the case.



We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own or acquire shares will own or acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in our initial business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target, or issue a substantial number of new shares to third-parties in connection with financing our initial business combination. In such cases, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired by us is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If our initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.





7







We are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination.



Competition



We encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other blank check companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire.



Many of these individuals and entities are well-established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial resources are relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable is limited by our available financial resources. Our sponsor or any of its affiliates may make additional investments in us, although our sponsor has no obligation or other duty to do so. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating and completing an initial business combination.



Human Capital Resources



We currently have one officer and do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that any such person devotes in any time period to our company will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process.

Periodic Reporting and Financial Information



We have registered our units, Class A common stock and public warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accounting firm.



We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, GAAP or IFRS, depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with PCAOB standards. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such financial statements in time for us to disclose such financial statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. While this may limit the pool of potential business combination candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.



We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements on our internal control over financial reporting. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.



We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter; and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.



Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter.
