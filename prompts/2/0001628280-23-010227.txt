ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
Greenidge is a vertically integrated cryptocurrency datacenter and power generation company that owns and operates facilities at two locations with a mining capacity of 76 MW: the Town of Torrey, New York (the "New York Facility") and Spartanburg, South Carolina (the "South Carolina Facility, together with our New York Facility, the "facilities"). In 2022, our continuing operations were comprised of two primary revenue sources.
Cryptocurrency Datacenters. As of the year ended December 31, 2022 and through the signing of Hosting Agreements (as defined below) on January 30, 2023, our cryptocurrency datacenter operations generated revenue in the form of bitcoin by earning bitcoin as rewards and transaction fees for supporting the global bitcoin network with application-specific integrated circuit computers ("ASICs" or "miners") owned or leased by us. We converted substantially all of our earned bitcoin into U.S. dollars. 
On January 30, 2023, as part of an overall debt restructuring, Greenidge transferred ownership of miners with capacity of approximately 2.8 EH/s to its lender, NYDIG ABL LLC ("NYDIG"), in exchange for a reduction of debt. Concurrently, Greenidge and certain NYDIG affiliates entered into hosting agreements, whereby Greenidge agreed to host, power and provide technical support services, and other related services to NYDIG's affiliates miners at its two facilities (the "Hosting Agreements"). See "Hosting Agreements" for further details.
Greenidge owns approximately 10,000 miners with a capacity of approximately 1.1 EH/s. Greenidge is actively pursuing opportunities to install and operate these miners, which may be in arrangements where those miners would be hosted by a third party. Greenidge’s ownership of these miners did not change as a result of the aforementioned debt restructuring.
Hosting Agreements.  On January 30, 2023, Greenidge entered into the Hosting Agreements, which resulted in a material change to our business strategy with us largely operating miners owned by NYDIG affiliates. Under these agreements, we agreed to host, power and provide technical support services, and other related services, to NYDIG affiliates’ mining equipment at certain Greenidge facilities for a term of five years. The terms of such arrangements requires NYDIG affiliates to pay a reimbursement fee that covers the cost of power and direct costs associated with management of the mining facilities, a hosting fee as well as a gross profit-sharing arrangement. Under the Hosting Agreements, NYDIG affiliates are required to provide Greenidge an upfront security deposit, pay a configuration fee for the setup of new or relocated miners, and pay for repairs and parts consumed in non-routine maintenance (i.e., units that are out of service for more than 12 hours). Greenidge shall pay NYDIG a portion of capacity revenue, as well as a portion of the gross margin from any energy sales in excess of mining requirement. Additionally, when market conditions dictate shutting down mining and making market sales of energy, Greenidge shall pay NYDIG the expected value that it would have received as if the cryptocurrency datacenter had operated and a portion of gross margin from energy sales above normal mining requirements. This allows us to participate in the upside as bitcoin prices rise, but reduces our downside risk of bitcoin price deterioration and cost increases related to natural gas. The arrangement covers all of our current mining capacity at the New York and South Carolina facilities. Greenidge expects to deploy its approximately 10,000 miners, with capacity of approximately 1.1 EH/s, disclosed above at third-party hosted facilities during 2023. 
Independent Electric Generation. We own and operate a 106 MW power generation facility that is connected to the New York Independent Systems Operator (the "NYISO"), which operates New York state’s power grid. The aforementioned debt restructuring did not alter our ownership of this facility and we plan to continue to operate such facility. We sell electricity to the NYISO at all times when the plant is running and we increase or decrease the amount of electricity sold based on prevailing prices in the wholesale electricity market and demand for electricity. Based upon levels of demand and prevailing prices for electricity, we may temporarily curtail operations at our cryptocurrency datacenter located at our power generation facility in order to meet the demand for electricity. Revenue generated from the wholesale power market is variable and depends on several factors including but not limited to the supply and demand for electricity, generation capacity in the market and the prevailing price of natural gas. In addition, we receive revenues from the sale of our capacity and ancillary services in the NYISO wholesale market. Through these sales, we generate three revenue streams:
◦Energy revenue: When dispatched by the NYISO, we receive energy revenue based on the hourly price of power.
◦Capacity revenue: We receive capacity revenue for committing to sell power to the NYISO when dispatched.
◦Ancillary services revenue: When selected by the NYISO, we receive compensation for the provision of operating reserves.
Our datacenter operations in New York are powered by electricity generated directly by our power plant, which is referred to as "behind-the-meter" power as it is not subject to transmission and distribution charges from local utilities. As of December 31, 2022, our owned ASICs at the New York Facility had the capacity to consume approximately 56 MW of electricity. We have approval from NYISO to utilize 64 MW of electricity behind-the-meter.
Support Services. On September 14, 2021, GGH Merger Sub, Inc. ("Merger Sub"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Greenidge, merged with and into Support.com, Inc. ("Support.com"), with Support.com continuing as the surviving corporation (the "Merger") and a wholly owned subsidiary of Greenidge, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated March 19, 2021 (the "Merger Agreement"), among Greenidge, Support.com and Merger Sub. At the effective time of the Merger, we issued 2,960,731 shares of class A common stock in exchange for all shares of common stock, par value $0.0001, of Support.com and all outstanding stock option and restricted stock units of Support.com. Support.com’s results of operations and balance sheet have been consolidated effective with the Merger. See Note 3, "Merger with Support.com", in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of the Merger.
Effective September 14, 2021, following the completion of the Merger, Support.com began operating as a separate operating and reporting segment. Our Support Services segment provided solutions and technical programs to customers delivered by home-based employees. The Support Services segment provided customer service, sales support, and technical support primarily to large corporations, businesses and professional services organizations. The Support Services segment also earned revenues for end-user software products provided through direct customer downloads and sale via partners. The Support Services segment operated primarily in the United States, but maintained international operations that included staff providing support services. 
Support.com’s largest customer elected to not renew their contract with Support.com upon its expiration on December 31, 2022. As a result of this development, management and the Board of Directors decided to strictly focus on its cryptocurrency datacenter and power generation operations and made the determination to consider various strategic alternatives for the Support.com segment, including but not limited to the potential disposition of assets. We have classified the Support.com business as held for sale and discontinued operations in these consolidated financial statements as a result of a strategic shift at the parent level to strictly focus on our cryptocurrency datacenter and power generation operations, including pursuant to the Hosting Agreements. On January 17, 2023, Greenidge completed the sale of certain assets of Support.com for net proceeds of approximately $2.6 million as the first step in the disposal of the Support.com segment assets. The Company is actively pursuing the sale of the remaining portion of the Support.com business which includes the existing active customer contracts, information technology platforms including the website, and the remaining workforce. 
Corporate History and Structure
In 2014, Atlas Holdings LLC and its affiliates ("Atlas") formed Greenidge Generation Holdings LLC ("GGH") and purchased all of the equity interests in Greenidge Generation LLC ("Greenidge Generation"), which owned an idled power plant in the Town of Torrey, New York.
Following the purchase and prior to commencing revenue generating operations, Greenidge Generation began the process of converting the power plant from being fueled by coal to being fueled by natural gas. This project required procuring and installing new equipment to convert its boiler and securing the right of way to construct an approximately 4.6-mile natural gas pipeline which we now own and operate. In addition, the project required a series of approvals and permits from various New York State and federal government agencies which took approximately 2.5 years to complete.
In May 2017, the transformed power plant commenced operations with a total generation capacity of approximately 106 MW.
In 2018, our management began exploring additional opportunities to utilize the unique attributes of our asset base to strengthen the company and to create a more valuable economic driver for the region.
In May 2019, after identifying cryptocurrency datacenter operations as a potential business opportunity, we constructed a pilot cryptocurrency datacenter and began operating approximately 1 MW of bitcoin mining capacity. 
After the success of our pilot project, we constructed, within the existing plant, a larger scale data center and commenced operations in January 2020 with approximately 287 Petahash, or 287 X 1015 hash, per second ("PH/s") of capacity. 
In January 2021, GGH completed a corporate restructuring. Pursuant to this restructuring, Greenidge was incorporated in the State of Delaware on January 27, 2021 and on January 29, 2021, we entered into an asset contribution and exchange 
agreement with the owners of GGH, pursuant to which we acquired all of the ownership interests in GGH in exchange for 7,000,000 shares of our common stock. As a result of this transaction, GGH became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Greenidge.
On September 14, 2021, we acquired Support.com pursuant to the Merger and it began to operate as our wholly-owned subsidiary. Subsequent to the Merger, our shares of class A common stock were listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and currently trade under the symbol "GREE." On December 13, 2022, we received a letter from the listing qualifications department of the Nasdaq Stock Market ("Nasdaq") notifying us that for the prior 30 consecutive business days the bid price of our common stock had closed below $1.00 per share, the minimum closing bid price required by the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq listing rules. We have until June 12, 2023 to regain compliance or we may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar days to comply with the Bid Price Requirement (as defined below), subject to Nasdaq approval. See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Securities—Our class A common stock is subject to delisting proceedings from the Nasdaq Global Select Market."
Throughout 2021, we increased our datacenter capacity from 0.4 EH/s to approximately 1.4 EH/s, and in 2022, we increased our active mining capacity to 2.4 EH/s, with a total fleet capacity with a nameplate of 3.9 EH/s as of December 31, 2022.
On December 31, 2022, we classified the Support.com business as held for sale and discontinued operations.
On January 30, 2023, we entered into a debt restructuring agreement with our primary lender NYDIG, which included the transfer of approximately 2.8 EH/S of bitcoin mining equipment to NYDIG. Concurrently, we entered into bitcoin mining hosting agreements with NYDIG's affiliates to host, power and provide technical support services, and other related services, to NYDIG's mining equipment at data centers operated by us for a period of five years, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the terms of the Hosting Agreements. 
Cryptocurrency Datacenter Industry
Introduction to Bitcoin, the Bitcoin Network and Bitcoin Mining
Bitcoin is a digital asset created and transmitted through the operations of a peer-to-peer network of computers, known as the bitcoin network. The bitcoin network is decentralized, meaning that no single entity owns or operates the bitcoin network, and that no governmental authority, financial institution, or financial intermediary is required to create, transmit or determine the value of bitcoin. Instead, the infrastructure of the bitcoin network is owned and maintained by a decentralized user base. The bitcoin network allows people to exchange digital tokens of value, called bitcoins, which are recorded on a publicly distributed transaction ledger known as a blockchain. The bitcoin blockchain is a digital, publicly distributed bookkeeping ledger that holds a record of every bitcoin transaction since the inception of bitcoin, with each block containing information relating to a group of bitcoin transactions.
Bitcoin is created and allocated by the bitcoin network protocol as a reward for validating and verifying bitcoin transactions, securing transaction blocks and adding those transaction blocks to the bitcoin blockchain using computer processing power to solve complex algorithms based on cryptographic protocols. The aforementioned actions are often referred to as "mining" as those performing the actions are paid in newly created bitcoin. The persons or machines that are rewarded in newly created bitcoin are often referred to as "miners." Each unique block in the bitcoin blockchain can be solved and added to the bitcoin blockchain by only one miner. Once a miner solves a block, the rest of the miners in the network verify the solution and confirm the block to the blockchain.
As an incentive to incur the time and computational costs of mining, the miner who correctly solves the algorithm resulting in a block being added to the bitcoin blockchain is rewarded in newly created bitcoin (known as a block reward) and will also receive any transaction fees paid by transferors whose transactions are recorded in the block. An infinite amount of blocks can be solved; however, the amount of block rewards paid to miners is on a managed distribution schedule which will result in the last block reward payout occurring approximately in 2140. At that time, miners will be incentivized to maintain the network solely based on transaction fees.
Performance Metrics—Network Hash Rate and Difficulty
In bitcoin mining, the processing speed of a bitcoin miner is measured by its "hash rate" or "hashes per second." "Hash rate" is the speed at which a miner can take any set of information and process it via the algorithm used on the bitcoin network, also known as a "hash." Therefore, a miner’s hash rate refers to how many algorithmic computations the miner can perform per second on the bitcoin network. 
An individual mining company like ours has a hash rate measured across the total number of the miners it deploys in its datacenter operations. Generally, an individual miner’s expected success rate in solving blocks and realizing bitcoin rewards over time is correlated with its proportion of the total network hash rate over the same period.
"Difficulty" is a measure of the relative complexity of the algorithmic solution required to create a block and receive a bitcoin award. The bitcoin network protocol adjusts the network difficulty periodically based on the aggregate amount of hashing power deployed by the network with a goal of it requiring 10 minutes, on average, to create a new bitcoin block. At each interval of 2,016 blocks (which takes roughly two weeks), the network re-analyzes the interval and revises the difficulty index, if needed. If the block formation time for the preceding 2,016 blocks exceeds the 10-minute average goal, the network automatically reduces the degree of difficulty and vice versa.
Mining Pools
A significant portion of the global hash rate on the bitcoin network has been contributed to a number of "mining pools." In a typical bitcoin mining pool, groups of miners combine their resources, or hash rate, and earn bitcoin together. Mining pools help to smooth the variability of the revenue stream of individual miners by combining the hash rate from multiple miners and then paying each miner a pro rata share of the aggregate bitcoin rewards generated by the combined pool. 
The mining pool operator is typically paid a fee for maintaining the pool. As discussed below, we participate in mining pools as an integral part of our business. Miners who participate in mining pools are expected to earn their pro rata share of the global bitcoin rewards received by all miners on the bitcoin network, less any fees paid to the mining pool operator.
Bitcoin Mining Power Requirements
When the bitcoin network was created, initially, individuals interested in bitcoin mining were able to do so using personal computers. However, as bitcoin’s value and popularity have increased over time, so too has the aggregate hashing power deployed in the bitcoin network. The bitcoin network has grown to the point where it is generally no longer economical to mine bitcoin without ASIC computers with strong computing abilities and energy efficiency. 
Operating a fleet of ASIC bitcoin miners on a commercial scale currently requires a significant amount of electricity. The amount of electricity required is dependent on the number and types of miners online and the energy demand for each type of miner, as each type of miner has a specific electricity efficiency measured by comparing its hash rate output to its electrical consumption.
Bitcoin Mining Economics
The bitcoin network is designed in such a way that the reward for adding new blocks to the blockchain decreases over time. The number of bitcoin awarded for solving a new block is automatically halved after every 210,000 blocks. Each block takes approximately 10 minutes to be solved and as a result, rewards are halved approximately every four years. Currently, the fixed reward for solving a new block is 6.25 bitcoin per block and this number is expected to decrease by half to become 3.125 bitcoin sometime in 2024.
The profitability of a bitcoin mining operation largely depends on:
•the price of bitcoin;
•the cost of electricity;
•the efficiency of mining equipment;
•a miner's proportionate share of the global hash rate; and
•a miner's other fixed and variable costs including labor, overhead and fixed and variable fees paid to third parties, if any, associated with bitcoin mining operations.
Electricity Cost Structure
Our power plant is strategically located in the Town of Torrey, New York and is connected to the Empire Pipeline. The Empire Pipeline provides our power plant with ready access to the Millennium Pipeline price hub, which provides relatively low market rates for natural gas. As a result of our strategic geographic location, we have access to a regular 
supply of relatively lower-cost natural gas to power our electricity generation. We entered into a contract for firm gas transportation on the Empire Pipeline, ensuring we have uninterrupted access to fuel. Further, the Millennium Pipeline price hub is a liquid market that allows us to hedge our purchases of this natural gas fuel opportunistically, mitigating the risk to our business from price fluctuations.
Our data center in South Carolina is set on a 175-acre site which currently has approximately 20 MW of mining capacity. We purchase power from a supplier of approximately 60% zero-carbon sourced energy, which results in a relatively stable energy and cost environment. 
Mining Pool Participation
As part of our mining operations, we currently contribute our hash rate to certain mining pools, subject to their terms of service. Such participation is generally terminable at any time by either party, and our risk is limited by our ability to switch pools at any time or simply not to participate in any pools and mine independently. In exchange for providing computing power, we receive a share of the theoretical global mining rewards based on our percent contribution to the bitcoin mining network, less fees payable to the pool. The mining pools in which we currently participate allocate their bitcoin to us on a daily basis. This bitcoin revenue is delivered to us electronically, and we liquidate it into U.S. dollars within a relatively short time following receipt. We had stored some bitcoin at a third-party custody provider using electronic storage not connected to the internet, or "cold storage," but we liquidated this previously stored bitcoin into U.S. dollars in early 2023.
Products and Services
Cryptocurrency Datacenter Operations
We began mining bitcoin in 2019 with the construction of a pilot datacenter to operate approximately 9 PH/s of bitcoin mining capacity located at our New York Facility. We launched a commercial data center for bitcoin mining and blockchain services in January 2020, and as of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 24,200 miners deployed on our two sites capable of producing an aggregate hash rate capacity of approximately 2.4 EH/s. Although the number of miners deployed provides a sense of scale of cryptocurrency datacenter operations as compared to our peers, management believes that hash rate, or the number of hashes a miner can perform in each second, typically expressed in EH/s or terahash per second ("TH/s") and used as a measure of computational power or mining capacity used to mine and process transactions on a blockchain such as bitcoin, provides a more comparable measure of a cryptocurrency datacenter fleet’s ability to process cryptocurrency transactions as compared to other bitcoin mining operations.
On January 30, 2023, we signed the Hosting Agreements and will generate revenue through hosting fees, which include a profit sharing component. As of January 30, 2023, we continue to own approximately 10,000 miners with a capacity of approximately 1.1 EH/s, and we will be evaluating options to install these miners at facilities that are hosted by third parties.
Power Generation Operations
We sell capacity, energy and ancillary services from our approximately 106 MW nameplate capacity power generation facility and sell power that we generate, at wholesale, to the NYISO when dispatched, based on the NYISO’s daily supply and demand needs. We began our energy sales in 2017 when our power generation facility came back online after converting from a coal-fired to a natural gas-fired facility. We sell a contractual minimum amount of electricity to NYISO at all times our New York Facility is operating. We participate in the daily power bidding process and will increase the amount of power sold to the grid when the market rates are favorable to do so. At times, we curtail mining to increase the amount of capacity sold to the grid when it is the more profitable revenue stream based on the daily market rates. 
We have a contract with Empire Pipeline Inc., which provides for the firm transportation to our pipeline of up to 15,000 dekatherms of natural gas per day. The natural gas is transported to our captive lateral pipeline through which this gas is transported 4.6 miles to our power plant. We have contracts with Emera Energy covering both the purchase of natural gas and the bidding and sale of electricity through the NYISO.
These sales accounted for approximately 18% and 10% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
The Power Generation Industry in New York State
Wholesale markets for energy, capacity and ancillary services in New York State are administered by the NYISO. With respect to wholesale sales of electricity, generators bid into the market the quantity of electricity that they are prepared to produce for each hour of the following day and the corresponding price. Generators’ bids are subject to bid caps and mitigation rules administered by the NYISO, both of which are designed to ensure that the total bid submitted to the NYISO properly reflects market conditions. Distribution utilities and other load serving entities decide how much electricity they wish to purchase for each hour of the following day and how much they are willing to pay for that electricity. The NYISO then selects the proper mix of generators to supply the hourly demand at the least cost while meeting applicable requirements to maintain a reliable electric system. Prices for capacity and ancillary services are also set by the interplay between supply and demand in bid-based markets administered by the NYISO, except in the case of certain ancillary services for which the NYISO’s Market Administration and Control Area Services Tariff establishes cost-based rates.
Competition
Competition in Datacenter Operations and Power Generation Segment
Datacenter Operations
The cryptocurrency industry is a highly competitive and evolving industry, and new competitors or emerging technologies could enter the market and affect our competitiveness in the future. Operators of bitcoin miners can range from individual enthusiasts to commercial mining operations with dedicated datacenters. Miners often organize themselves in mining pools. We compete with several public and private companies that focus all or a portion of their activities on bitcoin mining and hosting. 
Power Generation in New York
The NYISO operates bid-based wholesale markets for electric energy, capacity and other generation-related services such as reactive power support and frequency control. We are authorized to participate in all of these markets, where our bids are evaluated along with bids from numerous other generating facilities in or near New York State. In each of these markets, the NYISO sets the market price, which is paid to all bidders, based on the highest priced bid accepted to meet demand.
We compete against all other NYISO generation resources, which as of Summer 2022 included approximately 41,000 MW of installed capacity consisting of gas and oil-fired thermal generation, as well as nuclear, hydro, wind, and other renewable generation. Our competitiveness is based on our variable cost compared to the marginal price in the energy markets as set by the bid of the highest- price resource required to satisfy load requirements. The primary determinants of our variable cost are its efficiency (e.g. how much gas is required to produce a given unit of power) and fuel cost.
Our variable cost relative to the marginal energy price determines how much power we sell. The marginal energy price increases as demand for power increases and as more expensive generation resources are required to satisfy load requirements. We benefit from retirements of less expensive generation resources in the NYISO and conversely, become less competitive as more efficient generation capacity is added.
A similar dynamic exists in the capacity markets where we are a price-taker. An administratively-determined sloping demand curve ensures that the price paid to suppliers of capacity declines as capacity exceeds reliability requirements. Thus, as other generation capacity retires, we will benefit from higher prices and conversely, as other generation capacity is added, we will realize lower capacity revenues. The capacity market is designed to incentivize generation additions when reserve margins (excess capacity relative to peak demand) are low and to reduce capacity payments made to generators when reserve margins are high and there is excess capacity.
Competitive Advantages
Electricity is the largest input cost for most cryptocurrency datacenter operations, and we believe owning a power generation facility provides us with a competitive advantage in our cryptocurrency datacenter operations. We believe that our business benefits from the following additional competitive advantages:
•Vertical integration. We believe there are relatively few other public companies in the United States with cryptocurrency datacenter operations of scale in the United States currently using power generated from their own power plants.
•Hosting arrangements. The terms of our hosting arrangements require NYDIG to pay a hosting fee that covers the cost of power and a hosting fee associated with direct costs of mining facilities management, as well as a gross profit-sharing arrangement. This allows us to participate in the upside as bitcoin prices rise, but reduces our downside risk of bitcoin price deterioration and cost increases related to natural gas. 
•Low power costs. Through access to the Millennium Pipeline price hub that provides relatively low market rates for natural gas and the relatively cool climate where our power plant is located, we are able to produce our energy at competitive rates and largely avoid the extra cost of active cooling of the cryptocurrency datacenter operations. Our hosting arrangements have reduced the downside risk to us from cost increases related to natural gas.
•Power market upside. Being online 24/7 allows us to optimize between hosting, power and cryptocurrency datacenter revenue.
•Self-reliance. All of the power that we use in our New York state cryptocurrency datacenter operations is provided by behind-the-meter generation with no reliance on third-party power purchase agreements that can be modified or revoked at any time.
•Cryptocurrency experience. We have been active as operators of cryptocurrency datacenters for over two years which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage over new entrants that have not commenced commercial cryptocurrency datacenter operations. Having engineers and electricians on staff has enabled us to design our own mining architecture, which in turn allows us to operate and maintain our mining operations. We believe this leads to better performance.
•Institutional backing. Our controlling stockholder, Atlas, is affiliated with an investment firm with more than $6.8 billion of assets under management and prior experience owning and operating more than 2,000 MW of power generation assets.
Intellectual Property
We do not currently own any patents, trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights and other intellectual property rights in connection with our existing and planned bitcoin mining related operations. 
Environmental, Social, Governance
We are committed to making progress on the issues that matter in the environmental, social, and governance areas, and more specifically to serving as a community partner in the locations in which we operate. This is a critical part of our plan for growth and value creation as we develop our business. In 2022, we donated to local community developments including the construction of a new playground in Dresden, NY and to initiatives for the preservation of Yates County history, as well as numerous other sponsorships of local initiatives. 
We participate in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative ("RGGI"), a market-based program in which participating states sell carbon dioxide ("CO2") allowances through auctions and invest proceeds in energy efficiency, renewable energy, and other consumer benefit programs to spur innovation in the clean energy economy and create local green jobs. We purchase RGGI allowances each year to cover 100% of our CO2 emitted from power generation and have done so since we began gas-fired operations in 2017.
The RGGI requires, by law, that we remit credits to offset 50% of our annual emission expense in the following year, for each of the years in the three year control period (i.e., the Fourth Control period being January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2020). In February 2021, we remitted emissions allowances for the control period. We continue to remit credits in accordance with RGGI under the current three-year control period (i.e., the Fifth Control Period being January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2023). We recognize expense on a per ton basis, where one ton is equal to one RGGI credit. RGGI credits 
are recorded on a first in, first out basis. We incurred emissions expenses of $4.5 million and $2.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which was allocated between cost of revenue - cryptocurrency datacenter and cost of revenue - power and capacity, based on the relative percentage of MWH consumed for each, in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
We completed the installation of cylindrical wedge wire screens at the water intake system for our New York Facility. The completion of the wedge wire screens represents another critical milestone in Greenidge’s extensive efforts to meet or exceed all of New York State’s nation-leading environmental standards. We began work on the project in 2017, shortly after receiving a water discharge permit from New York State Department of Environmental Conservation ("NYSDEC"). Greenidge was required to meet strict deadlines established by NYSDEC over the course of the project, including years of detailed study, comprehensive sampling, a pilot study, development of a verification monitoring plan and more. Additionally, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has reviewed relevant components of the project and issued approval. We met all government deadlines throughout the extensive regulatory process and were permitted to complete the installation of the wedge wire screens after final NYSDEC and Federal approvals were granted on September 26, 2022 and October 7, 2022, respectively. We invested more than $6 million in the required processes, including the study, design and installation, necessary to complete the wedge wire screen project, which reflect the Best Technology Available according to NYSDEC, and other Greenidge State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System ("SPDES") permit requirements. The construction work was completed by workers from local unions, including members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 840, Dockbuilders and Timbermen Local 1556, Carpenters Western New York Local Union 276, International Union of Operating Engineers Local 158 & 150 and Millwrights Local 1163.
From time to time we have purchased voluntary carbon offsets from a portfolio of U.S. greenhouse gas reduction projects as one method to reduce our carbon footprint. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we purchased $1.0 million of voluntary carbon offset credits.
Seasonality
Our business is not generally subject to seasonality. However, coin generation from our mining operations may vary depending on our total hash rate at a given point in time relative to the total hash rate of bitcoin. Our power revenue may vary due to external factors impacting supply and demand of electricity in the region including demand due to seasonal weather.
Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2022, we had 347 employees, of which Greenidge employed 65 and Support.com employed 282. We had 132 employees based outside of the United States. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe our relationship with our employees is satisfactory. 
Workplace Health and Safety
The safety and health of our employees is a top priority for us. We are committed to maintaining an effective safety culture and to stressing the importance of our employees’ role in identifying, mitigating and communicating safety risks. We believe that the achievement of superior safety performance is both an important short-term and long-term strategic initiative in managing our operations. In this regard, our policies and operational practices promote a culture where all levels of employees are responsible for safety.
Government Regulation
Greenidge Generation holds a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity issued by the NYS Public Service Commission (the "PSC") under section 68 of the Public Service Law. In addition, it has been granted lightened regulation by the PSC and Market Based Rate Authority by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the "FERC")authorizing it to enter into sales of power in interstate commerce at market-based rates. It is connected to the New York State Electric & Gas Corporation ("NYSEG") transmission system by virtue of the Large Generation Interconnection Agreement among Greenidge Generation, the NYSEG and the NYISO. All environmental permits are set forth below.
We are a Public Utility Holding Company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 ("PUHCA"), and have applied for and received exemption from the record keeping and records inspection regulations of PUHCA.
One of our subsidiaries, Greenidge Pipeline LLC ("Greenidge Pipeline"), operates pursuant to a Certificate of Environmental Compatibility and Public Need issued by the PSC under Article VII of the Public Service Law. It is exempt from regulation by the FERC, under the National Gas Act ("NGA") pursuant to Section 1(c) of the NGA , due to the fact 
that all of the gas transmitted through the pipeline is delivered within the State of New York and the rates for delivery are regulated by the PSC. There are no environmental permits associated with the operation of the pipeline.
Below is a summary of the material regulations that currently apply to our business. Regulations may substantially change in the future, and it is presently not possible to know how regulations will apply to our businesses, or when they will be effective. As the regulatory and legal environment evolves, we may become subject to new laws, further regulation by the SEC, and other federal or state agencies, which may affect our cryptocurrency datacenter, power generation and other related activities. For additional discussion regarding about the potential risks existing and future regulation pose to our business, see "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business" herein.
Regulations Applicable to Cryptocurrency Datacenter Business
On November 22, 2022, New York State signed Bill S6486D into law which prohibits permits being issued for two years to proof-of-work cryptocurrency mining operations that are operated through electric generating facilities that use a carbon-based fuel. The bill prohibits the issuance of new permits and does not address existing permit renewal applications that predate the law’s effective date. Our permit application was accepted by the NYSDEC in September 2021. See "Permits" for further details. 
Government regulation of blockchain and bitcoin is being actively considered by the State of New York and the United States federal government via a number of agencies and regulatory bodies, as well as similar entities in other countries. Additional state government regulations also may apply to our cryptocurrency datacenter activities and other related activities in which we participate or may participate in the future. Certain regulatory bodies have shown an interest in regulating or investigating companies engaged in the blockchain or bitcoin business.
Regulations may substantially change in the future, and it is presently not possible to know how new regulations will apply to our businesses, or when they will be effective. As the regulatory and legal environment evolves, we may become subject to new laws, further regulation by the SEC and other federal or state agencies, which may affect our cryptocurrency datacenter and other related activities. For additional discussion regarding our belief about the potential risks existing and future regulation pose to our business, see "Risk Factors" herein.
Regulations Applicable to Power Generation Business
We operate our electricity generating business subject to the following regulatory regimes:
The New York State Public Service Commission
Greenidge, GGH LLC and Greenidge Generation are each defined as "electric corporations" subject to regulation by the PSC under New York’s Public Service Law. The PSC regulates both the issuance by electric corporations of "stocks, bonds and other evidence of indebtedness" and the purchase and sale of either the assets of or the ownership interests in electric corporations.
Greenidge Pipeline and Greenidge Pipeline Properties Corporation are "gas corporations" subject to regulation by the PSC under New York’s Public Service Law. The PSC regulates both the issuance by gas corporations of "stocks, bonds and other evidences of indebtedness" and the purchase and sale of either the assets of or the ownership interests in gas corporations.  Greenidge Pipeline and Greenidge Pipeline Properties Corporation operate their approximately 4.6 mile gas pipeline under the terms of a certificate of environmental compatibility and public need issued by the PSC. The terms of that certificate govern the safe operation of the facility and minimization of the impacts of that facility on the environment.
Greenidge Generation currently has permission from the PSC to issue up to $50 million in "indebtedness," which may include non-voting stock. To the extent that Greenidge Generation seeks to issue more than $50 million in such instruments (net of the amount of any instruments already issued), approval must be obtained from the PSC. Issuances of any such instruments by Greenidge Generation do not require the PSC’s prior approval, as long as the power generating assets held by Greenidge Generation are not pledged as security under those instruments. Currently these power generating assets are not pledged as a security under any of our outstanding debt agreements. 
The PSC has established a rebuttable presumption that a third party that is not itself an electric or gas corporation may purchase up to 10% of the ownership interests in an electric corporation without: (1) requiring PSC approval; or (2) 
becoming an electric corporation itself. This presumption may be rebutted if the facts demonstrate that an entity holding less than 10% of the ownership interests in an electric corporation is nonetheless controlling the day-to-day operations of that electric corporation. Acquisition of more than 50% of the ownership interests in an electric corporation will require PSC approval and will make the acquiring entity an electric corporation itself. Acquisitions between 10% and 50% are reviewed by the PSC on a case-by-case basis.
One exception to these requirements is that an electric or gas corporation that is under common ownership with one or more other entities may be merged with such other entities without requiring PSC approval, provided that such transaction does not result in any change in the ultimate ownership of the public utility in question.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
Greenidge Generation is a public utility subject to regulation by the FERC under the Federal Power Act (the "FPA"). Like the PSC, FERC regulates both the issuance of securities and the purchase and sale of assets and ownership interests in public utilities. The FPA generally:
1.Limits public utilities from selling, leasing or otherwise disposing of facilities with a value in excess of $10 million and used for wholesale sales of electric energy or electric transmission ("Jurisdictional Facilities") without the prior authorization of FERC, and dispositions resulting in a direct or indirect change of control over a public utility generally require prior FERC authorization. 
2.Prohibits a public utility from merging or consolidating Jurisdictional Facilities with any other public utility’s Jurisdictional Facilities with a value in excess of $10 million, without prior FERC authorization. 
3.Requires FERC authorization before a public utility may acquire any security with a value in excess of $10 million of any other public utility. 
4.Requires FERC authorization before a public utility may acquire or lease a generation facility with a value in excess of $10 million. 
5.Requires FERC approval before a holding company in a system which includes an electric transmission or generation company may acquire any security with a value in excess of $10 million of an electric transmission or generation company or a holding company with a value in excess of $10 million. 
6.Requires FERC authorization before a holding company in a system which includes an electric transmission or generation company may merge or consolidate with an electric transmission or generation company or a holding company with a value in excess of $10 million.
The FPA also requires reporting of certain asset sales which do not otherwise require FERC authorization. FERC approval would also be required in advance of a disposition or change of control over Greenidge through the sale of shares.
The FERC has granted Greenidge Generation blanket authorization to issue securities and assume obligations or liabilities as guarantor, endorser, surety, or otherwise in respect of any security of another person; provided that such issue or assumption is for some lawful object within the corporate purposes of Greenidge Generation, compatible with the public interest, and reasonably necessary or appropriate for such purposes. The FERC also administers the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005, which imposes certain record keeping and records access requirements on public utility holding companies. We are a public utility holding company but have received an exemption from these record keeping and records access requirements. Any entity acquiring more than 10% of the voting securities of either us or Greenidge Generation is likely to be regarded by FERC as a public utility holding company. Such entities can obtain an exemption from these record keeping and records access requirements if they are able to demonstrate that they are not affiliated with any jurisdictional utility that has captive customers, and that they do not own commission-jurisdictional transmission facilities or provide commission-jurisdictional transmission services and that they are not affiliated with persons that own such facilities or provide such services.
Although the gas pipeline owned and operated by Greenidge Pipeline transports gas supplies flowing in interstate commerce, it is regulated by the PSC rather than by FERC because all of the pipeline’s facilities are located in, and all of the gas it delivers is consumed in, New York State and its rates are regulated by the PSC. Accordingly, no FERC approvals are required for any financing or transfers of ownership interests in Greenidge Pipeline.
Because Greenidge Pipeline operates exclusively as a provider of delivery services for gas supplies owned by others, it is not a "gas utility company" under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 which expands the authority of FERC to 
oversee transactions and other financial activities of public utility holding companies through grants of access to those companies’ books and records. As a result, purchasers directly or indirectly acquiring 10% or more of the voting securities of Greenidge Pipeline would not become subject to the FERC records keeping and records access requirements of that law. Any such acquisition should be reviewed under FPA Section 203 and the NYPSL Section 70 to determine if an authorization is needed in advance of the transaction.
In addition, we, GGH, and Atlas and certain of its affiliates are all holding companies under the PUHCA, which is also administered by FERC. Each of these entities has filed a Notice with FERC of their exemption from the books and record-keeping requirements of PUHCA 2005 and are therefore not subject to those requirements.
A failure to comply with FERC regulatory requirements can result in penalties and in extreme cases, action to unwind a transaction or to impose criminal sanctions. See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Risks Related to our Power Generation Operations" for further details.
The New York State Independent System Operator
So long as Greenidge Generation remains the owner of the New York facility, we expect that no approvals from the NYISO should be required for any restructuring of the ownership of us or Greenidge Generation. In the event of a transfer of ownership of its facility to a new owner, the interconnection agreement with the NYISO and NYSEG currently held by Greenidge Generation can be assigned to the new owner, so long as the assignee in such a transaction directly assumes in writing all rights, duties and obligations arising under that agreement and agrees to comply with all of the NYISO’s applicable market rules.
Yates County Industrial Development Agency
Both Greenidge Generation and Greenidge Pipeline have lease/leaseback relationships in place with the Yates County Industrial Development Agency, which relationships also include a payment in lieu of tax agreement. Consent of the Yates County Industrial Development Agency would be required for both Greenidge Generation and Greenidge Pipeline for any type of merger, consolidation or change of control, which consent must be obtained prior to completion of such transaction.
The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation
The operations of each of Greenidge Generation and the landfill owned by another subsidiary of Greenidge, Lockwood Hills LLC ("Lockwood Hills"), are subject to numerous NYSDEC and EPA regulations and requirements. Lockwood Hills operates a landfill and leachate management facility (the "Landfill"). Most of the EPA requirements that Greenidge Generation and Lockwood Hills are subject to are delegated to the NYSDEC and are regulated through permits issued by NYSDEC. Future laws or regulations may require the addition of environmental controls or impose restrictions on Greenidge Generation and Lockwood Hills operations, which could affect our operations.
Complying with environmental laws often involves significant capital and operating expenses. See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Risks Related to our Datacenter and Power Generation Operations" for further details.
Permits
Greenidge Generation’s operations are subject to the following NYSDEC-issued permits: Clean Air Act Title IV and Title V permits, Clean Water Act SPDES, and New York State Water Withdrawal Permit. Greenidge Generation also holds a Petroleum Bulk Storage registration issued by NYSDEC, which includes requirements applicable to the petroleum storage tanks located at the facility. The Landfill is subject to the following NYSDEC-issued permits: SPDES Permit and Part 360 Solid Waste Management Permit. 
Air
The Clean Air Act Title IV and Title V permits authorize Greenidge Generation to fire natural gas (with up to 19% biomass co-firing) to produce electricity in accordance with the requirements of these permits. These permits regulate air emissions associated with our operations and include all applicable Clean Air Act and New York State requirements. Greenidge Generation is also subject to the RGGI, which is a multi-state cap and trade program for carbon dioxide emissions that requires Greenidge Generation to purchase one RGGI allowance for every ton of CO2 emitted from the 
facility. RGGI allowances are offered in quarterly auctions and are available from third parties. In 2019, New York State passed the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act ("CLCPA"), which requires the NYSDEC and PSC to promulgate regulations and programs for the state to meet greenhouse gas emission reduction requirements and targets. NYSDEC and PSC have not fully implemented the CLCPA.
In late June 2022, the NYSDEC announced its denial of the Title V air permit renewal for our New York Facility. We filed a notice with the NYSDEC on July 28, 2022 requesting a hearing on NYSDEC’s decision. Having timely completed our application to renew our Title V air permit, we are permitted to operate uninterrupted under a State Administrative Procedures Act extension, in full compliance with our existing Title V Air Permit, until final resolution of the adjudicatory hearing process. The adjudicatory hearing process is in its early stages, with no ruling yet on party status or the issues to be adjudicated. While no adjudicatory proceedings have been scheduled to date, we expect that the appeals process may take a number of years to fully resolve.
Water
The New York Facility is subject to SPDES and Water Withdrawal permits issued by NYSDEC for five-year terms, which include state and federal requirements applicable to withdrawal of water from Seneca Lake and discharge of process and stormwaters from the facility to the Keuka Lake Outlet and Seneca Lake. A request for renewal has been made prior to the expiration of these permits and has been deemed timely and sufficient by NYSDEC. This allows uninterrupted operation of the New York Facility under the State Administrative Procedures Act. In September 2022, NYSDEC modified our SPDES permit which granted an extension to install Best Technology Available for cooling water intake structures. We completed the installation of the Best Technology Available and began successful operation in January 2023. 
The Landfill, which is located approximately 0.4 miles from the Greenidge Generation facility, discharges stormwater and treated leachate to the Keuka Lake Outlet in accordance with a SPDES permit issued by NYSDEC. A reissued SPDES permit was completed in May 2022. This permit establishes effluent limitations and sampling frequency for both stormwater and leachate discharges from the Landfill and specifies a monitoring and reporting structure to the NYSDEC. This permit is valid until June 2027. 
Waste
The Landfill is also subject to a Part 360 Solid Waste Management Facility permit issued by NYSDEC. An application to renew and modify the Part 360 permit was submitted in August 2020 to NYSDEC, and NYSDEC is currently processing the application. Due to the operations of the previous owners of the Lockwood Hills landfill, in 2015 NYSDEC alleged that the then-existing Leachate Pond was causing exceedances of New York State groundwater standards. Lockwood Hills entered into a Consent Order with the NYSDEC in 2015, which required remediation of the leachate pond, and installation of a liner and treatment system. The work required by the Consent Order was completed in 2019 as required, and NYSDEC approved of the construction report on July 6, 2020. Applications for modification of the SPDES and Part 360 permits to reflect the implementation of the consent order, which are the final requirements of the consent order, were timely submitted to NYSDEC. Lockwood Hills is subject to EPA’s Coal Combustion Residuals Rule (the "CCR Rule"), as a coal combustion residual ("CCR") landfill. In accordance with the requirements of the CCR Rule, Lockwood has drafted required plans and documents and hosts a publicly available website that makes certain documents available to the public.
Greenidge Generation is also subject to the CCR Rule, which requires that the onsite CCR surface impoundment associated with previous coal-fired operation of the facility, be closed. Greenidge Generation has also drafted the CCR Rule documents associated with closure, and has a publicly available website that makes certain documents available to the public as required by the rule. We have evaluated the impact of the CCR Rule on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows and have accrued environmental liabilities under the rule based on current estimates.
Environmental Liability
As required by the NYSDEC, landfills are required to establish and maintain financial assurance mechanism to cover closure, post-closure care, and related expenses. The purpose of the financial assurance mechanism is to ensure the amount of funds assured is sufficient to cover the costs of landfill closure, post-closure care, custodial care, and, if necessary, corrective measures for known releases when needed. The financial assurance amount is based on written estimates, in current dollars, of the cost of hiring a third party to perform the work. The NYSDEC has allowed Atlas and its affiliates to satisfy this financial assurance obligation by maintaining a letter of credit guaranteeing the payment of the landfill liability. As of December 31, 2022, the letter of credit amount was approximately $5.0 million, which guaranteed 
the payment of a portion of the landfill liability. During 2023, Greenidge expects to contribute $1.3 million into a trust established with NYSDEC as the beneficiary to cover the remainder of the landfill surety requirement.
CCRs are subject to federal and state regulations. Most of our obligations associated with CCR are for the closure of a coal ash pond. The Landfill is in compliance with the CCR requirements applicable to CCR landfills and is not required to close. With regards to our coal ash pond, in accordance with federal law and Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 410-20, Environmental Liabilities, we have an environmental liability of $17.5 million as of December 31, 2022. 
During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized a charge of $16.7 million for the remeasurement of environmental liabilities as a result of an update in the cost estimates associated to CCR liabilities related to the Lockwood landfill and the CCR impoundment as part of our continuing evaluation of the site.
