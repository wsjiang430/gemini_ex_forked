Item 1. Business.
Overview
Integrated Wellness Acquisition Corp is a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Island exempted company and formed for the purpose of effecting an initial business combination.
Initial Public Offering
On December 13, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering of 11,500,000 units. Each unit consists of one Class A ordinary share and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company, with each warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share for $11.50 per whole share. The units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $115,000,000.
Simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 6,850,000 warrants to our sponsor at a purchase price of $1.00 per private placement warrant, generating gross proceeds of $6,850,000.
A total of $117,300,000 (equal to $10.20 per unit), comprised of $112,700,000 of the proceeds from our initial public offering and $4,600,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the private placement warrants, was placed in the trust account maintained by Continental, acting as trustee.
It is the job of our sponsor and management team to complete our initial business combination. Our management team is led by Antonio Varano Della Vergiliana, our Chairman, Steven Schapera, our Chief Executive Officer, James MacPherson, our Chief Financial Officer, and Robert Quandt, our Chief Operating Officer, who have many years of experience in the health, nutrition, fitness, wellness and beauty space and have worked together on a number of companies over the past 20 years. We must complete our initial business combination by June 13, 2023, 18 months from the closing of our initial public offering (or up to 21 months from the closing of our initial public offering, or September 13, 2023, if we fully extend the time to complete a business combination as described in this Report). If our initial business combination is not consummated by June 13, 2023 (or by September 13, 2023 if we fully extend the time we have to complete a business combination as described in this Report), then our existence will terminate, and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account.
Refreshing Business Combination
Refreshing Merger Agreement
On February 10, 2023, the Company entered into the Refreshing Merger Agreement with Refreshing, Pubco, Purchaser Merger Sub, Refreshing Merger Sub, our sponsor in the capacity as the Purchaser Representative and Ryan Wear in the capacity as the Seller Representative. Refreshing is a national provider of vending services to education, healthcare, business & industry, sports & leisure and corrections clients. It oversees multiple subsidiaries and businesses across the United States that operate vending assets and services and estimates that it serves hundreds of thousands of customers nationwide.
Pursuant to the Refreshing Merger Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, (i) prior to the Effective Time, the Company will transfer by way of continuation out of the Cayman Islands and into the State of Delaware to re-domicile and become a Delaware corporation, (ii) following the Domestication, Purchaser Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving entity and wholly-owned subsidiary of Pubco, in connection with which all of the existing securities of the Company will be exchanged for rights to receive securities of Pubco as follows: (a) each share of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.0001, outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically convert into one share of Pubco common stock and (b) each whole public warrant and each private placement warrant shall automatically convert into one Pubco warrant on substantially the same terms and conditions; and (iii) Refreshing Merger Sub will merge with and into Refreshing, with Refreshing continuing as the surviving entity and wholly-owned subsidiary of Pubco, pursuant to which all Refreshing Units issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive the applicable portion of the Refreshing Merger Consideration.

Pursuant to the terms of the Refreshing Merger Agreement, the Refreshing Merger Consideration to be delivered to the Sellers in connection with the Refreshing Business Combination will be a number of newly-issued shares of Pubco common stock with an aggregate value equal to $160,000,000, subject to adjustments for Refreshing’s net working capital, closing debt (net of cash) and accrued but unpaid expenses related to the Refreshing Transactions.
At or prior to the Refreshing Closing, Pubco, the Seller Representative, the Purchaser Representative and Continental or such other escrow agent mutually acceptable to the Company and Refreshing will enter into an escrow agreement pursuant to which 15% of the Refreshing Merger Consideration shall be held, along with any other dividends, distributions or other income on such shares (other than regular ordinary dividends), in a segregated escrow account to cover any negative post-closing Refreshing Merger Consideration adjustment and any indemnification claims made against the Sellers under the Refreshing Merger Agreement.
In addition to the shares of Pubco common stock deliverable at the Refreshing Closing, the Sellers will have the contingent right to receive up to an additional 4,000,000 shares of Pubco common stock as earnout consideration after the Refreshing Closing. Such earnout consideration shall be issuable by Pubco to the Sellers (as of the date of the Refreshing Closing) if the following conditions occur: (i) 1,500,000 shares of Pubco common stock upon the achievement of an adjusted EBITDA target of $20 million during the 2023 calendar year, (ii) 1,500,000 additional shares of Pubco common stock upon the achievement of an adjusted EBITDA target of $30.0 million during the 2024 calendar year and (iii) 1,000,000 additional shares of Pubco common stock in the event that the volume weighted average price of the shares of Pubco common stock equals or exceeds $50.00 per share for any twenty (20) out of any thirty (30) consecutive trading days during the five-year period after the Refreshing Closing.
Voting Agreements
Simultaneously with the execution and delivery of the Refreshing Merger Agreement, the Company and Refreshing have entered into the Voting Agreements with certain Sellers required to approve the Refreshing Transactions. Under the Voting Agreements, each Refreshing member party thereto agreed to vote all of such members’ Refreshing Units in favor of the Refreshing Merger Agreement and the related transactions. The Refreshing members also agree to take certain other actions in support of the Refreshing Merger Agreement and related transactions and refrain from taking actions that would adversely affect such Refreshing member’s ability to perform its obligations under the Voting Agreement. Each such Refreshing member also provided a proxy to the Company to vote its Refreshing Units in accordance with the foregoing. The Voting Agreements prevent transfers of the Refreshing interests held by such Refreshing members party thereto between the date of the Voting Agreement and the date of Refreshing Closing, except for certain permitted transfers where the recipient also agrees to comply with the Voting Agreement.
Lock-Up Agreements
Simultaneously with the execution and delivery of the Refreshing Merger Agreement, certain members of Refreshing holding greater than 10% of outstanding Refreshing Units each entered into a Lock-Up Agreement with Pubco and the Purchaser Representative. Pursuant to the Lock-Up Agreements, each Refreshing party thereto agreed not to (A) with respect to Refreshing Merger Consideration received other than the Earnout Shares, during the period commencing from the Refreshing Closing and ending on the earlier of (x) one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of the Refreshing Closing, and (y) the date after the Refreshing Closing on which Pubco consummates a liquidation, merger, capital stock exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction with an unaffiliated third party and (B) with respect to the Earnout Shares, during the period commencing from the date the Earnout Shares are issued to the holder and ending one hundred eighty (180) days after such date: (i) lend, offer, pledge, hypothecate, encumber, donate, assign, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any restricted securities, (ii) enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of such restricted securities, or (iii) publicly disclose the intention to do any of the foregoing, whether any such transaction described in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above is to be settled by delivery of the restricted securities or other securities, in cash or otherwise (in each case, subject to certain limited permitted transfers where the recipient takes the shares subject to the restrictions in the Lock-Up Agreement).
Non-Competition Agreements
Simultaneously with the execution and delivery of the Refreshing Merger Agreement, Ryan Wear, a co-founder of Refreshing, and certain other executive officers of Refreshing (each a “Refreshing Executive”), will each enter into a Non-Competition Agreement in substantially the form attached to the Refreshing Merger Agreement in favor of Pubco, Refreshing and their respective present and 

2



future affiliates, successors and direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively, the “Covered Parties”). Ryan Wear and Jeremy Briggs shall also have non-competition and non-solicitation obligations under their respective employment agreements to be effective as of the consummation of the Refreshing Business Combination. Under each Non-Competition Agreement, for a period of two (2) years after the Refreshing Closing (such period, the “Restricted Period”), the Refreshing Executive party thereto has agreed that he will not and will not permit his or her affiliates to, without Pubco’s’ prior written consent, directly or indirectly engage in the business of providing vending machines, coffee and water services to education, healthcare, business and industry, and sports, leisure and corrections clients. Under each Non-Competition Agreement, the Refreshing Executive party thereto and his affiliates will also be subject to certain non-solicitation and non-interference obligations during the Restricted Period with respect to the Covered Parties’ respective (i) employees, consultants and independent contractors, (ii) customers, and (iii) vendors, suppliers, distributors, agents or other service providers. Each Refreshing Executive will also be subject to non-disparagement provisions regarding the Covered Parties and confidentiality obligations with respect to the confidential information of the Covered Parties.
Other than as specifically discussed, this Report does not assume the closing of the Refreshing Business Combination.
For more information about the Refreshing Business Combination, see the Refreshing Registration Statement and the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 16, 2023.
Our Business
While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any industry or sector, we have focused and will continue to focus on businesses in the health, nutrition, fitness, wellness and beauty sectors and the products, devices, applications and technology driving growth within these verticals. Our management team and board of directors have extensive knowledge and relationships within these markets, and we have capitalized and will continue to capitalize on our ability to identify and acquire businesses that stand to benefit from our unique operational and strategic expertise.
Consumer health, nutrition, fitness, wellness and beauty businesses are supported by strong global growth trends as consumers increasingly commit to living a healthy lifestyle. Consumers are seeking products and services to more effectively monitor, maintain, and improve their health and to achieve a diverse range of objectives, whether nutritional, athletic, fitness or daily wellness related. This evolution has resulted in a large and growing number of compelling business opportunities across the $4.5 trillion global wellness landscape. High growth private companies are taking meaningful market share from prior category leaders, driving an increase in private equity investment and merger and acquisition activity in our targeted sectors. Given the limited number of public companies in our focus verticals, we see a strong opportunity to bring a quality private company to the public.
We believe our team’s deep and extensive relationships across this ecosystem provides us with a competitive advantage in sourcing, evaluating and pursuing a broad range of opportunities in these targeted sectors. While we may pursue any target, we seek strong fundamental businesses with an emphasis on one or more of the following attributes:

● | Strong consumer brand awareness, engagement and affinity;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | Category-leader or disruptor in the highest-growth segments of the industry;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Clear and substantiated impact on consumer health and wellness outcomes;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Tech-enabled or the opportunity to bring technology into the consumer health experience;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Strong growth with further growth opportunities either via geographic, product or channel diversification; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Strong economics or high potential for improvement.
--+----------------------------------------------------

Our Business Strategy
We have more than 150 years of combined business experience in the health, wellness, beauty, finance, entrepreneurship and mergers and acquisitions (“M&A”) spaces, including more than 70 years in wellness and beauty alone. We have an international focus 

3



and believe that our creative, operational and board experience is and will continue to be a major attraction to a company with international ambitions. We have extensive relationships within this sector built over many years which we believe will assist us to identify an attractive business combination target.
Our interest is in a business combination with companies and founders that are looking at the next stage and are attracted to a public listing, such as Refreshing. We believe our track records as founders and managers of successful business and the ability to tap on our resources and grow the business to the next level will make a compelling case for joining our team.
While COVID-19 has accelerated the trends in direct to consumer (“DTC”) and wellness awareness, our management team was an earlier adopter of e-commerce initiatives such as influencer marketing both at Becca Cosmetics and Invincible Brands. We believe that we can facilitate three key growth levers for a potential target: expansion in product and brands, channel expansion with DTC, business to business and retail, and geographical expansion. Our team has vast experience in each of these areas, having built successful products and brands utilizing such growth levers.
We expect that bolt-on acquisitions will be an additional lever to facilitate and drive future growth. We believe that the convergences taking place in the wellness sector will be a catalyst for consolidation, and we expect to be able to further strengthen the business opportunity with well-defined bolt on acquisitions post-merger. We believe our team has the M&A experience and ability to identify the right opportunity and to successfully consummate a bolt-on acquisition.
Our Acquisition Criteria
We have identified the following criteria that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses and ensuring they are aligned with our strategy. We have used and will continue to use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, including the Refreshing Business Combination, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that meets some but not all of these criteria and guidelines. We seek to acquire a company that we believe is:

● | Aligned with growing, recession-resistant target sectors: Operates in the beauty, health, wellness and fitness ecosystem, including in verticals such as sports, digital health, and nutrition, and has an enterprise value of between $250 million and $1 billion.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A recognized and effective brand: Brand that has high consumer awareness, with high engagement and purchase intent pointing to significant room for growth.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A category leader or disruptor with a clear path to get there: Business that is differentiated in its respective category or one where the growth trajectory and industry dynamics suggest category leadership is probable. Key characteristics include demonstrated product efficacy and exceptionally positive product reviews.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | High growth with favorable profitability characteristics: Strong momentum with a clear runway for future growth along with sound unit economics.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Digitally-enabled with scalable technology: Business with a high-quality existing technology stack that supports continued scale and increased penetration that could benefit from investment in technology to further scale the business.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Delivering sustainable consumer outcomes: Products or services that have a clear value proposition and can be proven to drive health, wellness and fitness outcomes. Business will have high social engagement and an authentic relationship with the customer.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Poised to benefit from being a public company: Clear benefits to becoming a public company such as broader access to debt and equity capital, liquidity for employees or key equity holders, or potential to engage in M&A more effectively.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Led by a proven and experienced team: Team that has expertise and track record of achieving scale and one that would succeed in public markets.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4




● | Available at an attractive valuation: Valuation that is appropriate given comparable companies and transactions and that allows for considerable upside for investors.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A platform for growth: Business whose brand and value proposition position it to pursue organic and acquisitive growth across our targeted verticals where we see long-term favorable trends and a sizable number of opportunities as complementary add-ons.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Upside opportunities: Business that can grow through product line extensions, geographic expansion and/or new channels.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management team may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that meets some but not all of the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business meets some but not all of the above criteria in our shareholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in this Report, would be in the form of proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, that we would file with the SEC. In evaluating a prospective target business, such as Refreshing, we conduct a due diligence review which encompasses, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspections of facilities, as well as reviewing financial and other information which will be made available to us.
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, directors or officers, or making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, directors or officers. While Refreshing is not affiliated with our sponsor, directors or officers, in the event we do not consummate the Refreshing Business Combination and we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with any of our sponsor, directors or officers, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that such initial business combination is fair to our Company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.
Each of our sponsor, directors, and officers directly or indirectly own founder shares and/or private placement warrants and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, such officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.
Past experience or performance of our sponsor, directors or management team or their respective affiliates, including performance information of funds with which they are or were associated, is not a guarantee of either (1) our ability to successfully identify and execute a transaction or (2) success with respect to any business combination that we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of our sponsor, directors or management team or their respective affiliates as indicative of future performance. Our management has no prior experience in operating blank check companies or SPACs.
Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity subject to his or her fiduciary duties under applicable law. As a result, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under applicable law, he or she may need to honor such fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity before we can pursue such opportunity. If these other entities decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing the same. However, we do not expect these duties to materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law: (i) no individual serving as a director or an officer shall have any duty, except and to the extent expressly assumed by contract, to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us; and (ii) we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for any director or officer on the one hand, and us, on the other.
Our officers and directors and any of their respective affiliates may sponsor or form, or, in the case of individuals, serve as a director, officer or advisor of, other blank check companies similar to ours during the period in which we are seeking an initial business 

5



combination. Any such companies may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an acquisition target. However, we do not believe that any such potential conflicts would materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination.
Our Acquisition Process
In evaluating a prospective target business, such as Refreshing, we conduct a thorough due diligence review that encompasses, among other things, meetings with current management and employees, document reviews, consumer research, as well as a review of financial, legal, tax, and other information that is made available to us. We also utilize our operational experience to validate opportunities for strategic growth.
Members of our management team and our independent directors directly or indirectly own founder shares and/or private placement warrants and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.
Management Team Considerations
Over the last twenty years our management team has developed an extensive list of contacts and relationships with founders, major companies, industry executives, private equity funds and investment bankers. These relationships span the globe since the team has been operating internationally for many years. Our team believes that its global reach gives us a competitive advantage in identifying a profitable growth company in the health, wellness and beauty sectors that may be attracted by the team’s level of experience in growing and successfully managing geographical, channel or product expansions. The team believes that the combined company will create a much stronger entity, with bolt-on acquisitions as a key growth lever going forward.
Initial Business Combination
So long as our securities are then listed on the NYSE, our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of a target business or businesses, it may be unable to do so if the board is less familiar or experienced with the target company’s business, there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the company’s assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the board determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. Since any opinion, if obtained, would merely state that the fair market value of the target business meets the 80% of net assets threshold, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of a target business or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed to our shareholders. However, if required under applicable law, any proxy statement that we deliver to shareholders and file with the SEC in connection with a proposed transaction will include such opinion.
We have filed a registration statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of suspending or terminating our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination.
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-business combination company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-business combination company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the issued and outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not 

6



to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding share capital of a target or issue a substantial number of new shares to third-parties in connection with financing our initial business combination. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-business combination company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. If our securities are not then listed on the NYSE for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% of net asset test. Based on the valuation analysis of our management and board of directors, we have determined that the fair market value of Refreshing was substantially in excess of 80% of the funds in the trust account and that the 80% test was therefore satisfied.
To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.
In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our sponsor.
Status as a Public Company
We believe our structure as a public company makes us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business, such as Refreshing, an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination with us. In a business combination transaction with us, the owners of the target business may, for example, exchange their shares of stock in the target business for our Class A ordinary shares (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of our Class A ordinary shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. See “Refreshing Business Combination” above regarding such exchange in the Refreshing Business Combination. We believe target businesses will find this method a more expeditious and cost-effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. The typical initial public offering process takes a significantly longer period of time than the typical business combination transaction process, and there are significant expenses in the initial public offering process, including underwriting discounts and commissions, that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.
Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, such as the Refreshing Business Combination, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or have negative valuation consequences. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital, an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders’ interests and the ability to use its shares as currency for acquisitions and other strategic transactions. Being a public company can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.
While we believe that our structure and our management team’s backgrounds will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view our status as a blank check company, such as our lack of an operating history and our ability to seek shareholder approval of any proposed initial business combination, negatively.
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies 

7



that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved, If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) (a) December 31, 2026, (b) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion, or (c) the last day of the fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $250 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, or (2) our annual revenues equals or exceeds $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter.
Financial Position
With funds available for a business combination in the amount of approximately $115,404,246 as of December 31, 2022, after payment of $4,025,000 of deferred underwriting fees but including the $436,972 of offering proceeds held outside the trust account as of December 31, 2022, we offer a target business, such as Refreshing, a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, there can be no assurance third-party financing will be available to us.
Effecting Our Initial Business Combination
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations until we consummate our initial business combination. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of the private placement warrants, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination (pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into following the consummation of our initial public offering or otherwise), shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to banks or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing or other sources. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.
If our initial business combination is funded using equity consideration or the proceeds of any equity or debt financing, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A ordinary shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-business combination company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

Although our management seeks to assess the risks inherent in target businesses with which we may combine, we cannot assure you that this assessment will result in our identifying all risks that a target business may encounter. Furthermore, some of those risks may be outside of our control, meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely affect a target business.
We may need to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination, either because the transaction requires more cash than is available from the proceeds held in our trust account, or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of the business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. There are no prohibitions on our ability to issue securities or incur debt in connection with our initial business combination. We are not currently a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities, the incurrence of debt or otherwise.

Sources of Target Businesses
Target business candidates are brought to our attention from various affiliated and unaffiliated sources, including, investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises. Target businesses are brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since some of these sources will have read our prospectus in connection with our initial public offering or this Report and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates and other affiliated sources may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors. We may engage the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finder’s fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. In no event, however, will our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or their respective affiliates be paid by us any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). We have agreed to pay our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, secretarial and administrative support and reimburse our sponsor for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating and completing an initial business combination. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-business combination company following our initial business combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an acquisition candidate.
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we do not consummate the Refreshing Business Combination and we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor or any of our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that such initial business combination is fair to our Company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.
Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have, additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities, including and other entities that are affiliates of our sponsor, pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. In addition, the fiduciary duties and contractual obligations that our officers and directors may have to other entities, including confidentiality obligations that may restrict their ability to share with us or 

9



utilize on our behalf information they learn that could be beneficial to us, may otherwise adversely affect our ability to identify or pursue certain business combination opportunities. At this time, none of our officers or directors have any such confidentiality obligations but they may have them in the future.
In recent years, the number of SPACs that have been formed has increased substantially. Many potential targets for SPACs have already entered into an initial business combination, and, as of the date of this Report, there are many SPACs seeking targets for their initial business combination. As a result, at times, we expect there to be greater competition for available targets, more time, more effort and more resources may be necessary to identify a suitable target, and consummating an initial business combination may be more expensive.
Evaluation of a Target Business and Structuring of Our Initial Business Combination
In evaluating a prospective target business, such as Refreshing, we conduct an extensive due diligence review which encompasses, as applicable and among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities and a review of financial and other information about the target and its industry. We also utilize our management team’s operational and capital planning experience. If we determine to move forward with a particular target, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the business combination transaction.
Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. We will not pay any consulting fees to members of our management team, or their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our initial business combination. In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our sponsor.
Lack of Business Diversification
For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industries in which we operate after our initial business combination; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team
Although we closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business, including the management of Refreshing, when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business and plan to continue doing so if the Refreshing Business Combination is not consummated and we seek other business combination opportunities, our assessment of the target business’s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination, including the Refreshing Business Combination in which Antonio Varano Della Vergiliana and Gael Forterre will join the board for the combined company, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.

10



We cannot assure you that any of our officers, except as disclosed above will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.
Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination
We may conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC and subject to the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. However, we will seek shareholder approval if it is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement (as is the case in the Refreshing Business Combination), or we may decide to seek shareholder approval for business or other reasons.
Under the NYSE’s listing rules, shareholder approval would typically be required for our initial business combination if, for example:

● | We issue ordinary shares that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of our ordinary shares then-outstanding (other than in a public offering);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Any of our directors, officers or substantial stockholders (as defined by the NYSE rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of shares of our ordinary shares could result in an increase in outstanding ordinary shares or voting power of 5% or more; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The issuance or potential issuance of ordinary shares will result in our undergoing a change of control.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination in those instances in which shareholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange rule will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on business and reasons, which include a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:

● | the timing of the transaction, including in the event we determine shareholder approval would require additional time and there is either not enough time to seek shareholder approval or doing so would place the Company at a disadvantage in the transaction or result in other additional burdens on the Company;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the expected cost of holding a shareholder vote;
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | the risk that the shareholders would fail to approve the proposed business combination;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | other time and budget constraints of the Company; and
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | additional legal complexities of a proposed business combination that would be time-consuming and burdensome to present to shareholders.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See “Refreshing Business Combination” above for more information regarding the requisite approvals
needed in the Refreshing Business Combination.
Permitted Purchases and Other Transactions with Respect to Our Securities
If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, executive officers or their affiliates may purchase 

11



public shares or warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. Additionally, at any time at or prior to our initial business combination, subject to applicable securities laws (including with respect to material nonpublic information), our sponsor, directors, executive officers or their affiliates may enter into transactions with investors and others to provide them with incentives to acquire public shares, vote their public shares in favor of our initial business combination or not redeem their public shares. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase public shares or warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will be restricted from making any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act.
In the event that our sponsor, directors, officers or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights or submitted a proxy to vote against our initial business combination, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares and any proxy to vote against our initial business combination. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will be required to comply with such rules.
The purpose of any such transaction could be to (i) vote in favor of our initial business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination, (ii) reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination or (iii) satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.
In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our Class A ordinary shares or public warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.
Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the shareholders with whom our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated transactions by either the shareholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by shareholders (in the case of Class A ordinary shares) following our mailing of tender offer or proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates enter into a private transaction, they would identify and contact only potential selling or redeeming shareholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against our initial business combination, whether or not such shareholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to our initial business combination but only if such shares have not already been voted at the general meeting related to our initial business combination. Our sponsor, executive officers, directors or their affiliates will select which shareholders to purchase shares from based on the negotiated price and number of shares and any other factors that they may deem relevant, and will be restricted from purchasing shares if such purchases do not comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws.
Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will be restricted from making purchases of shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5of the Exchange Act. We expect any such purchases would be reported by such person pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements.
Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, such as the Refreshing Business Combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any, divided by the number of then-outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. As of December 31, 2022, the amount in the trust account was approximately $10.35 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the 

12



underwriters. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business combination with respect to our warrants. Further, we will not proceed with redeeming our public shares, even if a public shareholder has properly elected to redeem its shares, if a business combination does not close. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that only public shares and not any founder shares are entitled to redemption rights. In addition, our sponsor and each member of our management team have entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares held by them in connection with (i) the completion of our initial business combination and (ii) a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by June 13, 2023 (or by September 13, 2023, 21 months from the closing of our initial public offering, if we fully extend the time to complete a business combination as described in this Report) or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares.
Limitations on Redemptions
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). However, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceeds the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.
Manner of Conducting Redemptions
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a general meeting called to approve the business combination, such as in the Refreshing Business Combination, or (ii) by means of a tender offer. Except as required by applicable law or stock exchange rules, the decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or whether we were deemed to be a foreign private issuer (which would require a tender offer rather than seeking shareholder approval under SEC rules). Asset acquisitions and share purchases would not typically require shareholder approval while direct mergers with our Company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares or seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association would typically require shareholder approval. We intend to conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless shareholder approval is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or we choose to seek shareholder approval for business or other reasons. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on the NYSE, we will be required to comply with the NYSE rules.
If we held a shareholder vote to approve our initial business combination, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association:

● | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

In the event that we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.

13



If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will complete our initial business combination only if we obtain the approval of an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the Company (unless a greater vote is required by applicable law or stock exchange rules). In such case, our sponsor and each member of our management team have agreed to vote their founder shares and public shares in favor of our initial business combination. As a result, in addition to our initial shareholders’ founder shares, we would need 4,312,501, or 37.5%, of the 11,500,000 public shares sold in our initial public offering to be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order to have our initial business combination approved (unless a greater vote is required by applicable law or stock exchange rules). Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or vote at all. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that only public shares and not any founder shares are entitled to redemption rights. In addition, our sponsor and each member of our management team have entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares held by them in connection with (i) the completion of our initial business combination and (ii) a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by June 13, 2023 (or by September 13, 2023 if we fully extend the time to complete a business combination as described in this Report) or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares.
If we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association:

● | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Upon the public announcement of our initial business combination, if we elect to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, we and our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase Class A ordinary shares in the open market, in order to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.
In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a)under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public shareholders not tendering more than the number of public shares we are permitted to redeem. If public shareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete such initial business combination.
See “Refreshing Business Combination” above for more information regarding the requisite approvals needed for the Refreshing Business Combination.
Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination If We Seek Shareholder Approval
If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering, which we refer to as “Excess Shares,” without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us, our sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By imposing such limitations on our shareholders’ ability to redeem no more 

14



than 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering without our prior consent, as described above, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash.
However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.
See “Refreshing Business Combination” above for more information regarding the requisite approvals needed for the Refreshing Business Combination.
Tendering Share Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights
Public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” will be required to either tender their certificates (if any) to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, mailed to such holders, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using the DWAC System, at the holder’s option, in each case up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote to approve the business combination. The proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate the applicable delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Accordingly, a public shareholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short period in which to exercise redemption rights, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.
There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a nominal fee and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.
In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the shareholders’ vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such shareholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the shareholder then had an “option window” after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company’s shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which shareholders were aware they needed to commit before the general meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming shareholders’ election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.
Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination, unless otherwise agreed to by us. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination.
If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.

If the Refreshing Business Combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until June 13, 2023 (or September 13, 2023 if we fully extend the time to complete a business combination as described in this Report).
Extension of Time to Complete Business Combination
We originally had 15 months from the consummation of our initial public offering, or until March 13, 2023, to consummate our initial business combination. However, as requested by our sponsor and as permitted under our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and the trust agreement entered into between us and Continental, in March 2023 we extended the date by which we must consummate an initial business combination by an additional three months until June 13, 2023, or a total of 18 months from the consummation of our initial public offering. In order for the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination to be extended, our sponsor deposited into the trust account $1,150,000 (or $0.10 per unit). In connection with the deposit, we issued to our sponsor a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note in the principal amount of $1,150,000. Such note is payable by us in cash upon the earlier of the consummation of the initial business combination or our liquidation. Such extension was the first of two automatic extensions permitted under our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association.
If we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination within 18 months of our initial public offering (by June 13, 2023), our sponsor or its affiliates or designees may, but are not obligated to, cause our Company to further extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination by an additional three months (for a total of 21 months to complete a business combination, or until September 13, 2023). In order to further extend the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination pursuant to this provision, our sponsor or its affiliates or designees, upon five days advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, must deposit into the trust account for such three-month extension an additional $1,150,000 ($0.10 per unit) on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline. Our sponsor or its affiliates or designees will receive a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note equal to the amount of any such additional deposit that will not be repaid in the event that we are unable to close our initial business combination unless there are funds available outside the trust account to do so. Such notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, or, at the lender’s discretion, converted upon consummation of our business combination into additional warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant. In the event that we receive notice from our sponsor or its affiliates or designees five days prior to the applicable deadline of its intent to effect the second extension, we intend to issue a press release announcing such intention at least three days prior to the applicable deadline. In addition, we intend to issue a press release the day after the applicable deadline announcing whether or not the funds had been timely deposited. Our sponsor or its affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the trust account to further extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination. To the extent that some, but not all, of the members of our sponsor or its affiliates or designees decide to further extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination, our sponsor or its affiliates or designees may elect to deposit the entire amount required. Any notes issued pursuant to these loans would be in addition to any notes issued pursuant to working capital loans made to us.
Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation If No Initial Business Combination
Under our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, we have only 18 months from the closing of our initial public offering, or until June 13, 2023 (or up to 21 months from the closing of our initial public offering, or until September 13, 2023, if we fully extend the time to complete a business combination as described in this Report), to consummate an initial business combination. If we have not consummated the Refreshing Business Combination or another initial business combination by June 13, 2023 (or by September 13, 2023 if we fully extend the time to complete a business combination as described in this Report), we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to consummate an initial business combination by June 13, 2023 (or by September 13, 2023 if we fully extend the time to complete a business combination as described in this Report). Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, if we wind up for any other reason prior to the consummation of our initial business 

16



combination, we will follow the foregoing procedures with respect to the liquidation of the trust account as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, subject to applicable Cayman Islands law.
Our sponsor and each member of our management team have entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares they hold if we fail to consummate an initial business combination by June 13, 2023 (or by September 13, 2023 if we fully extend the time to complete a business combination as described in this Report) (although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any public shares they hold if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame).
Our sponsor, executive officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by June 13, 2023 (or by September 13, 2023 if we fully extend the time to complete a business combination as described in this Report) or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any, divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement, we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our sponsor, any executive officer, director, director nominee or any other person.
If we do not consummate the Refreshing Business Combination or another initial business combination by the deadline set forth in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, we expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the $436,972 held outside the trust account as of December 31, 2022, plus up to $100,000 of funds from the trust account available to us to pay dissolution expenses, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose.
If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, based on the amount in the trust account as of December 31, 2022 the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.35 (before taking into account the withdrawal of interest to pay taxes, if any, and of up to $100,000 to pay dissolution expenses). The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders will not be less than $10.35. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.
Although we seek to have all vendors, service providers (except our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including, but not limited, to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third-party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third-party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third-party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third-party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. The representative of the underwriters will not execute an agreement with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust 

17



account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third-party for services rendered or products sold to us (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) $10.20 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.20 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay our tax obligations, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third-party or prospective target business that executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the representative of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third-party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. We believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our Company and, therefore, we believe it is unlikely that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, and therefore, no funds are currently set aside to cover any such obligations. None of our other officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.
In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.20 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.20 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay our tax obligations, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.20 per public share.
We have sought and will continue to seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors. However, such liability will not be greater than the amount of funds from our trust account received by any such shareholder. As of December 31, 2022, the amount held outside the trust account was $436,972.
If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.35 per public share to our public shareholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer,” a “fraudulent conveyance” or a “voidable transfer.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty and/or may have acted in bad faith by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors, thereby exposing itself and us to claims seeking damages, including potential punitive damages. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.
Our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by June 13, 2023 (or by September 13, 2023 if we fully extend the time to complete a business combination as described in this Report), (ii) in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by June 13, 2023 (or by September 13, 2023 if we fully extend the time to complete a business combination as described in this Report) or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares, or (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the initial 

18



business combination. Public shareholders who redeem their Class A ordinary shares in connection with a shareholder vote described in clause (ii) in the preceding sentence shall not be entitled to funds from the trust account upon the subsequent completion of an initial business combination or liquidation if we have not consummated an initial business combination by June 13, 2023 (or by September 13, 2023 if we fully extend the time to complete a business combination as described in this Report), with respect to such Class A ordinary shares so redeemed. In no other circumstances will a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a shareholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a shareholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, like all provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, may be amended with a shareholder vote.
Competition
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, such as Refreshing, we are encountering intense and increasing competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies, operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses is limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Human Capital
We currently have three executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they devote in any time period varies based on the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
Our units, Class A ordinary shares, and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act, and as a result, we have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports, including this Report, contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, sent to shareholders. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, GAAP or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with the requirements outlined above, or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.
We are required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the year ending December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we not be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 

19



regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
We have filed a registration statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of suspending or terminating our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination.
We are a Cayman Islands exempted company. Exempted companies are Cayman Islands companies conducting business mainly outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted from complying with certain provisions of the Companies Act. As an exempted company, we have applied for and received a tax exemption undertaking from the Cayman Islands government that, in accordance with Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Act (Revised) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 20 years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations will apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax will be payable (i) on or in respect of our shares, debentures or other obligations or (ii) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by us to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due under a debenture or other obligation of us.
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) (a) December 31, 2026, (b) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion, or (c) the last day of the fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds$700 million as of the prior June 30.
