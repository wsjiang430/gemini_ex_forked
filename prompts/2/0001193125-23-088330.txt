ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Introduction 
 We are a blank check company incorporated on March 9, 2021 as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a “shell company” as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash. 
 On September 28, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering (“Public Offering”) of 23,000,000 units, including the issuance of 3,000,000 units as a result of the underwriters’ full exercise of their over-allotment option. Each unit consists of one share of Class A common stock and one-half of one redeemable warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share. The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds, before expenses, of $230,000,000. 
 On June 7, 2021, our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 5,750,000 founder shares (“Founder Shares”) for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.004 per share. The number of Founder Shares outstanding was determined based on the Company’s expectation that the total size of the Public Offering would be a maximum of 23,000,000 units if the underwriters’ over-allotment option was exercised in full, and therefore that such Founder Shares would represent 20% of the outstanding shares after the Public Offering. Prior to our sponsor’s initial investment of $25,000, the Company had no assets, tangible or intangible. 
 Simultaneously with the closing of the Public Offering, pursuant to the Private Placement Warrants Purchase Agreement, the Company completed the private sale of an aggregate of 11,700,000 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) to the sponsor at a purchase price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $11,700,000, a portion of which was added to the proceeds from the Public Offering held in the Trust Account (as defined below). No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect to such sale. The issuance of the Private Placement Warrants was made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). 
 The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Warrants sold in the Public Offering, except that the Private Placement Warrants, so long as they are held by our sponsor or its permitted transferees, (i) are not redeemable by the us, (ii) may not (including the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of such Private Placement Warrants), subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by such holders until 30 days after the completion of the Company’s initial business combination, (iii) may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis and (iv) are entitled to registration rights. If the Private Placement Warrants are held by holders other than our sponsor or its permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by us. If the Company does not consummate its initial business combination by the Termination Date, the Private Placement Warrants will expire worthless. 
 Upon the closing of the Public Offering and the Private Placement, $234,600,000 was placed in a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee (the “Trust Account”). We are not 
 
4 


  permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held in the Trust Account, except for the withdrawal of interest to pay our taxes and up to $100,000 of interests to pay dissolution expenses, as applicable, if any, until the earliest of (i) the completion of our initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination by the Termination Date, subject to applicable law, and (iii) the redemption of our public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (“Charter”) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated our initial business combination by the Termination Date or with respect to any other material provisions relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity. The proceeds held in the Trust Account may only be invested in United States “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. 
 After the payment of underwriting discounts and commissions (excluding the deferred portion of $8,050,000 in underwriting discounts and commissions payable upon consummation of our initial business combination if consummated) and approximately $490,543 in expenses relating to the Public Offering, approximately $1,537,621 of the net proceeds of the Public Offering and Private Placement was not deposited into the Trust Account and was initially available to us for working capital purposes. The net proceeds deposited into the Trust Account remain on deposit in the Trust Account earning interest. As of March 21, 2022, there was approximately $324,624,819 in investments and cash held in the Trust Account. 
 On March 17, 2023, we announced that we entered into a non-binding letter of intent (“LOI”) for a potential business combination with a private company in the urban mobility sector. No assurances can be made that we will successfully negotiate and enter into a definitive agreement for a business combination or that we will be successful in completing the business combination. 
 On March 24, 2023, we held a special meeting of stockholders (the “Extension Meeting”) to, in part, amend our amended and restated certificate of association to extend the date by which we have to consummate a business combination (the “Termination Date”) from March 28, 2023 (the “Original Termination Date”) to June 28, 2023 (the “Charter Extension Date”) and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date to consummate a Business Combination on a monthly basis up to nine times by an additional one month each time after the Charter Extension Date, by resolution of our board of directors (the “Board”), if requested by the Sponsor, and upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until March 28, 2024 (each, an “Additional Charter Extension Date”) or a total of up to twelve months after the Original Termination Date, unless the closing of a business combination shall have occurred prior thereto (the “Extension Amendment Proposal”). For each monthly extension of the Charter Extension Date we will deposit $160,000 into the Trust Account. In connection with that vote, the holders of 17,404,506 Class A common stock of the Company properly exercised their right to redeem their shares for an aggregate price of approximately $10.48 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $182,460,110. After the satisfaction of such redemptions, the balance in our trust account was approximately $58,660,352 (including interest not previously released to the Company but net of expected franchise and income taxes payable). 
 Effecting Our Initial Business Combination 
 General 
 We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time following the Public Offering. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the Public Offering and the private placement of the Private Placement Warrants, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination, shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing.

 Business Strategy 
 We intend to identify and effect a business combination with a company, or companies, within the direct selling industry that we believe can benefit from the vast experience and expertise of our management team, as well as the access to capital markets our vehicle can provide. We are positioning ourselves as a powerful partner to industry companies, ownership groups and management teams based on our ability to provide growth capital and liquidity in an environment where it can otherwise prove challenging. 
Our Access to Industry Companies is Unique and Differentiating 
 Our target evaluation and selection process will rely on the incomparable network and relationships of our management, board of directors and sponsor teams. Through their various business endeavors and extended service to the direct selling industry, we believe our team is the most connected group in the direct selling industry worldwide. Due to the nature and extent of these relationships, our team is already intimately familiar with the business, financials and prospects of many companies within our target universe. This allows us to quickly engage with potential targets and we expect the evaluation process to move quickly in each case 
The Direct Selling Industry is Traditionally Underserved by Capital Markets 
 The direct selling industry has been traditionally underserved by the capital markets for a variety of reasons. Most direct selling companies are self-funded by their founders, or by a close network of industry investors. The nature of the business allows these companies to grow profitably and scale out of cash flow. This ability diminishes the need for these companies to develop relationships with the financial community through much of their early existence. Consequently, there exists an information gap and a lack of understanding between many industry companies and the various financial constituencies. As a result, liquidity and growth capital opportunities are not as readily available to many direct selling companies as they would be to similarly-situated companies in other industries. We believe that our expertise, reputation, and relationships will ideally position us to bridge this gap. 
Our Team will be the Industry’s Preferred Partner 
 The members of our management team, board of directors and extended sponsor team are well-known and highly-respected across the direct selling industry. Industry ownership groups and C-suite executives know us, our reputations and abilities and know that we understand their businesses and customers. As a result, we believe that we will be seen as the preferred sponsorship group by industry companies as compared to competing groups. 
We Believe We Will Experience Little Competition for Target Companies 
 We believe that our relationships within, and knowledge of, the direct selling industry will provide us access to proprietary and first-look deal flow not available to other potential acquirors and/or special purpose acquisition companies. As previously mentioned, we believe that a disconnect exists between direct selling companies and the capital markets. The majority of direct selling companies are family-owned, or closely held, entities that may not typically consider the public markets without the guidance of a team such as ours. 
Market Inefficiencies Exist Between Private and Public Direct Selling Company Valuations 
 Due to the disconnect and lack of understanding between the capital markets and the direct selling industry, there is a lack of a consistent, competitive bid for many private industry participants. Private equity firms are hesitant to take minority positions in companies they do not fully understand, and, likewise, industry participants are hesitant to sell a control stake in their business to firms that do not understand how to operate them. Conversely, the publicly traded comparable companies within the industry have performed exceptionally well over the years. We believe that the lack of a competitive bid and/or similarly beneficial alternatives will allow us to effect our business combination at a desirable valuation.

 The Companies Within Our Target Universe Possess Significant Growth Opportunities 
 While each company within our target universe possesses significant scale and is highly profitable, we believe that each has significant growth opportunities inherent to its business in one, or more, of the below categories. Due to the closely held ownership structure of many of these companies and their history of sustaining themselves on organic cashflow, often, despite their significant profitability, investments in growth opportunities are forgone to instead fund cash distributions to ownership. As such, we believe an infusion of growth capital in one or more of the following areas can have an immediate and substantial impact within the majority of our possible target companies. 

• | International Expansion: The United States is the largest direct selling market in the world. However, there also are significant opportunities around the world. A properly executed international expansion program can be capital-intensive, but also provides a relatively quick return on investment.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Technology Utilization: Technology, and in particular mobile technology, continues to shift the way we work, shop, communicate and play on a daily basis. The playing field is ever-evolving and shifting providing all businesses and industries the opportunity to either grow or be left behind. Within the direct selling industry, as with many others, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adaption to, and implementation of, a wide variety of technologies. As a historically face-to-face business, many direct selling companies have otherwise been slow to adapt to some of the new technologies; however, the transition has proved to be remarkably effective. We believe the direct selling industry is evolving from a “work from home” model to a “work from phone” model, allowing industry sales forces to work and run their businesses from anywhere, anytime. As such, we believe that seamless mobile applications and features such as mobile sampling platforms are critical to the future success of industry participants. Our team has extensive experience in these areas and the ability to assist and guide target companies in each of the relevant aspects, including branding, social marketing and selling, as well as mobile applications that provide a seamless distributor and customer experience.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Product Line Expansion: The independent sales forces and customer bases of direct selling companies represent a captive, engaged audience numbering, in the case of the majority of our target universe, in the hundreds of thousands, if not millions. These companies serve as a compelling platform for the introduction of new products and new product categories to that captive audience. We believe a significant opportunity exists to introduce new products to the existing channel through the acquisition of existing direct to consumer (“DTC”) brands and/or proprietary intellectual property. Our team also possesses the expertise, know-how and relationships to expand a target’s current offerings through the development of additional products and/or product categories to supplement the target’s current offerings.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Data: Our team possesses knowledge, expertise and experience in certain forms of data analysis utilizing data points and indicators that are specific to the direct selling industry and that we believe to be unique. These methods of analysis will be utilized in our target evaluation process and will assist in the identification of both positive and negative trends within a target company’s business. Additionally, we believe that these methods of analysis will be highly beneficial post-business combination in identifying opportunities to accelerate growth.

Sourcing and Evaluation of Business Combination Targets 
 Based on the extensive experience of our team, and our intimate knowledge of the direct selling space, we have developed a comprehensive list of criteria to guide us in the evaluation of potential target companies. Our team possesses the core competencies to understand and properly evaluate the key business drivers underlying direct selling businesses, as well as assess potential growth opportunities inherent to each individual business. We also possess proprietary tools and databases that, when combined with our experience and relationships, allow us to evaluate industry companies at a level and in a manner that we believe has never before been available. Below is a listing of some of the criteria our team will be focused on in the evaluation of potential targets. 
 
7 


 
1.) | Minimum five-year operating history: We seek target companies that have established themselves as long-term growth companies. These companies possess proven staying power and distributor and customer loyalty.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2.) | Diversified, differentiated and consumable product offerings: We seek target companies with diversified and proprietary product offerings. The majority of our target companies offer products in the health and wellness, nutrition, weight loss, skin care, personal care and beauty categories, where supplies must be replenished on a regular basis.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3.) | Product-driven and customer-focused: We will target companies that are product-driven and customer-focused, as opposed to opportunity-driven and focused. We seek companies offering competitively priced products, with a clear value proposition and a high customer to distributor ratio.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4.) | Scale and profitability: We are targeting companies with the scale and profitability necessary to perform at a high level in the public markets, which we define as having a minimum of $300 million in trailing twelve month (“TTM”) revenue and a minimum of $50 million in TTM EBITDA.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5.) | Digital focus and/or opportunity: We seek companies with the either proven or evident ability to grow their business virtually, effective social selling tools or strategies or the clear path to their development and virtually demonstrable products.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6.) | Clear expansion and growth opportunities: Target companies should present a clear path to growth in one or more of three key areas, including international expansion, product line expansion or through the utilization of additional technologies.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


7.) | Desirable demographics: We seek companies with a desirable demographic profile, or the clear ability to attract desirable demographics, including those in the 25-45 age bracket with a high millennial concentration.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


8.) | Complementary to the skill set and abilities of our team: We seek target companies where we believe the skills, experience and relationships of our team can provide synergistic value.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


9.) | Attractive valuation: Targets should be valued attractively relative to their existing financial metrics and potential for operational improvement and offer an attractive potential return for our stockholders.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These criteria and guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general criteria and guidelines as well as other considerations, factors, guidelines and criteria that our leadership team may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into a business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria and guidelines in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which would be in the form of proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, that we would file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspections of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us. We will also utilize our operational and capital planning experience. 
 We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers, directors or advisors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”), or from an independent accounting firm, that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. 
 Members of our management team and sponsor group may directly or indirectly own our common stock and/or Private Placement Warrants, and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a 
 
8 


  particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors is included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. 
 Although our officers and directors are from time to time made aware of potential business opportunities, one or more of which we may desire to pursue for a business combination, we have not (nor has anyone on our behalf) contacted any prospective target business or had any discussions, formal or otherwise, with any business combination target. Additionally, we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, taken any measure, directly or indirectly, to identify or locate any suitable acquisition candidate for us, nor have we engaged or retained any agent or other representative to identify or locate any such acquisition candidate. 
 A number of our officers and directors presently have, and any of them in the future may have, additional fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Delaware law. We expect that if an opportunity is presented to one of our officers or directors in his or her capacity as an officer or director of one of those other entities, such opportunity would be presented to such other entity and not to us. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. 
 We may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our initial business combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of our initial business combination. We intend to effect a business combination with a company with an enterprise value significantly above the net proceeds of the Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants. Depending on the size of the transaction or the number of public shares we become obligated to redeem, we may potentially utilize several additional financing sources, including but not limited to the issuance of additional securities to the sellers of a target business, debt issued by banks or other lenders or the owners of the target, a private placement to raise additional funds, or a combination of the foregoing. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the Trust Account. In addition, following our initial business combination, if cash on hand is insufficient to meet our obligations or our working capital needs, we may need to obtain additional financing. 
 Initial Business Combination 
 Our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the net assets held in the Trust Account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting commissions held in trust) at the time of signing the agreement to enter into the initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses or we are considering an initial business combination with an affiliated entity, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent valuation or accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. 
 We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the 
 
9 


  outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity securities of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of the 80% of net assets test described above. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. 
 We have filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we will be subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination. 
 Redemption Rights for Holders of Public Shares Upon Consummation of Our Initial Business Combination 
 We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and less up to $100,000 to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business combination with respect to our warrants. Our initial stockholders, sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and any public shares that they hold in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. 
 If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our Charter: (a) conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E under the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and (b) file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. 
Resources and Competition 
 Our Charter provides that we will have only until the Termination Date to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination by the Termination Date, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and less up to $100,000 to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any) and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following 
 
10 


  such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject, in each case, to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. 
 In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other special purpose acquisition companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Additionally, the number of special purpose acquisition companies looking for business combination targets has increased compared to recent years and many of these special purpose acquisition companies are sponsored by entities or persons that have significant experience with completing business combinations. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination. 
 Facilities 
 We currently utilize office space at 5800 Democracy Drive, Plano, Texas 75024 from our sponsor and the members of our management team. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations. 
Employees 
 We currently have three executive officers: Dave Wentz, Mike Lohner and Wayne Moorehead. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. 
Available Information 
 We are required to file Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form10-Q with the SEC on a regular basis, and are required to disclose certain material events (e.g., changes in corporate control, acquisitions or dispositions of a significant amount of assets other than in the ordinary course of business and bankruptcy) in a Current Report on Form 8-K. The SEC maintains an Internet website that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. The SEC’s internet website is located at http://www.sec.gov. In addition, the Company will provide copies of these documents without charge upon request from us in writing at 5800 Democracy Drive, Plano, Texas 75024 or by telephone at (214)380-6020.
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and 
 
11 


  stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the Public Offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act. 
 Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates is equal to or exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30th and (2) our annual revenues were equal to or exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates is equal to or exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th. 
 DSAC’s sponsor is DSAC Partners LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. Our sponsor currently owns 5,750,000 shares of Common Stock and 11,700,000 private placement warrants of DSAC. DSAC Manager LLC is the manager of our sponsor. Dave Wentz is the sole member of DSAC Manager LLC and has voting and investment discretion with the Common Stock held of record by our sponsor. Mr. Wentz disclaims any beneficial ownership of the shares held by our sponsor, except to the extent of his pecuniary interest therein . In December 2022, an affiliate of Antara Capital LP (“Antara”) acquired a majority economic, non-voting interest in our sponsor. Antara was founded by Himanshu Gulati in 2018 and invests across a wide variety of financial instruments, including loans, bonds, convertible bonds, stressed/distressed credit and special situation equity investments. 
 Our sponsor would likely to be considered by Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”) to be “controlled” (as defined in 31 CFR 800.208) by a foreign person, such that our sponsor’s involvement in our initial business combination would likely be a “covered transaction” (as defined in 31 CFR800.213). In addition, it is possible that non-U.S. persons could be involved in our initial business combination, which may increase the risk that our initial business combination becomes subject to regulatory review, including review by the CFIUS, and that restrictions, limitations or conditions will be imposed by CFIUS. If our initial business combination with a U.S. business is subject to CFIUS review, the scope of which was expanded by the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 (“FIRRMA”), to include certain non-passive, non-controlling investments in sensitive U.S. businesses and certain acquisitions of real estate even with no underlying U.S. business. FIRRMA, and subsequent implementing regulations that are now in force, also subjects certain categories of investments to mandatory filings. If our initial business combination with a U.S. business falls within CFIUS’s jurisdiction, we may determine that we are required to make a mandatory filing or that we will submit a voluntary notice to CFIUS, or to proceed with an initial business combination without notifying CFIUS and risk CFIUS intervention, before or after closing an initial business combination. CFIUS may decide to block or delay our initial business combination, impose conditions to mitigate national security concerns with respect to such initial business combination or order us to divest all or a portion of a U.S. business of the combined company without first obtaining CFIUS clearance, which may limit the attractiveness of or prevent us from pursuing certain initial business combination opportunities that we believe would otherwise be beneficial to us and our stockholders. As a result, the pool of potential targets with which we could complete an initial business combination may be limited and we may be adversely affected in terms of competing with other special purpose acquisition companies which do not have similar foreign ownership issues. A failure to notify CFIUS of a transaction where such notification was required or otherwise

  warranted based on the national security considerations presented by an investment target may expose our sponsor and/or the combined company to legal penalties, costs, and/or other adverse reputational and financial effects, thus potentially diminishing the value of the combined company. In addition, CFIUS is actively pursuing transactions that were not notified to it and may ask questions regarding, or impose restrictions or mitigation on, an initial business combination post-closing. 
 Moreover, the process of government review, whether by the CFIUS or otherwise, could be lengthy and we have limited time to complete our initial business combination. If we cannot complete an initial business combination because the transaction is still under review or because our initial business combination is ultimately prohibited by CFIUS or another U.S. government entity, we may be required to liquidate. If we liquidate, our public stockholders may only receive their pro rate portion of the funds in the Trust Account that are available for distribution to public stockholders. This would cause public stockholders to lose the investment opportunity in a target company and the chance of realizing future gains on their investment through any price appreciation in the combined company.
