ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Introduction 
 Integrated Rail and Resources Acquisition Corp. (“Integrated Rail” or the “Company”) is a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on March 12, 2021, formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Form 10-K as our initial business combination. We have engaged in an extensive research effort to identify a large number of potential targets and have initiated discussions with initial business combination targets. 
 On November 16, 2021, Integrated Rail consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 23,000,000 units (the “Units”), including 3,000,000 Units issued pursuant to the exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in full, each Unit consisting of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”) and one-half of one redeemable warrant (“Warrant”). Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per whole share. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $230,000,000. On December 30, 2021, we issued a press release announcing that the holders of our Units may elect to separately trade the shares of Class A Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and the public warrants included in the units commencing on or about January 3, 2022. 
 The warrants will become exercisable 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination, and will expire five years after the completion of our initial business combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation, as described in this Form 10-K. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the units and only whole warrants will trade. Because Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, as representative of the several underwriters in our IPO (the “Underwriter”), exercised its over-allotment option in full our initial stockholders, which include our Sponsor (as defined below), did not forfeit any of their shares of the Company’s Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 (the “Founder Shares”). We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of our Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination, subject to the limitations described herein. If we do not complete our initial business combination within the Combination Period as described further herein, we will redeem 100% of the public shares for cash, subject to applicable law and certain conditions as further described herein. 
 We initially had 12 months from the November 16, 2021 closing of our IPO to consummate an initial business combination. On February 8, 2023, an Extension Amendment Proposal (as defined below) and a Trust Amendment Proposal (as defined below) were approved by our stockholders, and as a result, we extended the Combination Period through March 15, 2023 and the Company was granted the right to extend the Combination Period on a monthly basis up to five (5) times by an additional one (1) month each time until August 15, 2023. We may, but we are not obligated to, extend the period of time to consummate a business combination up to 21 months pursuant to the Extensions, as described in more detail in this Form 10-K. Public stockholders will not be offered the opportunity to vote on or redeem their shares in connection with any such extension. On March 13, 2023, the Sponsor loaned the Company $692,204 in order to extend the Combination Period to April 15, 2023. 
 Our Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 9,400,000 warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant ($9,400,000 in the aggregate) each exercisable to purchase one share of our Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, in a private placement that closed simultaneously with the closing of our IPO on November 16, 2021. These warrants are referenced herein as the private placement warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”). 
 Our initial stockholders, which include our Sponsor, and our anchor investors own an aggregate of 5,750,000 shares of our Class B common stock, which will automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock at the time of our initial business combination. 
 In addition, each of (i) Castle Creek Strategies LLC, Context Partners Master Fund, L.P., D. E. Shaw Valence Portfolios, L.L.C., Meteora Capital Partners, LP, HGC Investment Management Inc., Highbridge Capital Management, LLC, Radcliffe Capital Management, L.P., and Polar Asset Management Partners Inc., purchased 9.40% of the units offered in the IPO, excluding the shares sold pursuant to the underwriters’ exercise of the over-allotment option, (ii) Sandia Investment Management L.P. and Space Summit Capital LLC each purchased 7.50% of the units offered in the IPO, excluding the shares sold pursuant to the underwriters’ exercise of the over-allotment option, and (iii) Vestcor, Inc. and certain accounts managed by Eagle Point Credit Management LLC each purchased 4.90% of the units offered in the IPO, excluding the shares sold pursuant to the underwriters’ exercise of the over-allotment option, or in each case funds affiliated with such investors, together the anchor investors, for an aggregate purchase price of no more than $200 million, at the public offering price of the units. The anchor investors as a group purchased 20,000,000 units in the aggregate in our IPO, which was approximately 86.96% of the units issued in the IPO, including the shares sold pursuant to the underwriters’ exercise of the over-allotment option. Based on the amounts purchased at the time of our IPO, not all of the anchor investors were required to file Schedule 13Gs to report their beneficial ownership, so we do not know if all of the anchor investors continue to hold all of the shares they purchased in the IPO. Based on Schedule 13Gs filed by the Sponsor and certain of the anchor investors, as of the dates reflected in such Schedule 13Gs (see Item 12, Security 
 
4 


  Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters, below), our Sponsor and the anchor investors continued to hold (in the aggregate) at least 51.6% of our outstanding shares of common stock. We issued to the anchor investors 1,515,160 shares of our Class B common stock in connection with the closing of the IPO, and our Sponsor cancelled a like number of shares. Accordingly, because the anchor investors purchased the full amount of units in which they expressed an interest, the anchor investors owned an aggregate of approximately 74.84% of the outstanding shares of common stock immediately following the IPO and our Sponsor owned approximately 14.73% of the outstanding shares of common stock following immediately following the IPO. Because the anchor investors purchased all of the units that were allocated to them, even after taking into account such reductions as are necessary to comply with the NYSE listing requirements, substantially all of the units purchased in the IPO were held by the anchor investors and these investors potentially have different interests than our other public stockholders, as further discussed in this Form 10-K. The anchor investors will also have the potential to realize enhanced economic returns and overall economic outcome from their investment in us in comparison to our other public stockholders who did not make anchor investments and purchase founder shares. Because the anchor investors purchased all of the units that are allocated to them, even after taking into account such reductions as are necessary to comply with the NYSE listing requirements, the anchor investors’ purchases significantly reduced the available public float for our securities. Such reduction in our available public float may consequently reduce the trading volume, volatility, and liquidity of our securities relative to what they would have been had such units been purchased by public investors and could result in our securities being delisted from the NYSE. 
 Our IPO prospectus and our charter at the time of the IPO provided that we had 12 months from the date of our IPO (until November 16, 2022) to complete a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities (the “Combination Period”). At the time of the IPO, our charter and Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated November 11, 2021, by and between us and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC (the “Trust Agreement”), provided that we had the right to extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination up to two times by an additional three months each time (for a total of up to 18 months to complete a Business Combination) by depositing into the trust account maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee, an amount of $0.10 per unit sold to the public in the IPO for each such three-month extension (each, an “Extension Election”), as described in more detail in our IPO prospectus. The first Extension Election was used in November 2022 to extend the Combination Period to February 15, 2023 by depositing $2,300,000 into the Company’s trust account. 
 In a special meeting of the stockholders on February 8, 2023, an Extension Amendment Proposal and a Trust Amendment Proposal were approved, and as a result, we extended the Combination Period to March 15, 2023 and granted the Company the right to extend the Combination Period on a monthly basis up to five (5) times by an additional one (1) month each time after March 15, 2023 (each, an “Extension” and, collectively, the “Extensions”) or later extended deadline date, by resolution of the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”) if requested by the Sponsor. If the Board decides to implement an Extension, the Sponsor or its designees have agreed to contribute to us loans (the “Loans”) of $0.05 for each public share that is not redeemed (such amount, the “Monthly Amount”) plus (ii) because the Business Combination was not consummated by February 15, 2023, the Monthly Amount for each calendar month (commencing on February 16, 2023 and ending on the 15th day of each subsequent month), or portion thereof, that is needed by the Company to complete the Business Combination until August 15, 2023. Accordingly, the amount deposited per share depends on the number of public shares that remain outstanding after redemptions in connection with the Extension and the length of the extension period that will be needed to complete the Business Combination. The purpose of the Extension is to provide the Company more time to complete a Business Combination, which the Board believes is in the best interests of our stockholders. With the Extension Amendment Proposal approved, neither the Sponsor nor the Company is required to deposit additional funds into the trust account in connection with the Extension. 
 On March 13, 2023, the Sponsor loaned the Company $692,204 in order to extend the Combination Period to April 15, 2023. 
 In connection with the Extension Amendment Proposal, stockholders who owned shares of our common stock issued in our IPO (we refer to such stockholders as “public stockholders” and such shares as “public shares”) elected to redeem all or a portion of their public shares. Stockholders who elected to redeem, the redemption for a per-share price, payable in cash, was equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Company’s trust account, including interest (which interest was net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. As a result, 9,155,918 shares were redeemed at $10.32 per share, totaling $94,489,074. Therefore, as of February 8, 2023, there were 13,844,082 shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, issued and outstanding. As of March 16, 2023, there was $146,286,095 available in the trust account. 
 General 
 While we may pursue an initial business combination target in any stage of its corporate evolution or in any industry or sector, we have initially focused our search in North America on railroad companies that transport bulk commodities, terminal companies that transload bulk commodities to and from railroads and pipelines, trucks, and ports, the companies that produce bulk commodities moved by railroads in large volumes, and the rail cars that are used to transport bulk commodities. Bulk commodities include grains and vegetable oils, mineral and metallic ores and concentrates, energy fuels, biofuels, cement and aggregates, and other goods and commodities essential to modern economies. We believe that this vertical integration will enable synergies and economies of scale and leverage the inherent energy efficiency and low carbon emissions of freight trains, and the rapidly growing demand for bulk commodities necessary to transform industrialized economies into energy efficient and green economies, and to transform emerging economies into industrialized economies.

Acquisition Strategy 
 Our business strategy is to target, identify, and complete a business combination with one or more companies that produces bulk commodities and/or transports bulk commodities. We place particular focus on identifying businesses and business combinations that integrate natural resources and transportation services. 
 We believe that integration of bulk commodity production and transportation presents an attractive opportunity to pursue a business combination with a blank check company. We believe this business combination will enable us to leverage the production expertise and resource assets of bulk commodity producers, and the transportation assets and efficiency expertise of transportation providers. We believe our integrated approach will create production-to-destination cost efficiencies, market access opportunities, and pricing opportunities unavailable to stand-alone bulk commodity producers and transportation service providers. Transportation cost is a major component of the delivered cost of bulk commodities. We believe our expertise in solving transportation problems will enable the bulk commodity producers we target to enter new markets, unlock their resource assets, increase the value of their resource assets, and ultimately achieve higher market share, revenue, and netbacks, Similarly, we believe our integrated approach will 
 
7 


  enable the transportation service providers we target to make operational and infrastructure efficiency improvements that will achieve long-term market share, revenue, and profitability improvements. We believe integration of production and transportation will result in a business combination that provides the transportation company with long-term access to bulk commodities, the resource company with long-term transportation cost efficiency, and the integrated company with market share, pricing power, profitability, and growth opportunities that are not inaccessible to non-integrated producers and transportation providers competing for the same end users of the bulk commodities. 
 We believe that our integrated bulk commodity and transportation opportunities include: 
 

• | Bulk Commodity Producers with insufficient access to low-cost, high-capacity, high-efficiency transportation services from origin to market for bulk commodities, due to insufficient operational and market integration with their transportation service providers;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Transportation Service Providers with insufficient volumes to leverage their inherent infrastructure and operational efficiency assets and expertise, due to insufficient integration with their bulk commodity customers;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Bulk Commodity Producers and Transportation Service Providers that individually lack the ability to market and execute long-term, high-efficiency, high-netback bulk commodity sales agreements.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our acquisition strategy leverages our team’s deep understanding of the bulk commodity industries that we have managed or advised throughout our careers, including operating successful railway and transportation enterprises. We believe this cross-sector expertise is unusual in both the railroad industry and the bulk commodity industry. Our management team, led by Mr. Michel, has experience: 
 

• | Operating railroad companies, evaluating the business opportunities of railroad companies, developing bulk commodity transportation opportunities, and identifying and recruiting talent in the railroad industry;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Developing market-access strategies for bulk commodity customers in regions and industries overlooked or insufficiently served by others, including grain, ethanol, and steel opportunities in central Nebraska, grain opportunities in the northern Great Plains, animal feed, steel, energy fuels, and fertilizer opportunities in Mexico, aggregates opportunities on the Gulf Coast, grain, petroleum products and import-export opportunities on the Lower Mississippi River, and crude oil production and export opportunities in Utah’s Uinta Basin; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Developing and growing companies, both organically and inorganically.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe there are opportunities in the bulk commodity production and transportation services industries that will benefit from our integrated approach and expertise, with significant value creation upon completion of a business combination and a public listing for the target company. 
 Following the closing of our IPO on November 16, 2021, we commenced our search for a potential initial business combination of one or more businesses. 
 Investment Criteria 
 Consistent with our strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective business targets. We use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. 
 We believe there are a considerable number of target businesses in the bulk commodity production and transportation service industries that can benefit from new capital to scale operations and from integration of production and transportation, which we believe will generate substantial revenue and earnings growth. 
 
8 


 We intend to acquire one or more businesses that we believe have one or more of the following characteristics: 
 

• | Stranded Assets. We are identifying bulk commodity producers, or transportation service providers, that through integration between production and transportation functions, and integration of management expertise and knowledge, will unlock stranded or underutilized production and transportation assets. We are pursuing business combination opportunities within the railroad and bulk commodity sectors to achieve integrated efficiencies and market leverage not available to these companies acting independently. If we vertically integrate this market, we believe it will allow us to lock in the value of the complete commodity supply chain, achieve market leverage, and provide commodity consumers with guaranteed sourcing and logistics solutions. This in turn reduces their market exposure and enables them to provide long-term take-or-pay contracts at terms attractive to our company.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Control of Undervalued Commodity Assets. We believe certain producers of bulk commodities, such as grains and vegetable oils, mineral and metallic ores and concentrates, energy fuels, biofuels, cement and aggregates, and other goods and commodities essential to modern economies, are undervalued for one or more of the following reasons: the producer’s lack of cost-effective transport to market, the difficult and lengthy regulatory process to permit and license new production and transportation assets, and the market not appreciating the limited supply of the producer’s bulk commodities or the increase in demand for bulk commodities that we believe will occur in the developing world as it seeks to modernize. We believe most market analysis unduly discounts the potential for development and demand for commodities among the 82 percent of the world’s population that lives in countries classified by the United Nations as Medium or Low Human Development.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Emissions Profiles that Enable Governments to Meet Carbon Emission Reduction Goals. Railroads emit 1.5 to 5 times less greenhouse gas emissions than trucks, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. We believe demand for railroad services, and railroad pricing power, will increase substantially as North American governments either institute carbon taxation schemes, carbon emissions reduction schemes, or make direct investment into freight and passenger railroad infrastructure in order to reduce reliance on trucks and privately owned internal-combustion engine vehicles. We also believe demand for certain fossil fuels will grow during transition to zero-net carbon emissions infrastructure and transportation, because they offer significantly reduced carbon and other deleterious emissions per unit of transportation output or heating output, compared to existing sources. In particular, we believe demand for natural gas and crude oils with low- or near-zero sulfur and metals content will supplant or eliminate coal and crude oils with high sulfur and metals content in world markets.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Control of Commodity Assets or Transportation Services for Commodity Producers with Exceptional Growth Potential. Demand for bulk commodities including copper, nickel, lithium, rare earths, and other metals and non-metallic minerals essential to electric vehicles, electrical power generation, and electrical power transmission is expected to grow at least 5-fold by 2050, according to the World Bank, and as much as 10 fold according to industry news sources including mining.com. We believe that demand growth will include pricing power both for commodity producers as well as transportation providers, particularly because railroad transportation of bulk commodities is not readily replaced by truck, and because we believe regulatory constraints on pipeline construction and replacement will become increasingly onerous.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Significant Barriers to Entry. We are targeting businesses or assets where new entrants are constrained by lengthy, complicated, or expensive barriers to entry, such as environmental clearances and permits, linear right-of-way acquisition, public lands entry, or market dominance regulations. In particular, railroads cannot readily be replicated, expansion into new markets is difficult and onerous for large railroad companies, and permitting of resource extraction on federal, tribal, or state lands is lengthy and complex.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Effecting a Business Combination General 
 We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from one or a combination of the following: the proceeds of the IPO and the private placement of the private warrants, proceeds from the sale of additional securities, the issuance of shares or other securities, or new debt. We may seek to consummate our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth (such as a company that has begun operations but is not yet at the stage of commercial manufacturing and sales), which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. 
 If our initial business combination is paid for using shares or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the purchase price in connection with our business combination or used for redemptions of purchases of our common stock, we may apply the cash released to us from the trust account that is not applied to the purchase price for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. 
 Since the consummation of the IPO, we have focused on identifying, doing due diligence on and speaking to management of potential target companies in a variety of markets within our target sectors. Subject to the requirement that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses or assets having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable) at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination, we have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses.

 Our IPO prospectus and the charter in effect at the time of the IPO provided that we had 12 months from the date of our IPO (until November 16, 2022) to complete a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities (the “Combination Period”). At the time of our IPO, our charter and Trust Agreement provided that we had the right to extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination up to two times by an additional three months each time (for a total of up to 18 months to complete a Business Combination) by depositing into the trust account maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee, an amount of $0.10 per unit sold to the public in the IPO for each such three-month extension (each, an “Extension Election”), as described in more detail in our IPO prospectus. The first Extension Election was used in November 2022 to extend the Combination Period to February 15, 2023 by depositing $2,300,000 into the Company’s trust account. 
 In a special meeting of the stockholders on February 8, 2023, an Extension Amendment Proposal and a Trust Amendment Proposal were approved, and as a result, we extended the Combination Period to March 15, 2023 and granted the Company the right to extend the Combination Period on a monthly basis up to five (5) times by an additional one (1) month each time after March 15, 2023 or later extended deadline date, by resolution of the Board if requested by the Sponsor. If the Board decides to implement an Extension, the Sponsor or its designees have agreed to contribute to us Loans of $0.05 for each public share that is not redeemed plus (ii) because the Business Combination was not consummated by February 15, 2023, the Monthly Amount for each calendar month (commencing on February 16, 2023 and ending on the 15th day of each subsequent month), or portion thereof, that is needed by the Company to complete the Business Combination until August 15, 2023. Accordingly, the amount deposited per share will depend on the number of public shares that remain outstanding after redemptions in connection with the Extension and the length of the extension period that will be needed to complete the Business Combination. The purpose of the Extension is to provide the Company more time to complete a Business Combination, which the Board believes is in the best interests of our stockholders. With the Extension Amendment Proposal approved, neither the Sponsor nor the Company is required to deposit additional funds into the trust account in connection with the Extension. 
 In connection with the Extension Amendment Proposal, stockholders who owned shares of our common stock issued in our IPO (we refer to such stockholders as “public stockholders” and such shares as “public shares”) elected to redeem all or a portion of their public shares. Stockholders who elected to redeem, the redemption for a per-share price, payable in cash, was equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Company’s trust account, including interest (which interest was net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. As a result, 9,155,918 shares were redeemed at $10.32 per share, totaling $94,489,074. Therefore, as of February 8, 2023, there were 13,844,082 shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, issued and outstanding. As of March 16, 2023, there was $146,286,095 available in the trust account. 
 On February 17, 2023, the Sponsor loaned the Company $692,204 in order to extend the Combination Period to March 15, 2023. On March 13, 2023, the Sponsorloaned the Company $692,204 in order to extend the Combination Period to April 15, 2023. 
 We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination, and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would consummate such financing only simultaneously with the consummation of our business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law or the NYSE, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise. 
 Members of our management team directly or indirectly own a portion of our founders shares, common stock and/or Private Placement Warrants and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors were to be included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. 
 Sources of Target Businesses 
 Target business candidates may be brought to our attention from various sources, including unaffiliated sources such as investment bankers and investment professionals. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us by calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read the final prospectus relating to our IPO (Registration Statement on Form S-1, File No. 333-256381 (the “Registration Statement”)) as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on November 12, 2021, and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as our Sponsor and its affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as 
 
10 


  attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we may receive proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors and our Sponsor and their respective industry and business contacts as well as their affiliates. We may engage professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee, advisory fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. Payment of finder’s fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. In no event, however, will our Sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which our Sponsor or officers are affiliated, be paid any finder’s fee, reimbursement, consulting fee, monies in respect of any payment of a loan or other compensation by the company prior to, or in connection with any services rendered for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). Although none of our Sponsor, executive officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, will be allowed to receive any compensation, finder’s fees or consulting fees from a prospective business combination target in connection with a contemplated initial business combination, we do not have a policy that prohibits our Sponsor, executive officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, from negotiating for the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses by a target business. 
 We have agreed to pay our Sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support and to reimburse our Sponsor for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating and completing an initial business combination. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-transaction company following our initial business combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements is not being used as a criterion in our selection process of an initial business combination candidate. 
 We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with an initial business combination target that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors or making the initial business combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our Sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with an initial business combination target that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or from another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. 
 Potential target companies with whom we may engage in discussions may have had prior discussions with other blank check companies, bankers in the industry and/or other professional advisors including blank check companies with which our executive officers or board of directors were affiliated. We may pursue transactions with such potential targets (i) if such other blank check companies are no longer pursuing transactions with such potential targets, (ii) if we become aware that such potential targets are interested in a potential initial business combination with us and (iii) if we believe such transactions would be attractive to our stockholders. As more fully discussed in the section of this Form 10-K titled “Conflicts of Interest,” if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an initial business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Our officers and directors currently have certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us. 
 Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of our Initial Business Combination 
 The NYSE rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. The fair market value of our initial business combination will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation, a valuation based on trading multiples of comparable public businesses or a valuation based on the financial metrics of M&A transactions of comparable businesses. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. Our board of directors may not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target’s assets or prospects. 
 We will not purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. We anticipate structuring our initial business combination either (i) in such a way so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses, or (ii) in such a way so that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target 
 
11 


  management team or stockholders. However, we will only complete an initial business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act rules and regulations. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of the NYSE’s 80% fair market value test. If the initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the transactions and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable. 
 To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure our stockholders that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors. 
 The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. 
 Competition 
 In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, there is competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic business combinations. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses is limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the initial business combination of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination. 
Management Operating and Investment Experience 
 We believe that our executive officers possess the experience, skills and contacts necessary to source, evaluate, and execute an attractive business combination. See the section titled “Our Management Team” for complete information on the experience of our officers and directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers and directors are not required to commit their full time to our affairs and can allocate their time to other businesses. Each of our employees to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business (which could range from only a few hours a week while we are trying to locate a potential target business to a majority of their time as we move into serious negotiations with a target business for a business combination). The past successes of our executive officers and directors do not guarantee that we will successfully consummate an initial business combination. 
 As more fully discussed in “Sources of Target Businesses,” if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Delaware law, prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Most of our officers and directors currently have certain pre-existing fiduciary duties or contractual obligations.

 Emerging Growth Company Status and Other Information 
 We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the “Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 
 In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are taking advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the closing of our IPO on November 16, 2021 (i.e., November 16, 2026), (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A common stock that is held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to emerging growth company will have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act. 
 Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30th, or (2) our annual revenues exceed $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30. 
 Employees 
 We currently have three executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they each devote as much of their time as they each deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will each devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination. 
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 
 Our units, shares, and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public auditors. You can read our SEC filings over the internet at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov or on the Company’s website at http://irr-x.com/. 
 We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to shareholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, U.S. GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material. 
 We are required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022, as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
