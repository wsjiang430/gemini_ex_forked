Item 1. Business
Overview



HealthLynked Corp. (the “Company,” “we,” “our,”) is a growth stage company incorporated in the state of Nevada on August 6, 2014. We currently operate in three distinct divisions: the Health Services Division, the Digital Healthcare Division, and the Medical Distribution Division.



The Health Services division is comprised of the operations of (i) Naples Women’s Center (“NWC”), a multi-specialty medical group including OB/GYN (both Obstetrics and Gynecology) and General Practice, (ii) Naples Center for Functional Medicine (“NCFM”), a Functional Medical Practice engaged in improving the health of its patients through individualized and integrative health care, (iii) Bridging the Gap Physical Therapy (“BTG”), a physical therapy practice in Bonita Springs, FL that provides hands-on functional manual therapy techniques to speed patients’ recovery and manage pain without pain medication or surgery, and (iv) Aesthetic Enhancements Unlimited (“AEU”), a patient service facility specializing in minimally and non-invasive cosmetic services acquired by the Company in May 2022.



The Digital Healthcare division develops and operates an online personal medical information and record archive system, the “HealthLynked Network,” which enables patients and doctors to keep track of medical information via the Internet in a cloud-based system.



The Medical Distribution Division is comprised of the operations of MedOffice Direct LLC (“MOD”), a virtual distributor of discounted medical supplies selling to both consumers and medical practices throughout the United States.



During October 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved a plan to sell the Company’s ACO/MSO (Accountable Care Organization / Managed Service Organization) Division, comprised of the operations of Cura Health Management LLC (“CHM”) and its subsidiary ACO Health Partners LLC (“AHP”), which operate an Accountable Care Organization (“ACO”) and Managed Service Organization (“MSO”) that assists physician practices in providing coordinated and more efficient care to patients via the Medicare Shared Savings Program (“MSSP”) as administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (the “CMS”). On January 17, 2023, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “AHP Merger Agreement”) pursuant to which PBACO Holding, LLC, an operator of ACOs, (“Buyer”) agreed to buy, and the Company agreed to sell, AHP.



Health Services Division



In August 2014, we acquired NWC, an Obstetrical and Gynecological practice in Naples, Florida established in 1996 that provides medical services to patients in the Southwest Florida region. NWC currently employs one part-time gynecological physician and two nurse practitioners, along with support staff. The services offered include general physical exams, surgical procedures such as hysterectomy, bladder incontinence procedures, pelvic reconstruction, sterilization, endometrial ablation, advanced robotic surgery, contraceptive management and infertility testing and treatment.



On April 12, 2019, we acquired a 100% interest in Hughes Center for Functional Medicine (“HCFM”), a medical practice engaged in improving the health of its patients through individualized and integrative health care. HCFM, which was rebranded as NCFM upon acquisition, is a leader in functional medicine focusing on neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and Multiple Sclerosis. NCFM employs three physicians, four nurses and support staff. NCFM provides cutting-edge treatments to improve health and slow aging, including hormones, thyroid treatment, weight loss, wellness and prevention. NCFM’s income streams are derived from Medical Membership fees, Concierge Service fees, patient office visits, a dedicated IV room, hyperbaric oxygen chambers, ozone, UVlrx, DNA sequence testing and the sale of supplements.

During the fourth quarter of 2022, NCFM launched its Medical Membership and Concierge programs. Under the Medical Membership program, patients pay a base annual fee of $1,500 ($1,000 for patients ages 18-25, $750 for minor living with a member) and receive fixed rates for services used during the year, a free nurse practitioner consultation, priority scheduling, and a one-year HealthLynked Network membership. NCFM also offered a limited number of Silver ($10,000 per year), Gold ($15,000 per year) and Platinum ($30,000 per year) Concierge Memberships that, in addition to the benefits of the Medical Membership, include varying bundles of prepaid services during the one-year term of the membership, discounts on products and other priority benefits, including home health visits. Approximately 78% of NCFM patients stayed with their participating physician, 14% transferred to our newly hired physician, and only 8% left the practice. The Medical Membership and Concierge programs generated in excess of $725,000 in incremental annual revenue.



On May 13, 2022, we acquired AEU, a patient service facility specializing in minimally and non-invasive cosmetic services including fat reduction, body sculpting, wrinkle reduction, hair removal, IV hydration, and feminine rejuvenation. AEU employes a part-time physician, two aestheticians and a nurse practitioner, along with support staff.



In January 2020, we launched a new physical therapy practice in Bonita Springs, Florida called Bridging the Gap Physical Therapy (“BTG”). BTG employs one physical therapist who provides hands-on functional manual therapy techniques to speed patients’ recovery and manage pain without pain medication or surgery.



Medical Distribution Division



In October 2020, we acquired MOD, a Naples, Florida-based virtual distributor of discounted medical supplies selling to both consumers and medical practices throughout the United States. With over 13,000 name brand medical products in over 150 different categories, MOD leverages Group Purchasing Organization (GPO) pricing discounts with a small unit-of-measure direct-to-consumer shipping model to make ordering medical supplies both convenient and highly cost-effective for its users. The MOD online marketplace can be found at www.medofficedirect.com.



In November 2022, MOD partnered with Synchrony Bank’s CareCredit healthcare credit card to allow MOD customers to finance home medical equipment and medical supplies purchases.



In December 2022, MOD introduced a loyalty points reward system pursuant to which MedOfficeDirect customers earn 1 point for every dollar they spend on the MOD site. Points can be applied to receive discounts on future purchases. Under the plan, registered reward members can also refer other new users and earn points when the person they referred makes a purchase.



Digital HealthCare Division



We operate a cloud-based Patient Information Network (PIN) and record archiving system, referred to as the “HealthLynked Network”, which enables patients and doctors to keep track of medical information via the Internet in a cloud-based system. Through our website, www.HealthLynked.com and our mobile apps, patients can complete a detailed online personal medical history including past surgical history, medications, allergies, and family medical history. Once this information is entered, patients and their treating physicians are able to update the information as needed, to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date medical history.



We believe that the HealthLynked Network offers several advantages to patients and physicians not available in the market today. We provide a comprehensive marketing solution allowing physicians to market to both active and inactive patients, and an easy-to-use connection at the point of care through our Patient Access Hub (“PAH”). Patient members can access medical newsfeeds and groups. Our real-time appointment scheduling application allows for patients to book appointments online with participating and non-participating healthcare providers through our call center. Our database and record archives allow for seamless sharing of medical records between healthcare providers and keeps patients in control of shared access. In the HealthLynked Network, parents can create accounts for their children that are linked to their family account, allowing them to provide access to healthcare providers, track vaccination records, and allow hospitals and schools access to important medical information in case of emergencies. The HealthLynked Network is accessible 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, via the internet and on mobile applications for both Android and iOS devices. We believe this type of accessibility is important for schools and during office visits, but more important, in times of a medical emergency.





2







We anticipate that our system will also provide for 24-hour access to medical specialist healthcare providers who can answer medical questions and direct appropriate care to paying members. In addition to 24-hour access, patients may also schedule telemedicine consultations at set times with participating healthcare providers who have expertise in various specialized areas of medicine. Participating physicians can elect to allow patients to request online appointments either via our real-time app or by setting, in their administrator dashboard panel, times and days of the week that patients may request appointments. Appointment requests are then sent by our system to an email address specified by the physician’s office, requesting a follow up to confirm or automatically accept the appointment request.



HealthLynked has created 880,000 physician base profiles for most physicians in the United States, which are searchable on the Internet. Physicians can claim their profiles confirming the accuracy of the information free of charge.



There are three types of providers in the HealthLynked Network: in-network, out-of-network and participating providers. All physicians can claim their profile and update basic information online and add videos and images of their profile. Once a provider has claimed their profile, they are considered in-network. Providers that opt to pay a monthly fee for access to the full range of HealthLynked Network services, which include online scheduling, marketing services and analytics about their practice performance are considered “Participating Providers.”



HealthLynked provider profiles enable Participating Providers to market directly to patients through our PAH and direct QR code processing technology and online marketing services to recruit new patients and reengage with former patients. Physician practices generate more income the more patients they treat, so maximizing efficiency and patient turnover is critical to increasing total revenues and profitability. As such, we believe that our system will enable physicians to reduce the amount of time required to process patient intake forms, as patients will no longer be required to spend ten to thirty minutes filling out forms at each visit, and the practices’ staff will not need to input this information multiple times into their electronic medical records systems. Patients complete their online profiles once, and thereafter, they and their physicians are able to update their profiles as needed. Physicians participating in the HealthLynked Network are required to update the patient records within 24 hours of seeing the patient. The information is organized in an easy-to-read format to enable a physician to review the necessary information quickly during, and prior to, patient visits, which in turn facilitates a more comprehensive and effective patient encounter. 



Patient data is stored in conformity with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and the regulations promulgated under each by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Civil Rights (collectively, “HIPAA”). The network utilizes Amazon AWS infrastructure which uses Amazon HIPPA compliant servers along with Amazon RDS with LAMP, HTML5 and several JavaScript frameworks, including Angular and React. Recommendations for end users are a 512 kbps+ internet connection speed and a web browser such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Safari or handheld devices such as iOS devices, android phones or tablets. Our developers utilize third party controls for functionality and user interface where the use of those controls adds value to the system beyond custom creation of new tools. We intend to adjust forward compatibility for major browser version updates, new browsers, operating system updates or new operating system as needed. The HealthLynked Network is EMR agnostic, and is compatible with all electronic medical records systems, allowing for minimal barriers to participation and broader penetration of the market.



The HealthLynked Network- How It Works



Our system walks patients through a series of easy-to-use pages with point and click selections and drop-down menus that allow them to enter their past medical history, past surgical history, allergies, medications, and family medical history. In addition, members can create accounts for children under the age of 18 and keep track of required visits and vaccines. Members select physicians, schools, hospitals and other parties to whom they wish to grant access to their records. This access can be either ongoing, or restricted by time and date, in accordance with the patient’s control settings.



Practices are required to have a claimed active account in order to access patients’ online records and receive referrals for new patients. Once a patient has granted the practice access to their medical charts, office intake paperwork can be downloaded by the practice without the need for the patient to fill out lengthy and repetitive paperwork. Upon completion of the office visit, practices are required to upload the patient’s medical record into the online patients’ file within 24 hours via eFax, APIs with select EMRs (including AthenaNet) or through the HealthLynked Portal. Each patient’s account has a unique bar code that when faxed into our system is recognized for that patient, and archived in the patient’s chart, by date and provider. The HealthLynked Network is independent of any EMR system and physicians only require a fax machine or computer to participate, allowing for minimal barriers to participation and broader penetration of the market.





3







In addition to serving as a complete medical record archive, we believe that the HealthLynked Network allows for shorter wait times at doctors’ offices by giving doctors immediate access to patients’ complete medical information, insurance information and required treatment consent forms. Patients only need to verify their treating physician’s access to their files upon or prior to their next doctor’s visit. Patients are also able to coordinate multiple physician visits and keep an updated and complete personal medical record archive. These files may also be shared among a patient’s different specialty physicians, a function that we believe is especially helpful for patients who travel and may need to access their records or obtain physician referrals in multiple localities. We also believe that the HealthLynked Network is especially useful in medical emergencies when patients are unable to provide a medical history on their own because our system allows patients the option to grant healthcare providers, in advance, special access in emergency situations. 



The HealthLynked Network also provides an online scheduling function for patients to book appointments with participating and non-participating practices through the use of our Online Concierge staffed call center. The Online Concierge service allows participating healthcare providers to offer specific times for available appointments. If a practice or provider has not yet claimed their listing in the HealthLynked Network directory, HealthLynked’s concierge team facilitates the appointment request with that provider on behalf of the patient.

Applications, Product Releases, and Partnerships



During February 2020, we released our COVID-19 tracker application for IOS mobile devices. We released our Android version on March 5, 2020. The application allows users to report how they are feeling and if they are having any symptoms consistent with COVID-19 infection. In addition, the application includes a detailed global map tracking the virus, the latest twitter feeds, and a real-time chat for users to engage with people from around the world to share information. The application had over six million downloads in a ten-week period after launch and was the number one tracking application in the Apple Medical Store for the month of March 2020. During January 2022, we launched an update to the app to include confirmed cases of the Omicron variant, as reported by the CDC and local state health departments.

During October 2020 we launched Oohvie, a new iOS application focused on women’s healthcare. Oohvie offers unique features over competitive menstrual tracking apps, including the ability to connect with a user’s healthcare providers and share menstrual cycle data. This important information allows gynecologists to better evaluate patients for the causes of hormonal irregularities, infertility, pelvic pain, endometriosis and many other medical conditions and provides data that could help identify gynecological problems such as fibroids, polyps, or cervical or uterine cancer. Oohvie users also have access to a health forum designed specifically for women, covering topics such as contraception, menopause, hormones, pregnancy, sexual health, and pelvic infections. Oohvie offers a real time chat feature where users can discuss their experiences with birth control pills, menstrual symptoms, and other issues in private. In addition, users can purchase name brand feminine hygiene products that are shipped directly to their home at significantly discounted prices. Users can also use the app to schedule reminders for taking birth control pills or hormones. During May 2022, we launched an update to the Oohvie app that allows users to chat with a live nurse to answer their medical questions and order feminine products at low cost.




During February 2021, we released CareLynk, an innovative AI-enabled healthcare directory allowing users to call one number and connect to any doctor across the U.S. CareLynk utilizes natural language processing (NLP) and voice-to-text technology to understand what healthcare provider a caller is looking for. The system includes doctors from over 88 different medical specialties. Providers can be located by last name, zip code and specialty. Results are filtered in order of relevance allowing the user to quickly and efficiently locate the provider they are searching for, hands-free. CareLynk was first released in Florida, connecting patients to over 33,000 doctors throughout the state. CareLynk, which is capable of connecting to over 300,000 doctors across all 50 states, is expected to be expanded to include the rest of the United States in 2023.



During April 2021, we launched DocLynk, a telemedicine service enabling users to connect to healthcare providers in the HealthLynked Network from the convenience of their home by phone, web or mobile app.



During September 2021, we released QwikCheck, a streamlined process for practices to institute remote patient check-in without the need for any additional hardware. The QwikCheck system uses dynamic linking, which allows a single QR code tied to a practice that works seamlessly with both Android and iOS platforms. Patients can check in for their doctor’s appointment using their mobile devices regardless of their smart phone’s operating system, age, or model. QwikCheck allows patients to maintain social distance from the office staff and other patients while waiting for their appointments. Patient intake information is provided to the practice via the application and eliminates front office exposure, time and redundant paperwork. QwikCheck also provides all the back-end analytics for practices to manage their patient flow and optimize their provider’s schedules.



During December 2022, we announced an affiliation agreement with Fitness International, LLC, the operator of L.A. Fitness, City Sports Club, and Esporta Fitness brands. Under the agreement, HealthLynked Network Members will be eligible for certain discounts at Fitness International’s clubs across the U.S.



In January 2023, we introduced significant enhancements to our Telehealth Service delivered through the HealthLynked app and web portal. The upgraded Telehealth Service platform includes the unique ability for both patients and physicians to have immediate access to patient records and allows for the downloading of medical images that could play a crucial role in the telehealth patient care experience. We also manage all services associated with the Telehealth Service platform, including scheduling, documentation, and patient and physician communication. HealthLynked Telehealth Service is available at a fixed fee of $60 per visit and is available immediately in Florida.



In March 2023, we announced the launch of our Online Concierge service for physician appointment bookings. Patients can now book appointments with any healthcare provider across the country through the HealthLynked Network’s online medical directory of over 880,000 healthcare providers and practice locations. The new Online Concierge service allows participating healthcare providers to offer specific times for available appointments. If a practice or provider has not yet claimed their listing in the HealthLynked Network directory, our concierge team will facilitate the appointment request with that provider. Once patients have booked an appointment, they can download the HealthLynked app and update their medical information in their secure HealthLynked profile. HealthLynked’s concierge nurse staff is available to help patients update their health records for their upcoming appointment if needed.



Business Model



Our business model is focused on market penetration and recruiting physician practices and patients to use our system for archiving patient medical records, comprehensive marketing to active and inactive patients, connecting on a regular basis utilizing news feeds and groups, accessing new patients, and for on-line “real-time” scheduling physician appointments.



We charge physician practices a subscription fee between $300 and $400 per month to participate in the network, depending on the level of access and functionality. Participating practices upload their patient files into a secure patient portal to market to their active and inactive patients. The practices initially send to all of their patients an email invitation to claim their HLYK profiles free of charge, update their profiles and bring their profiles with them to their next visit to the physician’s office.



We also anticipate charging certain healthcare facilities either an annual or monthly fee that will vary per facility based upon number of professionals per facility. Currently, it is anticipated that hospitals and emergency rooms would be charged a higher fee for our services once our patient and physician network has been expanded.



The base services of the HealthLynked Network are free for patients. Access to the Online Concierge service, including personalized appointment scheduling, 24-hour nurse hotline, and telehealth, was available for a free 30-day trial following its launch and thereafter paid member plans start at $10/month per patient, or $20/month for a family plan.

We initially began deployment of the HealthLynked Network by registering NWC’s approximately 6,000 active patients and 6,500 inactive patients. We then added patients from the healthcare providers serviced by CHM and AHP following our 2020 acquisition of CHM and AHP. While we have generated minimal revenues from physician and patient fees related to such deployment through 2022, we believe that establishing the patient database will be a valuable marketing tool for telesales, product sales and other marketing opportunities to physician practices and patients. With the sale of AHP in January 2023, we began offering our online concierge service to the buyer’s patients and our practice tools to the buyer’s ACO participating practices.



HealthLynked has launched other applications that provide valuable user patient services while also growing the number of patients in the HealthLynked Network. We launched women’s health application Oohvie, with a new subscription plan as part of our Online Concierge service, including new features. The original free launch had over 30,000 downloads free of charge.



During 2021, we updated our COVID-19 tracker application to include Omicron variant cases. The original tracker launched in March 2020 had over 4 million downloads in the first 45 days and was the number one tracking app in the Apple medical store. We also launched our automated phone routing system, CareLynk, allowing patients to connect with any doctor in the United States via AI enabled speech recognition system, a new telemedicine platform, DocLynk, and QwikCheck, a streamlined process for practices to institute remote patient check-in.



These applications and others are for the purpose of providing specific services to our patients and physician practices and to help grow the number of users in the HealthLynked Network.



Sales Strategy



Starting in 2019, we deployed our PAH, providing free Wi-Fi to practice patients at no cost to our in-network physicians. Physician members receive patient analytics from the PAH. In 2021 we developed software where we can offer the same services the PAH offered using direct QR code technology, without the PAH hardware requirement. Our marketing efforts towards physicians emphasize how our systems can provide patient analytics, increase practice revenues, improve office efficiencies, and improve the accuracy of recorded patients’ medical histories. Once a physician becomes a HealthLynked Network member, they upload all their patient files in a secured portal in the cloud, email their patients to claim their profiles, update them and bring their profiles in for their next office visit.



We also utilize internet-based search engine marketing and optimization (SEM/SEO) to increase our presence in certain targeted geographical areas. These campaigns are focused on both physician practices and patients. We believe that direct-to-consumer marketing through email campaigns is an effective way to build interest and drive patient and physician practice demand for our services. We anticipate that we will be able to foster faster market penetration and increase demand for our services by marketing to both consumers and physician practices.



Our campaigns direct patients to look for physician practices in the HealthLynked Network to ensure that they maintain the accuracy and completeness of their medical records. Our system further allows patients to search for “in-network” physician providers and schedule online “real-time” appointments via our system. We believe that physician practices in the HealthLynked Network will see an increase in new patients as a result of their participation and as more patients claim their profiles, from the use of the PAH, our new direct QR code software option, and our digital marketing campaigns. The value to physician practices for joining our network will increase from not only existing patient marketing, but also for acquisition of new patients registered in the HealthLynked Network.



Our new applications, Oohvie, COVID-19 tracker, CareLynk and DocLynk were all launched with the purpose of growing the HealthLynked Network and generating incremental revenue for the business. These services are being marketed by our executive team to large health systems, hospitals, universities and other potential clients and ACO partners.



We also believe that affiliated marketing campaigns will be very helpful in attracting new users and increasing market awareness. We intend to partner with pharmaceutical companies, medical distributors, insurance companies, medical societies, large healthcare systems and others to cross market our products.



Intellectual Property



On March 7, 2023, we were issued patent No. 11600395 by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the “USPTO”). The patent, entitled “Secure patient access via healthcare service provider specific wireless access point,” encompasses systems and methods for providing a healthcare service provider-specific wireless access point, or “HUB”, that facilitates secure communication amongst patients, providers, and third-party services. When in range of the HUB (e.g., in a doctor’s office waiting room), patient devices can connect to the healthcare service provider’s wireless access point. The access point can be configured to detect the presence of a patient device, obtain identifying information, and send the information to a server. The server uses the obtained information to create or update a profile for the patient associated with their device. This profile can be updated with additional information derived from the patient’s interaction with the network, provider input, or the patient updating their profile or inputting additional information. This innovative approach allows for streamlined communication and enhanced data security within the healthcare setting.



We have registered “HealthLynked” and our corporate logo as a service mark with the USPTO.



Research and Development



Our research and development efforts consist of building, developing, and enhancing the HealthLynked Network, including comprehensive marketing to active and inactive patients, the real time scheduling of appointments through our new mobile application, regular appointment scheduling, telemedicine appointment scheduling, sharing of secured documents between physicians and patients, and independent access via mobile, tablet and web browser. Further, we are developing our systems to provide for secured data storage, drug interaction alerts, and the barcoding of documents for retrieval and storage.

Professional and General Liability Coverage



We maintain directors’ and officers’, professional and general liability insurance policies with third-party insurers generally on a claims-made basis, subject to deductibles, policy aggregates, exclusions, and other restrictions, in accordance with standard industry practice. We believe that our insurance coverage is appropriate based upon our claims experience and the nature and risks of our business. However, no assurance can be given that any pending or future claim against us will not be successful or if successful, will not exceed the limits of available insurance coverage. Our business entails an inherent risk of claims of medical malpractice against our affiliated physicians and us. We contract and pay premiums for professional liability insurance that indemnifies us and our affiliated healthcare professionals generally on a claims-made basis for losses incurred related to medical malpractice litigation. Professional liability coverage is required in order for our physicians to maintain hospital privileges.
Employees



As of March 30, 2023, we had 53 employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be excellent.
Competition



The markets for our Digital Healthcare products and services are highly competitive and are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and product standards, as well as frequent introduction of new products and services. Most of our competitors are more established, benefit from greater name recognition, and have substantially greater financial, technical, and marketing resources than we do. Our principal existing competitors include, but are not limited to, ZocDoc, Inc., AthenaHealth Inc., All-scripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc., Cerner Corporation, Epic Systems Corporation, Teledoc Health Inc., Veritone Inc., Oscar Health, Good RX and Doximity. In addition, we expect that major software information systems companies, large information technology consulting service providers, start-up companies, managed care companies and others specializing in the health care industry may offer competitive products and services. Amazon, Google, and Apple have also entered into the digital healthcare space, including in the area of patient health records.



We believe that we differ from our competitors in that we are not a practice management software or an EMR provider. Companies like AthenaHealth Inc., Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc., Cerner and Epic Systems Corporation offer software solutions to operate and manage a medical practice. Functions of these systems include patient billing, monitoring patient account balances and payments, tracking of appointments and creating encounter visits and a medical record for each patient seen. HealthLynked works in conjunction with these practice management software systems and does not seek to replace them. Patients’ medical records created by these systems are uploaded to the patient’s profile in the HealthLynked Network. The HealthLynked Network can incorporate any physical or digital documents into a patient’s medical record history and thus allow it to be utilized across all healthcare platforms. HealthLynked provides an online appointment scheduling application that is similar to ZocDoc, Inc.’s offering, but in addition offers telemedicine appointments through our own patient interface, and we do not charge practices for cancelled appointments. 



The advantage of having a healthcare network independent of any one practice management or EMR software allows the HealthLynked system to be fully utilized across the entire medical community. Integration and participation by both patients and healthcare providers in a unified platform offers significant advantages in the quality and nature of healthcare delivery in the future. To our knowledge a unified healthcare network like HealthLynked currently does not exist in the market.  



Competitors in our Patient Services division include women’s health, functional medicine, physical therapy practices and day spas throughout southwest Florida.



Competitors in our Medical Distribution division indirectly include large unit-of-measure distributors such as McKesson Corp. and Medline as well as small unit-of-measure distributor Henry Schein offering direct to physician, dental and veterinary practices. We attempt to differentiate MOD’s model from these large distributors by focusing on small unit-of-measure direct to patients and physician practices at competitive pricing.



Government Regulation



The healthcare industry is governed by a framework of federal and state laws, rules and regulations that are extensive and complex and for which, in many cases, the industry has the benefit of only limited judicial and regulatory interpretation. If we are found to have violated these laws, rules, or regulations, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Moreover, healthcare reform continues to attract significant legislative interest, regulatory activity, new approaches, legal challenges, and public attention that create uncertainty and the potential for additional changes. Healthcare reform implementation, additional legislation or regulations, and other changes in government policy or regulation may affect our reimbursement, restrict our existing operations, limit the expansion of our business, or impose additional compliance requirements and costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our common stock.

Health care laws and regulations are rapidly evolving and may change significantly in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the accompanying Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, collectively referred to as the ACA, were enacted. The ACA includes a variety of health care reform provisions and requirements, which became effective at varying times since its enactment and substantially changed the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers. 



In January 2017, President Donald Trump issued an executive order titled “Minimizing the Economic Burden of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Pending Repeal.” The order directed agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, health care providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. In October 2017, President Trump issued a second executive order relating to the ACA titled “Promoting Healthcare Choice and Competition Across the United States,” which further directs federal agencies to modify how the ACA is implemented, and soon after announced the termination of the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the ACA. To date, Congressional efforts to completely repeal and replace the ACA have been unsuccessful. However, the individual mandate for health insurance coverage under the ACA was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law on December 22, 2017. 



Other proposed changes and reforms to the ACA have included, or may include the following: prohibiting the federal government from operating health insurance marketplaces; eliminating the advanced premium tax credits, and cost sharing reductions for low income individuals who purchase their health insurance through the marketplaces; expanding and encouraging the use of private health savings accounts; providing for insurance plans that offer fewer and less extensive health insurance benefits than under the ACA’s essential health benefits package, including broader use of catastrophic coverage plans, or short-term health insurance; establishing and funding high risk pools or reinsurance programs for individuals with chronic or high cost conditions; and allowing insurers to sell insurance across state lines.



Because of the continued uncertainty about the implementation of the ACA, including the timing of and potential for legal challenges, repeal or amendment of that legislation and the future of the health insurance exchanges, we cannot quantify or predict with any certainty the likely impact of the ACA on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.



Licensing and Certification 



Our clinical personnel are subject to numerous federal, state, and local licensing laws and regulations, relating to, among other things, professional credentialing and professional ethics. Penalties for non-compliance with these laws and standards include loss of professional license, civil or criminal fines and penalties, and exclusion from participation in various governmental and other third-party healthcare programs. Our clinical professionals are also subject to state and federal regulation regarding prescribing medication and controlled substances. Every physician who administers, prescribes, or dispenses any controlled substance must be registered with the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”). Additionally, our clinical personnel are required to meet applicable Medicaid and Medicare provider requirements, as set forth under state and federal laws, rules, and regulations. Further, our facilities are also subject to federal, state, and local licensing regulations: we may have to obtain regulatory approval, including certificates of need, before establishing certain types of healthcare facilities, offering certain services, or expending amounts in excess of statutory thresholds for healthcare equipment, facilities or programs. Our ability to operate profitably will depend, in part, upon our ability and the ability of our clinicians and facilities to obtain and maintain all necessary licenses, certifications, accreditations, and other approvals.
Fraud and Abuse Provisions 



Existing federal laws, as well as similar state laws, relating to government-sponsored or funded healthcare programs, or “GHC Programs,” impose a variety of fraud and abuse prohibitions on healthcare companies like us. These laws are interpreted broadly and enforced aggressively by multiple government agencies, including the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and various state agencies. In addition, in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, Congress established a Medicaid Integrity Program to enhance federal and state efforts to detect Medicaid fraud, waste, and abuse and provide financial incentives for states to enact their own false claims legislation as an additional enforcement tool against Medicaid fraud and abuse. Since then, a growing number of states have enacted or expanded healthcare fraud and abuse laws. 



The fraud and abuse provisions include extensive federal and state laws, rules and regulations applicable to us, particularly on the services offered through NWC. In particular, the federal anti-kickback statute has criminal provisions relating to the offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any remuneration in return for either referring Medicaid, Medicare or other GHC Program business, or purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending any service or item for which payment may be made by GHC Programs. In addition, the federal physician self-referral law, commonly known as the “Stark Law,” applies to physician ordering of certain designated health services reimbursable by Medicare from an entity with which the physician has a prohibited financial relationship. These laws are broadly worded and have been broadly interpreted by federal courts, and potentially subject many healthcare business arrangements to government investigation and prosecution, which can be costly and time consuming. Violations of these laws are punishable by substantial penalties, including monetary fines, civil penalties, administrative remedies, criminal sanctions (in the case of the anti-kickback statute), exclusion from participation in GHC Programs and forfeiture of amounts collected in violation of such laws, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

There are a variety of other types of federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including laws authorizing the imposition of criminal, civil and administrative penalties for filing false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement with government healthcare programs. These laws include the civil False Claims Act (“FCA”), which prohibits the submission of, or causing to be submitted, false claims to GHC Programs, including Medicaid, Medicare, TRICARE (the program for military dependents and retirees), the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, and insurance plans purchased through ACA exchanges. Substantial civil fines and multiple damages, along with other remedies, can be imposed for violating the FCA. Furthermore, proving a violation of the FCA requires only that the government show that the individual or company that submitted or caused to be submitted an allegedly false claim acted in “reckless disregard” or in “deliberate ignorance” of the truth or falsity of the claim or with “willful disregard,” notwithstanding that there may have been no specific intent to defraud the government program and no actual knowledge that the claim was false (which typically are required to be shown to sustain a criminal conviction). The FCA also applies to the improper retention of known overpayments and includes “whistleblower” provisions that permit private citizens to sue a claimant on behalf of the government and thereby share in the amounts recovered under the law and to receive additional remedies. In recent years, many cases have been brought against healthcare companies by such “whistleblowers,” which have resulted in judgments or, more often, settlements involving substantial payments to the government by the companies involved. It is anticipated that the number of such actions against healthcare companies will continue to increase with the enactment or enhancement of a growing number of state false claims acts, certain amendments to the FCA and enhanced government enforcement.



Further, HIPAA established a national Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program under the joint direction of the Attorney General and the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), acting through the Inspector General, designed to coordinate federal, state, and local law enforcement activities with respect to health care fraud and abuse. Under HIPAA, a healthcare benefit program includes any private plan or contract affecting interstate commerce under which any medical benefit, item, or service is provided. A person or entity that knowingly and willfully obtains the money or property of any healthcare benefit program by means of false or fraudulent representations in connection with the delivery of healthcare services is subject to a fine or imprisonment, or both. In addition, HIPAA authorizes the imposition of civil money penalties against entities that employ or enter into contracts with excluded Medicare or Medicaid program participants if such entities provide services to federal health program beneficiaries.



In addition, federal and state agencies that administer healthcare programs have at their disposal statutes, commonly known as “civil money penalty laws,” that authorize substantial administrative fines and exclusion from government programs in cases where an individual or company that filed a false claim, or caused a false claim to be filed, knew or should have known that the claim was false or fraudulent. As under the FCA, it often is not necessary for the agency to show that the claimant had actual knowledge that the claim was false or fraudulent in order to impose these penalties.



The civil and administrative false claims statutes are being applied in an increasingly broad range of circumstances. For example, government authorities have asserted that claiming reimbursement for services that fail to meet applicable quality standards may, under certain circumstances, violate these statutes. Government authorities also often take the position, now with support in the FCA, that claims for services that were induced by kickbacks, Stark Law violations or other illicit marketing schemes are fraudulent and, therefore, violate the false claims statutes. Many of the laws and regulations referenced above can be used in conjunction with each other.



If we were excluded from participation in any government-sponsored healthcare programs, not only would we be prohibited from submitting claims for reimbursement under such programs, but we also would be unable to contract with other healthcare providers, such as hospitals, to provide services to them. It could also adversely affect our ability to contract with, or to obtain payment from, non-governmental payors.



Although we intend to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable federal and state fraud and abuse laws, many of the laws, rules and regulations applicable to us, including those relating to billing and those relating to financial relationships with physicians and hospitals, are broadly worded and may be interpreted or applied by prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authorities in ways that we cannot predict. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that our arrangements or business practices will not be subject to government scrutiny or be alleged or found to violate applicable fraud and abuse laws. Moreover, the standards of business conduct expected of healthcare companies under these laws and regulations have become more stringent in recent years, even in instances where there has been no change in statutory or regulatory language. If there is a determination by government authorities that we have not complied with any of these laws, rules and regulations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially, adversely affected.



False or Fraudulent Claim Laws; Medical Billing and Coding



Medical billing, coding and collection activities are governed by numerous federal and state civil and criminal laws, regulations, and sub-regulatory guidance. We provide billing and coding services, claims processing and other solutions to providers that relate to, or directly involve, the reimbursement of health services covered by Medicare, Medicaid, other federal and state healthcare programs and private payers. These services may subject us to, or we may be contractually required to comply with, numerous federal and state laws that prohibit false or fraudulent claims including but not limited to the FCA, the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law (“CMP Law”), and state equivalents. We rely on our customers to provide us with accurate and complete information and to appropriately use the solutions we provide to them, but they may not always do so.

The FCA prohibits the knowing submission of false claims or statements to the federal government, including to the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The FCA defines the term “knowingly” broadly to include not only actual knowledge of a claim’s falsity, but also reckless disregard of the truth of the information, or deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of a claim. Specific intent to defraud is not required. The FCA may be enforced by the federal government directly or by a qui tam plaintiff, or whistleblower, on the government’s behalf. The government may use the FCA to prosecute Medicare and other government program fraud in areas such as coding errors and billing for services not rendered. Further, submission of a claim for an item or service generated in violation of the AKS constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. When an entity is determined to have violated the FCA, it may be required to pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus substantial civil penalties for each false claim, and may be excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs. We rely on our customers to provide us with accurate and complete information and to appropriately use the solutions we provide to them, but they may not always do so.



Government Reimbursement Requirements



In order to participate in the various state Medicaid programs and in the Medicare program, we must comply with stringent and often complex enrollment and reimbursement requirements. Moreover, different states impose differing standards for their Medicaid programs. While we believe that we adhere to the laws, rules and regulations applicable to the government programs in which we participate, any failure to comply with these laws, rules and regulations could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.



In addition, GHC Programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations and determinations, requirements for utilization review and new governmental funding restrictions, all of which may materially increase or decrease program payments, as well as affect the cost of providing services and the timing of payments to providers. Moreover, because these programs generally provide for reimbursement on a fee-schedule basis rather than on a charge-related basis, we generally cannot increase our revenue by increasing the amount we charge for our services. To the extent our costs increase, we may not be able to recover our increased costs from these programs, and cost containment measures and market changes in non-governmental insurance plans have generally restricted our ability to recover, or shift to non-governmental payors, these increased costs. In attempts to limit federal and state spending, there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of proposals to limit or reduce Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement for various services. Our business may be significantly and adversely affected by any such changes in reimbursement policies and other legislative initiatives aimed at reducing healthcare costs associated with Medicaid, Medicare and other government healthcare programs.



Our business also could be adversely affected by reductions in, or limitations of, reimbursement amounts or rates under these government programs, reductions in funding of these programs or elimination of coverage for certain individuals or treatments under these programs.



HIPAA and Other Privacy Laws



Numerous federal and state laws, rules, and regulations govern the collection, dissemination, use, and confidentiality of protected health information, including HIPAA, and its implementing regulations, violations of which are punishable by monetary fines, civil penalties and, in some cases, criminal sanctions. As part of the HealthLynked Network and our medical record keeping, third-party billing and other services, we collect and maintain protected health information on the patients that we serve.



Pursuant to HIPAA, the HHS has adopted standards to protect the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, known as the Privacy Standards and Security Standards. HHS’ Privacy Standards apply to medical records and other individually identifiable health information in any form, whether electronic, paper or oral, that is used or disclosed by healthcare providers, hospitals, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, which are known as “covered entities.” HHS’ Security Standards require healthcare providers to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the integrity, confidentiality and availability of individually identifiable health information that is electronically received, maintained or transmitted (including between us and our affiliated practices). To the extent permitted by applicable privacy regulations and contracts and associated Business Associate Agreements with our customers, we are permitted to use and disclose protected health information to perform our services and for other limited purposes, but other uses and disclosures, such as marketing communications, require written authorization from the patient or must meet an exception specified under the privacy regulations In addition, with respect to our managed physician practices, the HIPAA administrative simplification provisions require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards of healthcare claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically. Further, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (“HITECH”) strengthened and expanded HIPAA, increased penalties for violations, gave patients new rights to restrict uses and disclosures of their health information, and imposed a number of privacy and security requirements directly on business associates that perform functions or services on behalf of covered entities. Specifically, HITECH requires that covered entities report any unauthorized use or disclosure of protected health information that meets the definition of a “breach” to the affected individuals. In addition, HITECH requires that business associates report breaches to their covered entity customers. HITECH also authorizes state Attorneys General to bring civil actions in response to violations of HIPAA that threaten the privacy of state residents. Final regulations implementing the HITECH requirements were issued in January 2013.

To the extent we are permitted under our customer contracts, we may de-identify protected health information and use de-identified information for our purposes without obtaining patient authorization or further complying with HIPAA. Determining whether protected health information has been sufficiently de-identified to comply with the HIPAA privacy standards and our contractual obligations may require complex factual and statistical analyses. Any failure by us to meet HIPAA requirements with respect to de-identification could subject us to penalties. 



In addition to the federal HIPAA and HITECH requirements, numerous other state and certain other federal laws protect the confidentiality of patient information, including state medical privacy laws, state social security number protection laws, state genetic privacy laws, human subjects research laws and federal and state consumer protection laws. These state laws govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to and confidentiality of patient information. In many cases, state laws are more restrictive than, and not preempted by, HIPAA, and may allow personal rights of action with respect to privacy or security breaches, as well as fines. State laws are contributing to increased enforcement activity and are also subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities. 



Data Protection and Breaches



Most states require holders of personal information to maintain safeguards, and all states have laws that require take certain actions in response to a data breach, such as providing prompt notification of the breach to affected individuals or the state’s attorney general. In some states, these laws are limited to electronic data, but states increasingly are enacting or considering stricter and broader requirements. The laws are inconsistent across states, which can increase the costs of compliance. Additionally, HIPAA imposes certain notification requirements on Business Associates. In certain circumstances involving large breaches, media notice is required requirements may even involve notification to the media. A non-permitted use or disclosure of protected health information is presumed to be a breach under HIPAA unless the Business Associate or covered entity establishes that there is a low probability the information has been compromised consistent with the risk assessment requirements enumerated in HIPAA. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission uses its consumer protection authority to initiate enforcement actions in response to data breaches.
Compliance Programs



Organizations that receive reimbursement from a federal or state government payor are expected by the federal government to have a compliance program. Specifically, compliance programs are integral to identifying and rectifying fraud and abuse risk areas, billing and coding violations, and educating employees about the law and other legal requirements or restrictions within the scope of their practice. We maintain a program to monitor compliance with federal and state laws and regulations applicable to healthcare entities. We believe that our compliance program meets the relevant standards provided by the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services.
Environmental Regulations



Our healthcare operations generate medical waste that must be disposed of in compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations. Our office-based operations are subject to compliance with various other environmental laws, rules and regulations. Such compliance does not, and we anticipate that such compliance will not, materially affect our capital expenditures, financial position or results of operations.
Fair Debt Collection Practices Act



Some of our operations may be subject to compliance with certain provisions of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and comparable state laws. Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, a third-party collection company is restricted in the methods it uses to contact consumer debtors and elicit payments with respect to placed accounts. Requirements under state collection agency statutes vary, with most requiring compliance similar to that required under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Florida’s Consumer Collection Practices Act is broader than the federal legislation, applying the regulations to “creditors” as well as “collectors,” whereas the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act is applicable only to collectors. This prohibits creditors who are attempting to collect their own debts from engaging in behavior prohibited by the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and Consumer Collection Practices Act. The Consumer Collection Practices Act has very specific guidelines regarding which actions debt collectors and creditors may engage in to collect unpaid debt.
Government Investigations



We expect that audits, inquiries and investigations from government authorities, agencies, contractors and payors will occur in the ordinary course of business. Such audits, inquiries and investigations and their ultimate resolutions, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our common stock.
