Item 1. Description of Business.
Overview
 
Inhibitor Therapeutics, Inc. is a pharmaceutical development company that is focused on developing and ultimately commercializing innovative therapeutics for patients with certain cancers and certain non-cancerous proliferation disorders. We have also explored and expect to continue to explore acquiring or licensing other innovative preclinical and clinical stage therapeutics addressing unmet needs and orphan indications beyond cancer. While the Company is not presently conducting research and development activities with respect to its currently in-licensed technologies and its own intellectual property as a result of recently settled litigations involving the Company, the Company expects to continue to explore acquiring or licensing innovative preclinical and clinical stage therapeutics following the recent litigation settlement.
 
On September 15, 2022, Hedgepath, LLC (“HPLLC”), a significant minority stockholder of the Company, filed a civil action in the Delaware Court of Chancery (the “Court”) captioned Hedgepath, LLC v. Magrab, et al., C.A. No. 2019-0529-JTL (the “Action”) against certain of the Company’s current and former directors, and its President and Chief Executive Officer (the “Individual Defendants”), as well as the Company’s majority stockholder, Mayne Pharma Ventures Pty Ltd. (“Mayne Pharma”, and collectively with the Individual Defendants, the “Defendants”). The Company was named as a nominal defendant given the derivative nature of the claims. On December 3, 2019, HPLLC filed its Verified Amended and Supplemental Complaint (the “Complaint”). The Complaint asserts various claims, either directly on behalf of HPLLC or derivatively on behalf of the Company, for alleged breaches of fiduciary duty, violation of Delaware statute, waste, fraudulent misrepresentation, declaratory judgment, and dilution of stockholder equity arising out of transactions previously entered into between the Company and Mayne Pharma and Mayne Pharma’s relationship with the Company generally. The Complaint seeks unspecified damages and other relief. Additionally, on March 23, 2020, a Stockholder Class Action Complaint was filed in the Court by Company stockholder and purported class representative Samuel P. Sears purportedly on behalf of a class of certain holders of the Company’s common stock. That lawsuit, captioned Sears v. Magrab et al., C.A. No. 2020-0215-JTL (the “Putative Class Action”), asserts claims against the same Defendants (with the exception of the Company), and the facts underlying the claims largely mirror those alleged in the Action. On December 10, 2020, the Court entered a stipulated Order coordinating the Action and the Putative Class Action (together, the “Coordinated Actions”).
 
On September 9, 2022, HPLLC, Sears, the Company, the Individual Defendants and Mayne Pharma entered into a Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise, Settlement, and Release, dated and filed with the Court (together with the exhibits thereto, the “Settlement Agreement”), which the Court approved, and the Settlement Agreement went into effect on December 13, 2022 (the “Effective Date”).
 
Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, (i) the Defendants will cause $14,250,000 in cash (to be funded via Mayne Pharma’s director and officer insurance) to be paid to the Company (the “Cash Consideration”); (ii) Mayne Pharma will surrender all equity securities in the Company for cancellation, and will forgive certain debts it is owed by the Company; (iii) stock options and warrants held by the Individual Defendants will be cancelled; (iv) certain intellectual property licenses to and from the Company, on one hand, and Mayne Pharma, on the other, will be converted or terminated, with only certain obligations remaining in place; (v) each of the Individual Defendants will retire from their positions with the Company, including as members of the Company’s Board of Directors and management; (vi) the Third Amended and Restated Supply and License Agreement, dated December 17, 2018, between the Company and Mayne will be cancelled, with the Company retaining a royalty on future net sales of SUBA-Itraconazole BCCNS in the United States subject to certain contingent payment obligations; and (vii) various releases will be exchanged among the parties to the Coordinated Actions. After the Effective Date, Mayne Pharma has also agreed it will remain amenable to discussing with the Company, in good faith, the potential licensing and/or sub- licensing of the JHU Patents (as defined in the Settlement Agreement), for a commercially reasonable licensing fee, to the extent the Company seeks to engage in such discussions and that it will not take the position that the Company or persons affiliated with the Company, including Dr. Francis E. O’Donnell, Jr., are prohibited from developing or commercializing Non-SUBA Formulations of Itraconazole for any cancer or non-cancer indications. Nor shall Mayne Pharma take any action intended to restrict or limit the Company’s ability or efforts to develop or commercialize Non- SUBA Formulations of Itraconazole for any cancer or non-cancer indications.
 
Upon approval by the Court, the Coordinate Actions were deemed fully resolved and all asserted claims were dismissed with prejudice on the Effective Date.

On December 10, 2022, and in furtherance of the transactions contemplated by the Settlement Agreement, W. Mark Watson, Stefan J. Cross, Dr. R. Dana Ono, and Robert D. Martin (collectively, the “Resigning Directors”) gave notice of the Company of their resignation from the Board to be effective on December 13, 2022. The purpose of resignation of the Resigning Directors is in relation to the Settlement Agreement and not based on any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company’s operations, policies, or practices. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the stock options and warrants held by the Resigning Directors were cancelled.
 
On December 10, 2022, and in furtherance of the transactions contemplated by the Settlement Agreement, Nicholas J. Virca and Garrison J. Hasara (collectively, the “Resigning Officers”) gave notice of the Company of their resignation from their officer positions to be effective on December 13, 2022. The purpose of resignation of the Resigning Officers is in relation to the Settlement Agreement and not based on any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company’s operations, policies, or practices. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the stock options and warrants held by the Resigning Officers were cancelled.
 
The new Board and management of INTI intend to continue the development of itraconazole for BCCNS, and other cancers and non-cancerous proliferative disorders. To that end, the development or acquisition of its own proprietary and patent-protected formulation of itraconazole is anticipated. In addition, the Company is exploring the addition of other product candidates that meet our strict criteria: products that target an unmet medical need of significant clinical value, and are patent protected, and that qualify for the 505(b)2 regulatory pathway.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We strive to protect the intellectual property that we believe will be important to our business, including seeking our own patent protection (or seeking licenses to patents) intended to cover the composition of matter of our product candidates, their methods of use, related technology and other inventions that are important to our business.
 
We have developed, licensed, optioned to license, and are seeking to acquire and/or license, intellectual property and know-how related to the treatment of cancer patients using itraconazole-based compounds.
 
The following is a summary of intellectual property in the form of issued U.S. patents we own, or for which we have exclusive licenses, regarding the use of itraconazole, and more specifically SUBA-Itraconazole, as an anti-cancer therapy.

We also plan to continue to expand our intellectual property estate and are filing additional patent applications directed to dosage forms, methods of treatment, therapies for other cancers and additional Hedgehog inhibitor compounds and their derivatives. We will also rely on trade secrets and careful monitoring of our proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
 
The Company and Mayne entered into a license agreement (the “License Agreement”) pursuant to which the Company grants Mayne a worldwide, royalty-free, nonexclusive, perpetual, irrevocable license to certain of the Company’s Patents (as defined in the License Agreement) to the extent they relate to or have potential application in connection with the Product (as defined in the License Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company has retained a royalty on future net sales of SUBA-Itraconazole BCCNS in the United States, subject to credit for previously paid advances of $3,000,000 by Mayne, after which any further royalty payments due to the Company will be paid in full.

The Hedgehog Pathway
 
Based on the results of physician-sponsored studies conducted by others (including in vitro, animal, and human studies), we believe that itraconazole affects the Hedgehog signaling pathway in cells, which in turn impacts the development and growth of certain cancers. The studies, conducted at prominent medical institutions, primarily in the United States, were published in the Journal of Thoracic Oncology, The Oncologist and the Journal of Clinical Oncology between May 2013 and February 2014. Based on these studies, it appears that itraconazole has notable anti-cancer effects by one or more independent or synergistic mechanisms, some of which are not clearly understood and will continue to be the subject of ongoing research. These studies, and our own work in the clinic, formed the basis of our continued interest in the clinical development of itraconazole for treatment of human cancers.
 
The Hedgehog signaling pathway is a major regulator of many fundamental cellular processes in vertebrates, including primarily at the embryonic stage of development but also as it relates to stem cell maintenance, cell differentiation, tissue polarity and cell proliferation. Based on published research and our experience in human testing, we believe that inhibiting the Hedgehog pathway can delay or possibly prevent the development of certain cancers in patients. Research has shown that activation of the Hedgehog pathway can lead to the formation of cancerous tumors (a process known as tumorigenesis) such as the most common form of skin cancer known as basal cell carcinoma. A variety of other human cancers, including brain, gastrointestinal, lung, breast and prostate cancers, also demonstrate inappropriate activation of this pathway. Hedgehog signaling from the tumor to the surrounding cell structures has been shown to sometimes promote further tumorigenesis as well. This pathway has also been shown to regulate proliferation of cancer stem cells and to increase tumor invasiveness.
 
We believe that the targeted inhibition of Hedgehog signaling is or may be effective in the treatment and prevention of many types of human cancers. We also believe that the discovery and synthesis of specific Hedgehog pathway inhibitors may have significant clinical implications regarding the development of novel cancer therapies. Several synthetic Hedgehog antagonists are now being studied, some of which are undergoing clinical evaluation. The orally available compound, Erivedge®, vismodegib, developed by Curis and sold to Genentech, Inc. (a subsidiary of Roche), was the first Hedgehog inhibitor based therapy and Odomzo®, sonidegib (developed by Novartis and sold to Sun Pharma in 2015 by Novartis) is the second orally available compound, that has been approved for treatment of advanced stages of basal cell carcinoma by the FDA. Most recently, in 2018, Daurismo®, glasdegib oral capsules developed by Pfizer, was approved by FDA for use in combination with low dose cytarabine for patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML), aged 75 or older who are too frail to be treated with intensive chemotherapy.
 
Repurposing Itraconazole for Treating Cancer
 
We are implementing clinical and regulatory plans to enable the repurposing of itraconazole. This strategy is intended to significantly reduce the risk and time to potential FDA approvals for marketing in the United States.
 
Itraconazole appears to have notable anti-cancer effects by one or more independent or synergistic mechanisms, some of which are not clearly understood and continue to be the subject of ongoing research. These anti-cancer effects have been demonstrated in various animal models and, subsequently in human studies over the last several years.
 
In animal models, itraconazole has also demonstrated an anti-angiogenic effect (i.e., inhibiting the formation of new blood vessels), which may be important in controlling the proliferation of cancerous cells and tumors in humans based upon its interaction with certain cell-based growth factors. Itraconazole also appears to induce changes related to the mTOR pathway, an important regulator of cell growth, proliferation and survival which, when unregulated, can also lead to cancer. These effects have been demonstrated in a physician-based study conducted to test the effects of itraconazole on late-stage lung cancer.
 
Prostate Cancer
 
Itraconazole has already been tested as a treatment for men with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (“mCRPC”) in a multi-institutional Phase 2 trial completed in 2011 and led by Johns Hopkins University which was published in 2013. This study showed that, at a specified dose, there was a significant correlation to slowing the progression of cancer and extending survival.

Lung Cancer
 
Physicians treating patients with advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”), most often caused by cigarette smoking have a variety of options when considering therapies to extend survival, particularly based upon recent approvals of immunotherapies, known as checkpoint inhibitors for PD-L1 (programmed death ligand 1) such as Keytruda®, pembrolizumab marketed by Merck and approved by FDA in 2017 and potentially useful in about 25% of patients. However, if patients are not candidates for immunotherapy based on genetic marker testing (PD-L1 positive) or do not have mutations for EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor, 15% of patients), ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase, 3-5% of patients), ROS1 (c-ros oncogene 1, 1-2% of patients) or BRAF (proto-oncogene B-Raf, 1-3% of patients) in order to be treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, they will be given chemotherapy, in particular platinum based doublet therapy with pemetrexed (Alimta®).With a median survival of only 8-10 months while on these approved chemotherapy regimens, we believe that new therapies for these patients are needed. We believe that the pre-clinical data and reported human data between 2011 and 2018 on the use of itraconazole in conjunction with chemotherapy reflects positively on the use of itraconazole as an anti-cancer therapy for this form of lung cancer in patients who do not present with markers that enable their treatment with the agents mentioned above. If these data prove to be applicable to human treatment by improving survival, while dosing Itraconazole in combination with chemotherapy therapy (the combination of platinum-based chemotherapy drugs in conjunction with pemetrexed), the treatment may qualify for one or more FDA accelerated programs, such as a breakthrough therapy or fast track status.
 
Our goals for Itraconazole for the treatment of NSCLC are (assuming we obtain adequate funding) to prepare for a pre-IND Meeting Request with FDA, which could lead to the filing of an IND for this indication, which in turn would allow us to undertake a second clinical study in addition to our SUBA-Itraconazole Prostate Program.
 
Basal Cell Carcinoma
 
Utilizing SUBA-Itraconazole to treat BCC in patients with Gorlin Syndrome was the first indication that we studied in a Phase 2b trial which was launched in August of 2015. We began recruiting and dosing subjects during the fourth quarter of 2015, and we completed enrollment in the fourth quarter of 2017. Individuals who were enrolled in this trial must have been diagnosed with Gorlin Syndrome and had numerous BCC tumors as well as met well-defined inclusion criteria in order to qualify for enrollment and treatment with SUBA-Itraconazole (the patented formulation of itraconazole owned by Mayne Pharma).
 
Gorlin Syndrome is caused by a mutation in a gene called PTCH1. This mutation causes PTCH to lose its ability to inhibit SMO (a protein receptor of the Hedgehog pathway) which controls Hedgehog Pathway signaling. With SMO not being inhibited, BCCNS patients develop multiple BCC tumors over weeks, months and years on a continued basis. SUBA-Itraconazole is therefore being tested to study its ability to bind to SMO (itraconazole has demonstrated SMO binding in animal and human studies), thus inhibiting Hedgehog pathway activity which leads to the formation of the BCC tumors in these patients. The key objective of our Phase 2b trial was to demonstrate patient benefit by reducing tumor burden that requires on-going intervention for tumor growth via surgery and/or use of more toxic Hedgehog inhibitor therapies. After the Company completed the phase 2b study on 447 distinct basal cell carcinomas demonstrating an ORR in over 50% of these basal cell carcinomas, Mayne Pharma assumed control of the SUBA-Itraconazole BCCNS program in December 2018 in exchange for (among other consideration) a 9% quarterly cash royalty on future net sales, if any, of SUBA-Itraconazole BCCNS in the United States. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions” for further information. To the best of the Company’s knowledge, Mayne Pharma has discontinued its development efforts of SUBA itraconazole for BCCNS and the Company is unaware of any plans for its future development by Mayne. The aforementioned settlement agreement provides INTI with the right to pursue development or licensure of an itraconazole formulation for any indication and the right to pursue a license to the JHU patents.
 
Our Potential Market
 
The following table depicts our current estimate of the total available market opportunity for our proposed anti-cancer therapies based upon independent market research, scientific and industry publications, and management’s knowledge of the U.S. oncology market. Our estimates (including estimated product pricing) are based on assumptions and are subject to change.

Our Strategy
 
Our goal is to be a leader in the development and commercialization of itraconazole-based therapeutics for the treatment of cancer patients and patients with non-cancerous proliferation disorders, assuming in all cases that we obtain sufficient funding to recommence and thereafter continue our operations. We believe that we can accomplish this goal by implementing the following key elements of our business strategy:

● | Seek FDA Programs to Expedite Drug Approvals. The FDA has various programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions. These expedited programs help ensure that therapies for serious conditions are available as soon as it can be concluded that the therapies’ benefits justify their risks, taking into account the seriousness of the condition and the availability of alternative treatments. These programs include breakthrough therapy designation, fast track designation, accelerated approval, and priority review. We believe that SUBA-Itraconazole for the treatment of cancer may qualify for one or more of these designations, which could help expedite the regulatory review process. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Commercialize and Market with Exclusivity. We are developing specific clinical trial designs to address different forms of cancer and non-cancerous proliferation disorders in order to pursue FDA approvals for multiple indications. Further, we believe SUBA-Itraconazole can be commercialized in a way that maximizes benefits for patients, based on our specific therapy regimens, while eliminating generic substitution and providing us with market exclusivity protections through our intellectual property rights. 

 
In addition, we have explored and expect to continue to explore acquiring or licensing other innovative pre-clinical and clinical stage therapeutics addressing unmet needs and orphan indications for the treatment of cancer and other diseases.
 
We have and expect to continue to finance our research and development, commercialization and distribution efforts and our working capital needs primarily through:
 

● | proceeds from public and private financings and, potentially, from other strategic transactions (including potential royalty-related financing transactions) although our attempts over the last four years to secure such financing have not been successful, due to, among other factors, our prior litigation (finalized in December 2022) and the lack of market liquidity for our common stock; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | potential partnerships with other pharmaceutical companies to assist in the supply, manufacturing and distribution of our products for which we would expect to receive milestone and royalty payments; 
● | potential licensing and joint venture arrangements with third parties, including other pharmaceutical companies where we would receive funding based on out-licensing our product; and/or 
● | government or private foundation grants or loans which would be awarded to us to further develop our current and future anti-cancer therapies. 

 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, our only source of financial liquidity as of the date of this Report is the cash on hand realized from the net proceeds of the payment required pursuant to the Mayne Settlement
 
Background on Cancer
 
Cancer is a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled cell division and growth. Cancerous cells that arise in the lymphatic system and bone marrow are referred to as hematological tumors. Cancer cells that arise in other tissues or organs are referred to as solid tumors. Researchers believe that exposure to some chemicals, viruses and various forms of radiation can cause genetic alterations that cause cancer. Genetic predispositions also can increase the risk of cancer in some people.
 
Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, exceeded only by heart disease. The American Cancer Society reported that an estimated total of approximately 1.9 million new cancer cases diagnosed and approximately 609,000 deaths occurred in the United States in 2022.

The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy. A cancer patient often receives treatment with a combination of these methods. Surgery and radiation therapy are particularly effective in patients in whom the disease is localized (not spread beyond the initial site of disease). Physicians generally use systemic drug therapies in situations in which the cancer has spread beyond the primary site or cannot otherwise be treated through surgery. The goal of drug therapy is to damage and kill cancer cells or to interfere with the molecular and cellular processes that control the development, growth and survival of cancer cells or tumors. In many cases, drug therapy entails the administration of several different drugs in combination. Over the past several decades, drug therapy has evolved from non-specific drugs that damage both healthy and cancerous cells, to drugs that target specific molecular pathways involved in cancer and more recently to therapeutics that target the specific oncogenic “drivers” of cancer.
 
Cytotoxic Chemotherapies. The earliest approach to pharmacological cancer treatment was to develop drugs, referred to as cytotoxic drugs, which kill rapidly proliferating cancer cells through non-specific mechanisms, such as disrupting cell metabolism or causing damage to cellular components required for survival and rapid growth. While these kinds of drugs have been effective in the treatment of some cancers, many unmet medical needs for the treatment of cancer remain. Also, cytotoxic drug therapies act in an indiscriminate manner, acting upon the metabolism of healthy as well as cancerous cells. Due to their mechanism of action, many cytotoxic drugs have a narrow dose range above which the toxicity causes unacceptable or even fatal levels of damage and below which the drugs are not effective in eradicating cancer cells.
 
Targeted Therapies. The next approach to pharmacological cancer treatment was to develop drugs, referred to as targeted therapeutics, that target specific biological molecules in the human body that play a role in rapid cell growth and the spread of cancer. Targeted therapeutics include vascular disruptors, also referred to as angiogenesis inhibitors, which prevent the formation of new blood vessels and restrict a tumor’s blood supply. Other targeted therapies affect cellular signaling pathways that are critical for the growth of cancer. While these drugs have been effective in the treatment of some cancers, most do not address the underlying cause of the disease. These drugs focus on inhibiting processes that help the cancer cell survive, but not the oncogenes that are the drivers or cause of the cancer itself.
 
Oncogenic Therapies. A more recent approach to pharmacological cancer treatment is to develop drugs that affect the drivers that cause uncontrolled growth of cancer cells because of a specific genetic alteration. In some cases, these agents were identified as therapeutics without knowledge of the underlying genetic change causing the disease. To date, the shortcoming of this research approach has been that it often follows a conventional trial and error approach to drug discovery. In this approach, clinical development involves the treatment of large populations from which a defined subpopulation that responds to treatment is identified. As a result, this approach can be time-consuming and costly, with success often uncertain. Another major concern of these newly discovered drugs, some of which have been recently approved, is that resistance to them occurs as the cancer finds new ways to circumvent the genetic pathway.
 
Immunotherapies. Immunotherapy is the use of medicines to stimulate a person’s own immune system to recognize and destroy cancer cells more effectively. Immunotherapy can be used to treat many different types of cancer, including lung cancer, melanoma, renal, liver, cervical and gastric cancers. An important part of the immune system is its ability to keep itself from attacking normal cells in the body. To do this, it uses “checkpoints” – molecules on immune cells that need to be turned on (or off) to start an immune response. Cancer cells sometimes use these checkpoints to avoid being attacked by the immune system. But newer drugs that target these checkpoints are demonstrating a lot of promise as cancer treatments. These drugs target PD-1, a protein on immune system T cells that normally helps keep these cells from attacking other cells in the body. By blocking PD-1, these drugs boost the immune response against cancer cells. This can shrink many types of tumors or slow their growth. The new drugs can also target PD-L1, a protein related to PD-1 that is found on some tumor cells and immune cells. Blocking this protein can also help boost the immune response against cancer cells. These drugs can be used in people with certain types of cancer which starts growing again after chemotherapy or other drug treatments. They are also used as a first treatment (instead of chemo) in some people and are given as an intravenous (IV) infusion every 2 or 3 weeks.
 
The Itraconazole Approach to Treating Cancer
 
We are focusing our developments on Hedgehog pathway inhibitor therapeutics for patients with certain cancers.
 
Background of Itraconazole. Itraconazole is FDA approved for and used to treat serious fungal or yeast infections. This medicine works by killing the fungus or yeast and preventing its growth. Itraconazole is a prescription-based medication, available as an IV solution, oral liquid, capsule or tablet.

Cancer and Hedgehog Inhibitors. The Hedgehog (also known as Hh) proteins comprise a group of secreted proteins that regulate cell growth, differentiation and survival. They are involved in organogenesis (the formation of organs) and have been shown to promote adult stem cell proliferation. Inappropriate activation of the Hh signaling pathway has been implicated in the development of several types of cancers including prostate, lung, pancreas, breast, brain and skin. Hedgehog pathway inhibitors are a relatively new class of therapeutic agents that act by targeting the proteins involved in the regulation of the Hh pathway. Many of these newly discovered inhibitors are currently undergoing preclinical testing and some have entered clinical studies as anti-cancer agents for a variety of cancers. Vismodegib was approved for treatment of locally advanced and metastatic basal cell carcinoma in early 2012, sonidegib was approved for locally advanced BCC in mid-2015 and glasdegib was approved in late 2018 for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.
 
Similarly, itraconazole has also been shown to suppress growth of brain tumors in animal models. It has also been shown to have anti-cancer effects in basal cell carcinoma, lung cancer and prostate cancer in human clinical trials. Itraconazole acts as a SMO (a protein receptor of the Hh pathway) antagonist (blocker), in a manner distinct from its anti-fungal activity which targets a compound found in fungi and yeast known as ergosterol (a steroid found in the cell walls of fungi and yeast that functions in a fashion similar to cholesterol in humans) as well as having anti-angiogenic properties.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We are currently a pharmaceutical development company with no FDA approved products, and thus have not yet established a sales, marketing or product distribution infrastructure because our product candidates are still in development. We may either license commercialization rights to our product candidate to larger third-party partners, who will be responsible for sales, distribution and marketing efforts, or we may (assuming adequate resources are available) retain commercial rights for our product candidates, in which case we would seek to access the oncology market through a focused, specialized sales force of our own or in conjunction with a marketing partner under a co-promotion agreement.
Competition
 
The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and substantial regulatory and technological changes, particularly in the oncology field. Developments by others may render our itraconazole therapies, or any proposed product candidates and formulations under development, non-competitive or obsolete, or we may be unable to keep pace with anti-cancer therapy developments or other market factors. Anti-cancer therapy competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities, governmental entities and others diversifying into the field is intense and is expected to increase.

Government Regulation and Product Approval
 
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export of pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
United States Government Regulation
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
 
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 

● | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP regulations; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | submission to the FDA of an IND application which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
● | approval by an independent institutional review board (or IRB) at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated; 
● | performance of human clinical trials, including adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication; 
● | submission to the FDA of an NDA; 
● | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; 
● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices (of cGMP) and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity, as well as satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of selected clinical sites to determine GCP compliance; and 
● | FDA review and approval of the NDA.

Preclinical Studies. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity, and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
 
We successfully avoided pre-clinical studies or any Phase 1 studies to demonstrate safety based on the fact that itraconazole has an established history of safe and effective use in humans for anti-fungal indications and the fact that human data are already available and published regarding use of itraconazole in humans for anti-cancer indications, such as basal cell carcinoma, lung cancer and prostate cancer.
 
Clinical Trials. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website.
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined. In Phase 1, the drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an initial indication of its effectiveness. In Phase 2, the drug typically is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. In Phase 3, the drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.

--


Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 
Marketing Approval. Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals regarding the timing of its review of an application.
 
The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) plan to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. We believe that a REMS program, which includes intellectual property related to SUBA-Itraconazole and itraconazole, and the specific use of SUBA-Itraconazole for anti-cancer indications, may likely provide additional protection of our proposed therapies from generic substitution.
 
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.
 
The FDA typically refers a question regarding a novel drug to an external advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP.
 
After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, including a boxed warning, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS (Risk Evaluation Mitigation Strategy) which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.

Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs. The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, accelerated approval, priority review and breakthrough designation, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures. To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors.
 
The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. These six and ten-month review periods are measured from the “filing” date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. Most products that are eligible for fast track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review.
 
In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures.
 
Moreover, under the provisions of the new Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, enacted in 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
 
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We believe that we may qualify for one or more of these expedited approvals since our itraconazole anti-cancer therapies offer significant improvements in therapy for all of our targeted anti-cancer indications should they be approved by FDA.
 
Post-Approval Requirements. Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-NDA analyses, such as overall survival (OS) or post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market.

Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 
● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 
● | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 
● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

 
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Although physicians, in the practice of medicine, may prescribe approved drugs for unapproved indications, pharmaceutical companies generally are required to promote their drug products only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (or PDMA), which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
 
Federal and State Fraud and Abuse and Data Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations. In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state fraud and abuse laws restrict business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. These laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws and regulations as well as data privacy and security laws and regulations.
 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated.
 
The reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute was also broadened by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (which we refer to collectively as the PPACA), which, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. PPACA also created new federal requirements for reporting, by applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, payments, and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals.

The federal False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (or HIPAA) created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
 
In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act (or HITECH) and its implementing regulations, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 
Coverage and Reimbursement. The commercial success of our product candidate and our ability to commercialize any approved product candidate will depend in part on the extent to which governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for our therapeutic product candidates and related companion diagnostics. Government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations generally decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels for healthcare. In particular, in the United States, private health insurers and other third-party payors often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government (through the Medicare or Medicaid programs) provides reimbursement for such treatments. In the United States, government authorities and third-party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which often has resulted in average selling prices lower than they would otherwise be. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general.
 
Third-party payors are increasingly imposing additional requirements and restrictions on coverage and limiting reimbursement levels for medical products. For example, federal and state governments reimburse covered prescription drugs at varying rates generally below average wholesale price. These restrictions and limitations influence the purchase of healthcare services and products. Legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce costs under government insurance programs may result in lower reimbursement for our products and product candidates or exclusion of our products and product candidates from coverage. The cost containment measures that healthcare payors and providers are instituting and any healthcare reform could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of any approved product candidates. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain and maintain third-party coverage or adequate reimbursement for our product candidate in whole or in part.

Impact of Healthcare Reform on Coverage, Reimbursement, and Pricing. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (or MMA) imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both standalone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our future products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from Medicare Part D may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
 
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. A plan for the research will be developed by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of any product, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. If third-party payors do not consider our product candidates to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our product candidates, once approved, as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
 
The United States is considering enacting or has enacted a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives, including, most recently, PPACA, which became law in March 2010 and substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among other cost containment measures, the PPACA establishes an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program; and a new formula that increases the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. In the future, there may continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. healthcare system, some of which could further limit the prices we are able to charge for our product candidates, once approved, or the amounts of reimbursement available for our product candidates once they are approved.
 
Exclusivity and Approval of Competing Products
 
Hatch-Waxman Patent Exclusivity. In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or a method of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application (or ANDA), or a 505(b)(2) NDA.
 
Generally, an ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths, dosage form and route of administration as the listed drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent through in vitro or in vivo testing or otherwise to the listed drug. ANDA applicants are not required to conduct or submit results of preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product, other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug, and these drugs can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug. 505(b)(2) NDAs generally are submitted for changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form or indication. The 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway appears to be available for our proposed application of itraconazole as an anti-cancer therapy based upon our communications with FDA to date.
 

17
--


The ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:
 

● | the required patent information has not been filed; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the listed patent has expired; 
● | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or 
● | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by the new product. 

 
Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except when the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed drug. A certification that the proposed product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
 
If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of notice of the Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 
Hatch-Waxman Non-Patent Exclusivity. Market and data exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications for competing products. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the activity of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept an ANDA for review or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that contains the previously approved active moiety. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement.
 
The FDC also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA or 505(b)(2) NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant, are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application or supplement. Three-year exclusivity may be awarded for changes to a previously approved drug product, such as new indications, dosages, strengths or dosage forms of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and, as a general matter, does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic versions of the original, unmodified drug product. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 
Orphan Drug Exclusivity. The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for the development of drugs intended to treat rare diseases or conditions, which generally are diseases or conditions affecting less than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States. If a sponsor demonstrates that a drug is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, the FDA grants orphan drug designation to the product for that use. The benefits of orphan drug designation include research and development tax credits and exemption from user fees. A drug that is approved for the orphan drug designated indication is granted seven years of orphan drug exclusivity. During that period, the FDA generally may not approve any other application for the same product for the same indication, although there are exceptions, most notably when the later product is shown to be clinically superior to the product with exclusivity. We obtained orphan drug designation for SUBA-Itraconazole BCCNS in May 2016.

Foreign Regulation. Although it is not presently our intention to seek approval of our product candidates outside of the United States, in the future we may do so, either directly or in conjunction with a marketing partner. In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. We do however intend to include sites outside the United States for our clinical trials in order to be able to recruit more patients for testing at a greater number of locations and in less time than if we were to focus only on US-based sites. For example, in the European Union, we would need to obtain authorization of a clinical trial application in each member state in which we intend to conduct a clinical trial. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
 
Human Capital Resources
 
As of the date of this Report, we have three full-time employees and three part-time employees. The full-time employees include our Executive Chairman who is involved in our clinical development program history and status, and vetting additional opportunities and operations and the part-time employees include our Interim CFO, administrative support, and accounting. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. From time to time, we also employ independent contractors to support our clinical development and administrative functions. We consider the number of our employees, their compensation, and their functions to be appropriate for the current status of our business, and we also consider relations with each of our employees to be good. Each of our employees has entered into confidentiality, intellectual property assignment and non-competition agreements with us.
Corporate History
 
We were founded under the name “Commonwealth Biotechnologies, Inc.” in Virginia in 1992, and completed an initial public offering in October 1997 (we refer to our company prior to our emergence from bankruptcy as CBI). CBI previously provided, on a contract basis, specialized life sciences services to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sector. On January 20, 2011, CBI filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy. We recommenced our business operations in August 2013 as a Delaware corporation following the emergence of CBI from its voluntary bankruptcy.
