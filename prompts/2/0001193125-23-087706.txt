ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Overview 
 We are a blank check company incorporated on February 23, 2021 as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. We were initially incorporated under the name BH3 Acquisition Corp. and subsequently changed our name to Crixus BH3 Acquisition Company on July 21, 2021. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination (the “Business Combination”) using cash from the proceeds of the initial public offering and the private placement of the private placement warrants (after giving effect to the early redemptions effected in connection with our special meeting), our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt. 
 Our registration statement for the initial public offering was declared effective on October 4, 2021. On October 7, 2021, we consummated the initial public offering of 23,000,000 Units (the “Units”), which included the full exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option, at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $230,000,000, and incurring offering costs of approximately $22.4 million. 
 Simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering on October 7, 2021, we consummated the sale in a private placement (the “Private Placement”) of an aggregate of 6,400,000 Private Placement Warrants at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant to our Sponsor, generating proceeds of $9,600,000. 
 Our initial stockholders (including our anchor investors) currently hold 5,750,000 founder shares. The founder shares will automatically convert into shares of our Class A common stock on the first business day following the completion of our initial business combination. Prior to our initial business combination, only holders of founder shares will be entitled to vote on the election of directors. 
 Our anchor investors purchased an aggregate of approximately 22,980,000 units in the initial public offering at the public offering price of $10.00. No anchor investor purchased more than 9.9% of the units offered. Upon the closing our initial public offering, our anchor investors owned, in the aggregate, approximately 79.9% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. In consideration of those purchases, our sponsor entered into an investment agreement with each of the anchor investors pursuant to which our sponsor sold an aggregate of 1,450,758 founder shares, at the original purchase price of approximately $0.004 per share. 
 Upon the closing of the initial public offering and the Private Placement, $232,300,000 ($10.10 per Unit) of the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the initial public offering and of the Private Placement Warrants in the Private Placement were placed in the Trust Account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and invested only in U.S. “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. Government Treasury obligations, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account as described below. 
 Transaction costs of the initial public offering amounted to $22,407,388, consisting of $12,650,000 of underwriters’ fees and discounts, $9,276,147 for the excess fair value of founder shares attributable to the anchor investors, and $465,667 of other offering costs, net of third party vendor credits. The underwriters agreed to defer $8,050,000 of the underwriting discounts and commissions until our consummation of an initial business combination. 
 Our units began trading on October 5, 2021 on the Nasdaq Global Market (the “Nasdaq”) under the symbol “BHACU.” Commencing on November 26, 2021, the shares of Class A common stock and warrants comprising the units began separate trading on the Nasdaq under the symbols “BHAC” and “BHACW,” respectively. Those units not separated continue to trade on the Nasdaq under the symbol “BHACU.” 
 On December 7, 2022 (following approval by our stockholders at the special meeting), we effected the charter amendment and the trust amendment, the effect of which was to change our termination date from April 7, 2023 to the new termination date of August 7, 2023 (unless further extended in accordance with our amended and restated certificate of incorporation by our sponsor (or its affiliates or designees) providing to us the requisite notice and the deposit amount). In connection with the charter amendment, 17,987,408 public shares were tendered for redemption. After giving effect to the early redemptions, we had approximately $51.2 million remaining in the trust account.

 Our Sponsor 
 Our Sponsor is Crixus BH3 Sponsor LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. Our sponsor was founded by affiliates of BH3 Management and is managed and controlled by BH3 Management. The co-sponsors of Spartacus Acquisition Corporation (Nasdaq: TMTS) (“Spartacus”) are also anchor investors in our sponsor and one of its representatives serves on our investment committee. 
 Our sponsor and its anchor investors have had numerous points of collaboration and a multi-decade history of investing in real estate, construction, infrastructure and technology investments, and bring together substantial assets and resources of each group with respect to our target sectors, investment selection and diligence, public company governance and management, and capital raising. We intend to capitalize on the ability of our sponsor team to identify and acquire a business that can benefit from the team’s collective expertise and disciplined approach to capital allocation and investment oversight. Our sponsor team has extensive backgrounds and national reach, which we believe position us to take advantage of the significant set of opportunities in the large and changing real estate, construction and infrastructure sectors. 
 With respect to the above, past experience or performance of our sponsor team and their respective affiliates is not a guarantee of either (i) our ability to successfully identify and execute a business combination or (ii) success with respect to any business combination that we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of our sponsor team or their respective affiliates as indicative of future performance. 
 Acquisition Criteria 
 We believe target sectors within the real estate, construction and infrastructure industries represent a unique assortment of opportunities for value creation given the direct industry experience of our sponsor team. We believe reviewing a large set of potential opportunities increases the probability of finding an attractive business combination and we expect that our target selection process will leverage our sponsor team’s extensive relationship network of family offices, REITs, private equity and venture capital sponsors, as well as relationships with management teams of public and private companies, investment bankers, attorneys and accountants who we believe should provide us with significant business combination opportunities. 
 We have identified the following criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses: 
 

• | Strong Fundamentals. Companies that have strong fundamentals, and leading positions within the real estate, construction and infrastructure industries, or otherwise derive a large component of revenue or enterprise value from real estate, construction or infrastructure related activities. We intend to evaluate the target businesses based on several factors, including growth characteristics, competitive positioning, profitability margins and sustainability.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Hidden Value. We are looking for unseen value or other characteristics that have been disregarded by the marketplace. We intend to leverage the operational experience and financial acumen of our sponsor team to focus on unlocking value others may have overlooked or our sponsor team may have a unique ability to affect.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Attractive Risk Adjusted Returns. We intend to seek target businesses that we believe will offer an attractive risk-adjusted return on investment for our stockholders. Financial returns will be evaluated based on both organic cash flow growth potential and an ability to create value through new initiatives. Potential upside from growth in the business will be weighed against downside risks.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Proven Unit Economics and Growing Companies. We intend to seek target businesses that have generated or are expected to generate attractive unit economics at scale. We intend to focus on target businesses that have established and growing revenue streams, or strong potential to establish such revenue. We do not intend to acquire companies that are excessively leveraged.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
6 


 
• | Competitive Position. We intend to seek target businesses that have, or have a strong potential to establish, a leading, growing or unique niche market position in their respective sectors, and we intend to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of these businesses relative to their competitors. We intend to seek to invest in one or more businesses that demonstrate advantages when compared to their competitors, including capable management team, defensible proprietary technology or market position, strong adoption rates, and relevant domain expertise.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Capable Management Team. We intend to seek target businesses that have experienced management teams or those that provide a platform for us to assemble an effective and capable management team. We intend to seek management teams with a track record of driving revenue growth and creating value for their stockholders.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Benefit from Being a Public Company. We intend to seek target businesses that we believe will benefit from being publicly listed and can effectively utilize the broader access to capital and the public profile to grow and accelerate stockholder value creation.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential for Stable Free Cash Flow. We intend to seek target businesses that have historically generated, or have strong potential to generate, strong and sustainable free cash flow.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, we expect to consider a variety of factors with respect to potential acquisition opportunities, including, among others: 
 

• | financial condition and results of operations;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | growth potential;
--+------------------


• | experience and skill of management and availability of additional personnel;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | capital requirements;
--+----------------------


• | stage of development of the business and its products or services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | degree of current or potential market acceptance of the products or services;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | proprietary aspects of products and the extent of intellectual property or other protection for products or formulas;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | impact of regulatory environment and potential future regulation on the business;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | seasonal sales fluctuations and the ability to offset these fluctuations through other acquisitions, introduction of new products, or product line extensions; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the amount of working capital available.
--+-----------------------------------------

 These criteria and guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general criteria and guidelines as well as other considerations, factors, criteria and guidelines that our management may deem relevant. If we find an opportunity that we believe is more compelling than other opportunities with the characteristics described above, we would pursue such an opportunity. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet a majority of the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet a majority of the above criteria and guidelines in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed hereby, would be in the form of tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials that we would file with the SEC. 
 In addition to any potential business candidates we may identify on our own, we anticipate that other target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, investment bankers, advisors, private equity funds and large business enterprises seeking to divest non-core assets or divisions.

 Our Investment Committee and Acquisition Process 
 In evaluating a prospective target business, we conduct an extensive due diligence review which encompasses, as applicable and among other things, commercial and industry due diligence, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities and a review of financial, operational, legal and other information about the target and its industry. To help facilitate this evaluation, we rely on input from our management team, sponsor and directors, including third party diligence providers if and as necessary. 
 Our process includes sourcing acquisition target candidates from our professional advisors and sponsor team, through a systematic process coordinated by management. Management then conducts initial reviews of potential candidates which are aggregated for review by the investment committee, prior to submission to the board for consideration. The investment committee is currently comprised of Daniel Lebensohn and Gregory Freedman (our co-CEOs), Eric Edidin (a board member), Daniel Adan (an independent board member), Neil Subin (an advisory board member), David Mansell (an advisory board member), and Rob Sales (a dedicated third party consultant to the Company). Each of Mr. Edidin, Mr. Adan and Mr. Mansell have substantial private equity and public markets experience evaluating, acquiring and managing operating companies with a similar range of size and stages to our target business combination candidates. Mr. Sales brings specific expertise in performing due diligence and identifying opportunities to create operational and strategic value in prospective target companies. 
 Each of our directors, officers, and members of our management team, directly or indirectly, own founder shares and/or private placement warrants and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, such directors and officers may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such directors and officers is included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. 
 Certain of our officers and directors presently have, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities, pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity subject to his or her fiduciary duties. As a result, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, then, subject to such officer’s and director’s fiduciary duties, he or she will need to honor such fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, before we can pursue such opportunity. If these other entities decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing the same. However, we do not expect these duties or obligations to materially affect our ability to identify and pursue business combination opportunities or complete our initial business combination. 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any business combination opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Company and it is an opportunity that we are able to complete on a reasonable basis. In addition, we may pursue an acquisition opportunity jointly with our sponsor, or one or more of its affiliates (“Affiliated Joint Acquisition”) with an entity to which an officer or director has a fiduciary or contractual obligation. Any such entity may co-invest with us in the target business at the time of our initial business combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the acquisition by issuing to such entity a class of equity or equity-linked securities. 
 In addition, our founders, officers and directors, are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs, and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. 
 Initial Business Combination 
 In accordance with the rules of Nasdaq, our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting discounts held in trust and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. 
 
8 


 We refer to this as the 80% of net assets test. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). Even though our board of directors will rely on generally accepted standards, our board of directors will have discretion to select the standards employed. In addition, the application of the standards generally involves a substantial degree of judgment. Accordingly, investors will be relying on the business judgment of the board of directors in evaluating the fair market value of the target or targets. The proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents used by us in connection with any proposed transaction will provide public stockholders with our analysis of our satisfaction of the 80% of net assets test, as well as the basis for our determinations. If our board of directors is not able independently to determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of a target business or businesses, it may be unable to do so if the board is less familiar or experienced with the target company’s business, there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the target company’s assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the board determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. Since any opinion, if obtained, would merely state that the fair market value of the target business meets the 80% of net assets test, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of a target business or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed to our stockholders. However, if required under applicable law, any proxy statement that we deliver to stockholders and file with the SEC in connection with a proposed transaction will include such opinion. 
 We may pursue an Affiliated Joint Acquisition. Our sponsor, or one or more of its affiliates, may co-invest with us in the target business at the time of our initial business combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the acquisition by issuing to such parties a class of equity or equity-linked securities. Any such issuance of equity or equity-linked securities would, on a fully diluted basis, reduce the percentage ownership of our then-existing stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions of our Class B common stock, issuances or deemed issuances of Class A common stock or equity-linked securities would result in an adjustment to the ratio at which shares of Class B common stock shall convert into shares of Class A common stock such that our initial stockholders and their permitted transferees, if any, would retain their aggregate percentage ownership at 20% of the sum of the total number of all common stock outstanding upon completion of the initial public offering plus all shares of Class A common stock and equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with the business combination (excluding any shares or equity-linked securities issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the business combination), unless the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Class B common stock agree to waive such adjustment with respect to such issuance or deemed issuance at the time thereof. Our sponsor and its affiliates have no obligation to make any such investment, and may compete with us for potential business combinations. 
 We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-business combination company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-business combination company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. 
 
9 


 If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-business combination company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable. We do not currently intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination. Subject to the foregoing, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. 
 To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors. 
 The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. 
 Extension and Redemptions 
 On December 7, 2022 (following approval by our stockholders at the special meeting), we effected the charter amendment and the trust amendment, the effect of which was to change our termination date from April 7, 2023 to the new termination date (August 7, 2023, unless further extended in accordance with our amended and restated certificate of incorporation by our sponsor (or its affiliates or designees) providing to us the requisite notice and the deposit amount). In connection with the charter amendment, 17,987,408 public shares were tendered for redemption. After giving effect to the early redemptions, we had approximately $51.2 million remaining in the trust account. 
Other Considerations 
 We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, founders, officers, advisory board members or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor or any of our founders, officers, advisory board members or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that such initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. 
 The members of our sponsor team may sponsor, form or participate in other blank check companies similar to ours during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Any such companies may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an acquisition target, particularly in the event there is overlap among investment mandates. However, we do not believe that any such potential conflicts would materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination, because our sponsor team has significant experience in identifying and executing multiple acquisition opportunities simultaneously, and we believe there are multiple potential opportunities in the industries of our primary focus. 
 Competition 
 In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash to our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights in connection with our initial business combination may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.

 Employees 
 We currently have three executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. 
Our Website 
 Our corporate website address is www.bh3ac.com. The information contained on, or accessible through our corporate website or any other website that we may maintain is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report. 
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 
 We have registered our units, Class A common stock and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. 
 We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with the requirements outlined above, or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material. 
 We are required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition. 
 We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 
 If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 
 
11 


 In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the Market Value of the shares of our Class A common stock that are held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700.0 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.

 RISK FACTORS SUMMARY 
 An investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. The occurrence of one or more of the events or circumstances described in the section titled “Risk Factors,” alone or in combination with other events or circumstances, may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and operating results. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Such risks include, but are not limited to: 

• | We are a recently incorporated company with no operating history and no revenues, and you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Past performance by our sponsor team or their respective affiliates (including our founders) may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in us or in the future performance of any business that we may acquire.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our public stockholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our proposed initial business combination, and even if we have a vote, holders of our founder shares will participate in such vote, which means we may complete our initial business combination even though a majority of our public stockholders do not support such a combination.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Your only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential business combination will be limited to the exercise of your right to redeem your shares from us for cash, unless we seek stockholder approval of such business combination.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Participation in the initial public offering by the anchor investors could reduce the public float for our securities, and could result in our inability to satisfy the Nasdaq continued listing requirements.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our outstanding warrants may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult to effectuate our initial business combination.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We may issue additional shares of capital stock or debt securities to complete a business combination, which would reduce the equity interest of our stockholders and likely cause a change in control of our ownership.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We may be unable to obtain additional financing, if required, to complete a business combination or to fund the operations and growth of the target business.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Resources could be wasted in researching acquisitions that are not consummated, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our search for a business combination, and any target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination, may be materially adversely affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and other events, and the status of debt and equity markets.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We may have a limited ability to assess the management of a prospective target business and, as a result, may consummate our initial business combination with a target business whose management may not have the skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | There may be tax consequences to our initial business combination that may adversely affect us.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our officers and directors presently have fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our officers and directors may have interests in a potential business combination that are different than yours, which may create conflicts of interest.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Nasdaq may delist our securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit investors’ ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.

• | We may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner that may be adverse to holders of public warrants with the approval by the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding public warrants.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our warrants are accounted for as a warrant liability and will be recorded at fair value upon issuance with changes in fair value for each period reported in earnings, which may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stocks or may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination.

• | If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than $10.10 per share.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock and could entrench management.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, subject to limited exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation matters, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or stockholders.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them upon redemption of their shares.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders until after the consummation of our initial business combination.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | If we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which may make it difficult for us to complete our initial business combination.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We are an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies, this could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cyber incidents or attacks directed at us could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.

• | There are no assurances that approvals of the charter amendment Proposal and the trust amendment Proposal will enable us to complete an initial business combination.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The SEC has recently proposed rules to regulate special purpose acquisition companies. Certain of the procedures that we, a potential business combination target, or others may determine to undertake in connection with such may increase our costs and the time needed to complete our initial business combination and may constrain the circumstances under which we could complete an initial business combination.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | If we were deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we may be forced to abandon our efforts to complete an initial business combination and instead be required to liquidate. To avoid that result, on or shortly prior to the 24-month anniversary of the effective date of the IPO Registration Statement, or at such earlier time as may be required by law or regulation, or that we determine in our discretion is advisable to avoid such a result, we will liquidate the securities held in the Trust Account and instead hold all funds in the Trust Account in cash. As a result, following such liquidation, we will likely receive minimal interest, if any, on the funds held in the Trust Account, which would reduce the dollar amount that our public stockholders would receive upon any redemption or liquidation of the Company.

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We may be deemed a “foreign person” under the regulations relating to CFIUS and our failure to obtain any required approvals within the requisite time period may require us to liquidate.
