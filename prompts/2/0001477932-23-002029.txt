ITEM 1: BUSINESS
A) General

Crown Equity Holdings Inc. formerly known as Micro Bio-Medical Waste Systems, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated on August 31, 1995 as "Visioneering Corporation" under the laws of the State of Nevada. 

In December, 2010, the Company formed two wholly owned subsidiaries Crown Tele Services Inc. and CRWE Direct Inc. Crown Tele Services Inc. was formed to provide voice over internet services to clients at a competitive price, CRWE Direct Inc. was formed to provide direct sales to customers.

In December 2011, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary CRWE Real Estate Inc. to hold real estate. This entity had no sales during the year. The company sold the above subsidiaries (Crown Tele Services Inc., CRWE Direct, and CRWE Real Estate Inc.) on the 28th of December, 2017.

At the present time, the Company is offering its services to domestic and global companies seeking to become public entities in the United States. It has launched a website, www.crownequityholdings.com, which offers its services in a wide range of fields. The Company provides various consulting services to companies and individuals dealing with corporate structure and operations globally. The Company also provides public relations and news dissemination for publicly and privately held companies.

In 2009, the Company re-focused its primary vision to using its network of websites to provide advertising and marketing services, as a worldwide online media advertising publisher, dedicated to the distribution of quality branding information. The Company offers Internet media-driven advertising services, which cover and connect a wide range of marketing specialties, as well as search engine optimization for clients interested in online media awareness. As part of its operations, the Company has utilized the services of software and hardware technicians in developing its websites and adding additional websites. This allows the Company to disseminate news and press releases for its customers as well as general news and financial information on a much bigger scale than it did previously. The Company markets its services to companies seeking market awareness of them and the services or goods that they offer. The Company then publishes information concerning these companies on its many websites. The Company is paid in cash and/or stock of the customer companies. The condition of online publishing remains at an all-time high and is continuing to evolve and grow. It is to a point where online publishing is a key component of a publishing company's strategy in the print dominated market. No longer is the possession of printed reading material adding value to a reader's experience.

At the moment, the majority of the Company's publishing sites have light to relatively medium traffic. The Company is presently in the process of strengthening its online publishing competitive position with its strategy of producing and obtaining a stronger presence with its community targeted online news and information publishing. The Company has increased its web presence with the dedicated community targeted news and information publishing websites. The Company has increased its readership to create a stronger competitive position within the online publishing industry. The company is continuing its efforts with increasing its readership to obtain advertisers wanting to reach its viewership. 

The Company's office is located at 11226 Pentland Downs Street, Las Vegas, NV 89141. The Company is provided office space by one of the officers and directors at no charge.

As of December 31, 2022, the Company utilized the services of independent contractors during the year. Officersâ€™ compensation is detailed in Part III, Item 11 of this filing.
