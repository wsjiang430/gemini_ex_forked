ITEM 1. BUSINESS
The Company


The Company was incorporated under the laws of Florida on September 21, 2005, and currently focuses on the business of using proprietary fintech technology to provide mobile and e-commerce services for delivering financial, prepaid debit and digital content services to the unbanked, underbanked and underserved Latino, Hispanic and immigrant communities. The Company’s proprietary software platform enables Cuentas to offer comprehensive financial services and robust functionality that is absent from other Mobile Apps through the use of our Prepaid Debit Mastercard®/General-Purpose Reloadable cards (“GPR”). The Company is diversifying with its initial investment in the first affordable apartment building in Florida using patented, hurricane proof (up to CAT 5) technology.

WU and Cuentas Bridge Digital and Retail Money Transfer Worlds for Latino Community



On or about March 8, 2022, the Company has integrated Western Union’s (“WU”) domestic and international money transfer capabilities into the Cuentas mobile banking app. The integration enables the Company’s customers to send money to 200 countries and territories via the Cuentas mobile app. Leveraging Western Union’s leading global cross-border, cross-currency platform, The Company’s customers can conveniently move money to friends and family almost anywhere across the world using the Cuentas mobile app. Once sent, receivers can pick up their remittance in cash at any Western Union retail location.










A major factor that provides technical strength and reliability to Cuentas’ project is the fintech ecosystem that it has developed. The foundation of Cuentas’ ecosystem is the fintech platform with mobile app, mobile wallet and associated integrations that Cuentas has developed over the past 3 years. We believe that this platform has been proven to be a robust, reliable transactional, marketing, financial and predictive, Tier-1 transactional platform. Cuentas’ ecosystem integrates its platform via dedicated APIs with Sutton Bank (the issuing bank), IDology (AML & KYC) and InComm (Processor, Load Network & 3rd Party Digital Products). During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company performed its annual impairment test for the impairment of those intangible assets. Based on the Company's qualitative analysis, which considered the electronic products and General Purpose Reloadable Cards reporting unit results and additional business and industry specific considerations including the impact of the settlement agreement with CIMA Telecom, the Company performed a further revisions of the fair value of the acquired platforms. As a result of the factors discussed the company recorded an impairment charge of $3.6 million whereas no amount was assigned to the acquired platforms on December 31, 2022



Cuentas’ Mobile App includes a Mobile Wallet (“Wallet”) and a Digital Store (the “Cuentas Digital Store” or the “Digital Store”) and is linked with a Prepaid Mastercard® which can be used for ATM withdrawals, online purchases and in-person purchases.




Account holders may deposit funds to their account via (a) no-cost Direct Deposit, (b) no-cost fund transfers from other Cuentas account holders, or (c) for a small charge, using InComm’s VanillaLoad network in over 200,000 locations at major retailers like Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, Dollar General, and more.



Once account holders have available funds, they can use their Cuentas Prepaid Mastercard® wherever prepaid Mastercards are accepted worldwide and at most ATMs in the U.S., and many international ATMs.


Account holders may use the funds in their Wallet to purchase discounted gift cards in the Cuentas Digital Store. Product categories in the Digital Store include Digital Gift Cards, Transit Cards, Mobile Phone Recharges (the “TopUps”) and Western Union International Remittances. Digital gift cards include Amazon Cash, Sony Playstation, Xbox, Karma Koin, Burger King, Bass Pro Shops and more. Active transit products include TAP in Los Angeles, GoCT in Connecticut and The Rapid from Grand Rapids, Michigan. These should include the digital availability of OMNY in New York when it launches officially. Additional transit products will be available as InComm rolls them out. Cuentas account holders may purchase TopUps (Prepaid Mobile Phone Recharges) which allow them to recharge their own or someone else’s Verizon, AT&T or other mobile phones in the U.S. or in many foreign countries – in real time. Account holders may make real phone calls using the Cuentas ILD Rewards balance (Loyalty Program) or funds in their wallet - actual phone calls that are made directly from their phone to any mobile phone or land line worldwide. 




Cuentas e-commerce Distribution and Mobile Payments



The Cuentas e-commerce Distribution and Mobile Payments ecosystem will allow consumers to purchase Cuentas’s line of digital products and services through a nationwide network of retailers that specifically serve Cuentas’ target market. Cuentas’ distribution network includes certain neighborhood markets known as “Bodegas” and convenience stores as well as other retail establishments. This brings previously unavailable digital products and services to those neighborhoods affected by the e-commerce digital divide.
The Latino Market 



The name “Cuentas” is a Spanish word that has multiple meanings and was chosen for strategic reasons, to develop a close relationship with the Spanish speaking population. It means “Accounts” as in “bank accounts” and it can also mean “You can count on me” as in “Cuentas conmigo”. Additionally, it can be used to “Pay or settle accounts” (saldar cuentas), “accountability” (rendición de cuentas), “to be accountable” (rendir cuentas) and other significant meanings.


The 2020 U.S. Census showed the Hispanic Latino population at over 62 million and at 18.7% of the total U.S. population. The FDIC defines the “unbanked” “as those adults without an account at a bank or other financial institution and are considered to be outside the mainstream for one reason or another. The Company believes that the Hispanic and Latino demographic generally have had more identification, credit, and former bank account issues than any other U.S. minority group leading to more difficulty in obtaining a traditional bank account.




Cuentas Mobile App and Wallet


The Cuentas Mobile App and Wallet are positioned to service the Hispanic, Latino and immigrant demographics with comprehensive financial products. Additionally, we are able to accept various forms of U.S. and some foreign government issued identification to confirm qualification for opening an account with the Cuentas App. The Cuentas App is able to accept SSN or ITIN with U.S. identification, Matricula Consular or other qualified government issued forms of identification.
The Cuentas Prepaid Mastercard® - General-Purpose Reloadable (GPR) Card



The Cuentas Prepaid GPR Card allows each account holder to have a personalized Cuentas Mastercard® and an associated Cuentas Account with the Mobile App, Digital Wallet, Digital Store and Long Distance Telecom services included. It acts as a comprehensive banking solution which enables access to the U.S. financial system for those who are unbanked or underbanked, while also enabling greater functionality than a traditional bank account. The cardholders’ deposited funds are protected in an FDIC-insured bank account at Sutton Bank. 
The Cuentas Business Model



The Cuentas business model provides or, we expect will provide, for multiple revenue sources, many of which are synergistic market segments and provide unified financial and social functionality to forgotten segments of society.


The Cuentas Mobile Wallet has several current and potential revenue streams. The Company currently receives and expect that the Company will continue to receive monthly maintenance fees, reload fees, ATM fees and commissions for products sold as well as interchange and network fees from Mastercard and the Pulse Network (see “The Cuentas Ecosystem” herein).. Cuentas’ strategy is to provide excellent value to consumers while charging reasonable fees and commissions to produce profitability. We believe that monthly fees of $4.50 which we will charge per user will generate reasonable revenue. Cuentas provides account recharge capabilities to account holders via the nationwide VanillaLoad network owned by InComm as it is available in many big box retailer chains such as Walmart, Walgreens, CVS, Dollar Store and others.



The Cuentas Digital Store produces revenue each time that consumers purchase third party gift cards, digital access, mass transit tickets and mobile phone top-ups (U.S. and international). Additionally, International remittances provided by the industry-leader Western Union “by Cuentas” are currently available and International Bill Pay should be available in 2023. Both services should be major revenue driving factors for Cuentas as they provide reliable, low-cost solutions to our target audience.



Cuentas offers rewards for free long distance calling to its account holders (“Cuentas Rewards”) who are given credits upon activation to be able to make real international calls to land lines or mobile phone worldwide, not like internet calling which can be unreliable and poor quality. We can expand the Rewards program to include other products and/or services in the future. Our target demographic uses both internet and prepaid calling services to communicate with family members around the U.S. and in their country. This added benefit is designed, at a very low cost, to provide extra benefits to our accountholders, which should help to maintain and solidify valuable relationships with them.




Prepaid Debit Card Market Overview



The Research and Markets report titled “Prepaid Card Market: Payment Trends, Market Dynamics, and Forecasts 2020 - 2025” released in January 2020 states that, “[i]n the United States, prepaid cards remain the preferred choice for the unbanked market segment....” It also states that “[t]he move towards a cashless society is substantial, further driving the prepaid card market.”



Cuentas is strategically positioned in the prepaid marketplace with a focus on the Hispanic, Latino and immigrant demographics.


Cuentas does not charge Activation Fees to our account holders as we have identified this as an important issue to our target demographic. Cuentas sends a personalized Prepaid Mastercard® directly to each approved applicant in the US, and we only charge a monthly fee of $4.50, fifteen days after activation and every thirty days thereafter. As previously mentioned, we also model our offering with empathy and consideration for our target demographic, keeping fees and costs reasonably low so they will be able to justify and appreciate the benefits provided by the Cuentas Mobile App, Wallet and Prepaid Mastercard®.

On July 8, 2022, the Company announced that it received a notice of default from CIMA related to that certain Platform Exclusive License Agreement, maintenance, and related agreements (collectively, the “License Agreement”) by and among Cuentas, CIMA, Knetik, Inc. (“Knetik”), and Auris, LLC (“Auris”). The notice, which was received May 25, 2022, provides that Cuentas has failed to pay $700,000 of maintenance and pass-through fees that CIMA alleges are owed under the License Agreement and also afforded Cuentas the required sixty-day period (through July 24, 2022) to cure the default as provided under the License Agreement.

Cuentas SDI, LLC (the “Cuentas-SDI”) was incorporated in the State of Florida on January 4, 2022 and was a wholly owned subsidiary of SDI Black 011, Inc. (“SDI Black”). Cuentas-SDI is engaged in the business of electronic distribution and sales of virtual products via its Black 011 portal located at Yonkers, NY.

The Cuentas Ecosystem



Cuentas’ goal is to offer the consumer a one-stop shop, easy to use, Mobile App & Mobile wallet with Mastercard® rails that can provide new, important financial services and solve many of their daily needs and desires while saving the users time and money.



Approved Cuentas accountholders will have a Prepaid Mastercard® acceptable wherever Mastercard® debit cards are accepted and can have their paychecks or certain government benefits checks directly deposited to their account associated with the card, with funds available for use on the card up to 2 days earlier than standard direct deposits. Furthermore, the Cuentas card has ATM access through the nationwide Pulse Network which provides access to over 500,000 ATMs in the U.S. and many more worldwide. (source: pulsenetwork.com)



The Cuentas Digital Store in the Mobile App will allow accountholders to purchase certain mainstream gift cards for use in a variety of stores, online portals and transit agencies – many at discounted prices. Accountholders can also “Top Up” or prepay their mobile phone accounts and also do the same for friends & family living in the US or overseas.



Cuentas Mobile 



Cuentas Mobile is our Mobile Virtual Network Operator (“MVNO”) trade name, which provided Cuentas Mobile branded mobile phones along with attractively priced prepaid voice, text, and data mobile phone services to a limited customer base. Cuentas, through M&M is negotiating to sell mobile services as an MVNO throug an operator on the largest 5G nationwide network from one of the top 3 mobile carriers. Cuentas Mobile will continue to operate a virtual telecommunications network providing mobile voice, text, and data services with essentially the same quality as other MVNOs such as Cricket, Boost, Simple, Ultra, Mint, and Lyca Mobile which have been successful at creating brands, without owning the towers, hardware or network. Cuentas is currently reactivating distribution through grass roots retailers that normally interact with Cuentas’ target audience, specifically offering low-cost mobile phone service with the ability to make international calls to specific Spanish speaking countries in Central and South America.



We believe that our potential customers will migrate away from legacy telephone and banking systems to enhanced mobility solutions. The Company’s technological advantage and the synergies created by its combination of a reloadable debit card and a holder of mobile virtual network operator rights will make its products increasingly useful to unbanked, under-banked, under-served and other emerging niche markets.



Meimoun & Mammon LLC


Meimoun & Mammon LLC (“M&M”) is a retail provider of domestic and international long-distance voice, text, and data telephony services to consumers in the United States and throughout the world. M&M holds International and Domestic Section 214 authority issued by the FCC. M&M operates the retail Tel3 business as a separate division. Tel3 has been a prepaid long distance provider for many years and provides direct and indirect access to Latino and immigrant communities across the US as it provides them with quality international communications services.
LSI Group S.A. (“LSI”)



On Aug 31, 2022, Cuentas signed a 1-year agreement which is extendable to 3 years total with completion of certain milestones. LSI will market the US based Cuentas Prepaid Debit Card and Mobile App in countries including El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras with plans to expand to South America, starting with Colombia, with the goal to sign 200,000 US-based Cuentas customers in 1 year for international cross-border remittances. As of date, the Company has not generated revenues through LSI.
Regulatory Compliance



We operate in an ever-evolving and complex legal and regulatory environment. We, the products and services that we offer and market, and those for which we provide processing services, are subject to a variety of federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, including, but not limited to: federal communications laws and regulations; foreign jurisdiction communications laws and regulations; federal anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the Patriot Act, the BSA, anti-terrorist financing laws and anti-bribery and corrupt practice laws and regulations in the U.S., and similar international laws and regulations, including the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act in Canada; state unclaimed property laws and money transmitter or similar licensing requirements; federal and state consumer protection laws, including the CARD Act, and the Dodd-Frank Act, and regulations relating to privacy and data security; and foreign jurisdiction payment services industry regulations.



Our subsidiary M&M is subject to regulation by the FCC and other government agencies and task forces. M&M holds International and Domestic Section 214 licenses issued by the FCC, which may be suspended or revoked by the FCC if M&M does not strictly comply with all applicable regulations and the terms and conditions under which the International and Domestic Section 214 licenses were issued. M&M is also subject to certain foreign jurisdiction communications laws and regulations as it provides limited access to its prepaid calling platform internationally . We believe that we, including our subsidiaries, are currently operating in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, but there is no certainty that laws and regulations affecting our business will not change. Any such change of laws and regulations applicable to our business might adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and achieve profitable operating results.



At the federal level, Congress and federal regulatory agencies have enacted and implemented new laws and regulations that affect the prepaid industry, such the CARD Act and FinCEN’s Prepaid Access Rule. Moreover, there are currently proposals before Congress that could further substantially change the way banks, including prepaid card issuing banks and other financial services companies, are regulated and are permitted to offer their products to consumers. Non-bank financial services companies, including money transmitters and prepaid access providers, are now regulated at the federal level by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), which began operations in July 2011, bringing additional uncertainty to the regulatory system and its impact on our business. We are increasingly facing more stringent anti-money laundering rules and regulations, compliance with which may increase our costs of operation, decrease our operating revenues and disrupt our business. Sutton bank performs routine AML, KYC, OFAC in consultation with Cuentas and IDology and other compliance review and searches throughout Cuentas’ registration and operational processes. Abuse of our prepaid products for purposes of financing sanctioned countries, terrorist funding, bribery or corruption could cause reputational or other harm that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Failure to comply with, or further expansion of, consumer protection regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Failure by us to comply with federal banking regulation may subject us to fines and penalties and our relationships with our issuing banks may be harmed.



Most states regulate the business of sellers of traveler’s checks, money orders, drafts and other monetary instruments, which we refer to collectively as money transmitters. While many states expressly exempt banks and their agents from regulation as money transmitters, others purport to regulate the money transmittal businesses of bank agents or do not extend exemptions to non-branch bank agents. In those states where we are required to be licensed, we are subject to direct supervision and regulation by the relevant state banking departments or similar agencies charged with enforcement of the money transmitter statutes and must comply with various restrictions and requirements, such as those related to the maintenance of certain levels of net worth, surety bonding, selection and oversight of our authorized delegates, permissible investments in an amount equal to our outstanding payment obligations with respect to some of the products subject to licensure, recordkeeping and reporting, and disclosures to consumers. We are also subject to periodic examinations by the relevant licensing authorities, which may include reviews of our compliance practices, policies and procedures, financial position and related records, various agreements that we have with our issuing banks, retail distribution partners and other third parties, privacy and data security policies and procedures, and other matters related to our business. As a regulated entity, Cuentas may incur significant costs associated with regulatory compliance. We anticipate that compliance costs and requirements will increase in the future for our regulated subsidiaries and that additional subsidiaries will need to become subject to these or new regulations. If we fail to maintain our existing money transmitter licenses or permits, or fail to obtain new licenses or permits in a timely manner, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.



Marketing



The Cuentas Mobile App, Mobile Wallet and Prepaid Mastercard® will be predominantly marketed via digital and traditional media channels. Cuentas expects to use a combination of internal resources as well as third parties for our marketing efforts.



The digital marketing placements will include social media, SEO (Search Engine Optimization), internet, geo fencing, online streaming providers, influencers, and other digital providers. Traditional marketing efforts include media such as radio, TV, print, billboards, bus wraps, bus benches, TV, radio, etc.



Media spend is distributed amongst these marketing vehicles and adjusted as acquisition data is received. Our initial program is designed to test creative, geo targeting and formats. Once feedback is analyzed, spending will be optimized to enhance efficiency and cost of acquisition. Vertical market integration and partnerships will also be developed to augment growth and stability.














Marketing strategies for customer acquisition have focused on key markets, targeted audiences, lifestyle fit, brand awareness, key metrics and go-to-market plans, especially where Hispanic & Latino groups are concentrated, such as Southern California, Texas, New York, Florida, Arizona and New Mexico. The marketing relationship with the indoor professional MASL (Major Arena Soccer League) soccer league for the 2022-2023 season has introduced the Cuentas brand and services to sports fans throughout the 14 team cities, with additional reach through streaming of the pro soccer games through the Twitch streaming network. The demographics of soccer fans is directly in line with Cuentas’ target audience.



Cuentas will promote the newly integrated POS capabilities in its ecosystem and market these services to the 30,000 bodegas and convenience stores in the network, with the possibility of upgrading a select number of them to neighborhood financial centers to be able to load cash to the Cuentas prepaid debit card and provide other financial services.

Reverse Split and Offering 



On February 6, 2023, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with an institutional investor (the “Investor”) for the purpose of raising approximately $5 million in gross proceeds for the Company. Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to sell, in a registered direct offering, an aggregate of (i) 163,344 shares (the “Shares”) of the Company’s common stock (“Common Stock”) and (ii) pre-warrants to purchase up to 128,031 shares of Common Stock (the “Pre-Funded Warrants” and such shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Pre-Funded Warrants, the “Pre-Funded Warrant Shares”) and, in a concurrent private placement, warrants (the “Purchase Warrants”) to purchase 291,375 shares of Common Stock (the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Purchase Warrants, the “Purchase Warrant Shares”). The combined purchase price per Share and Purchase Warrant is $17.16 and the combined purchase price per Pre-Funded Warrant and Purchase Warrant of $17.16.



The Pre-Funded Warrants were sold, in lieu of shares of Common Stock, to any Investor whose purchase of shares of Common Stock in the Registered Offering would otherwise result in such Investor, together with its affiliates and certain related parties, beneficially owning more than 4.99% (or, at such Investor’s option upon issuance, 9.99%) of the Company’s outstanding Common Stock immediately following the consummation of the Registered Offering. Each Pre-Funded Warrant represents the right to purchase one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.0001 per share. The Pre-Funded Warrants are exercisable immediately and may be exercised at any time until the Pre-Funded Warrants are exercised in full.



The Purchase Warrants will be exercisable on the six-month anniversary of the issuance date and will expire five and one-half years following the date of issuance at an exercise price of $17.36 per share.



The closing of the sales of these securities under the Purchase Agreement occured on or about February 8, 2023, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions.



H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC (“Wainwright”) is acting as exclusive placement agent for the offering pursuant to an engagement agreement between the Company and Wainwright dated as of December 13, 2022. As compensation for such placement agent services, the Company has agreed to pay Wainwright an aggregate cash fee equal to 7.0% of the gross proceeds received by the Company from the offering, plus a management fee equal to 1.0% of the gross proceeds received by the Company from the offerings, a non-accountable expense of $65,000 and $15,950 for clearing expenses. The Company has also agreed to issue to Wainwright or its designees warrants to purchase 20,396 shares of Common Stock (the “PA Warrants” and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the PA Warrants, the “PA Warrant Shares”). The PA Warrants have a term of five years from the commencement of sales in the offering, and have an exercise price of $23.17 per share. The fair market of those warrants was $267 thousand as of date of issuance.



The net proceeds to the Company from the registered direct offering and concurrent private placement, after deducting the Placement Agent’s fees and expenses and the Company’s offering expenses was approximately $4.3 million.



On February 7, 2023 the investor exercised 67,800 Pre-Funded Warrants and in March 13, 2023 the investor exercised 60,231 Pre-Funded Warrants.



As previously disclosed, on June 21, 2022, the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Staff (the “Staff”) issued the Company a delist letter citing its failure to comply with the minimum bid price requirement under Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). In accordance with Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company was provided 180 calendar days, or until December 19, 2022, to regain compliance with Rule 5550(a)(2). On December 20, 2022, Staff notified the Company that it had determined to delist the Company as it did not comply with bid price requirement for listing on the Exchange. On December 27, 2022, the Company requested a hearing, which was held on February 9, 2023. On February 28, 2023, the Company announced that it received on February 23 formal notification from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) indicating that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) had determined to grant the Company’s request for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, pursuant to an extension through April 6, 2023, to evidence compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Bid Price Rule”). Such extension is subject to the conditions that (1) on or before March 23, 2023, the Company shall effect a reverse stock split at a ratio that is sufficient to ensure compliance with the Bid Price Rule and (2) on April 6, 2023, the Company shall have demonstrated compliance with the Bid Price Rule, by evidencing a closing bid price of $1 or more per share for a minimum of ten consecutive trading sessions. The Company is taking definitive steps to timely evidence compliance with the terms of the Panel’s decision; however, there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so by April 6, 2023, or that the Panel will grant a further extension if required.



On March 24, 2023, the Company completed a reverse stock split of its common stock. As a result of the reverse stock split, the following changes have occurred (i) every thirteen shares of common stock have been combined into one share of common stock; (ii) the number of shares of common stock underlying each common stock option or common stock warrant have been proportionately decreased on a 13-for-1 basis, and the exercise price of each such outstanding stock option and common warrant has been proportionately increased on a 13-for-1 basis. Accordingly, all option numbers, share numbers, warrant numbers, share prices, warrant prices, exercise prices and losses per share have been adjusted within these consolidated financial statements, on a retroactive basis, to reflect this 13-for-1 reverse stock split.
