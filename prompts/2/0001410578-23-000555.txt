Company Background
The Company was formed in Nevada in August 30, 2002 as IntelSource Group, Inc. and began operations in 2003. In 2007, IntelSource Group, Inc. merged with ElectroMedical Technologies, LLC. The Company began acting as Electro Medical Technologies, LLC, an Arizona limited liability company on November 9, 2010 after the merger with ElectroMedical Technologies, LLC, a Nevada Company. The Company converted to a corporation in the State of Delaware on August 23, 2017.
Electromedical Technologies is a bioelectronics manufacturing and marketing company. We offer U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared medical devices for pain management.
Bioelectronics is a developing field of “electronic” medicine, which uses electrical impulses over the body’s neural circuitry to try to alleviate pain, without drugs. The human body is controlled by electrical signals sent through the nervous system, which can become distorted after accidents or as a result of disease. The field of bioelectronic medicine aims to safely correct irregularities in the nervous system by modifying the electrical language of the body related to pain relief.
Our mission is to improve global wellness for people suffering from various painful conditions by relieving chronic and acute pain using energy, frequency and vibration as an alternative to pharmaceuticals; and that one day, read and modify electrical signals passing along nerves in the body, to restore long-term health.
Additionally, we have a corporate goal to offer the public effective alternatives to addictive pain-relieving drugs, such as opioids. According to the Society of Actuaries, opioid overdose deaths are now the single largest factor slowing the growth in U.S. life expectancy and has led to stagnation or decreases in life expectancy three years in a row for the first time since 1915–1918, when the country was facing World War I and the Spanish flu pandemic. The U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported that, from 1999 through 2017, nearly 400,000 have died from overdoses from prescription or illicit opioids. It is our aim to offer effective alternatives to pain management.
We believe that we do this by delivering innovative solutions providing fast and long-lasting pain relief across the broadest range of ailments. We engineer simple-to-use bioelectronics therapy devices, which send a proprietary sequence of electrical signals. We believe our devices have proven to be highly effective over the past decade and have the technological capability to be used in medical research.
The Company is publicly traded on the OTC Markets under the symbol EMED.

From 1999 to 2017, more than 702,000 people have died from a drug overdose. In 2017, more than 70,000 people died from drug overdoses, making it a leading cause of injury-related death in the United States. It is our aim to offer effective nontoxic, noninvasive alternatives to pain management.
We believe that we can provide an opioid-free solution to over 100 million people suffering from chronic and acute pain just in the US market alone. In recent years, we have also focused on the market for U.S. military service veterans, many of which do not have many options other than powerful drugs that can cause side effects when it comes to treating chronic or acute pain. We intend to include a special program that will offer our new POD devices at no upfront cost for the veterans of U.S. armed forces and their immediate families, which according to the Census Bureau, as of 2014, consists of nearly 22 million individuals.
Industry and Regulatory Overview
Medical devices are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) in the United States and can be regulated by foreign governments for devices sold internationally. The Company has medical device certifications in the USA (FDA),
The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations issued by the FDA regulate testing, manufacturing, packaging, and marketing of medical devices. Under the current regulations and standards, we believe that our devices are subject to general controls, including compliance with labeling and record-keeping rules. In addition, our medical devices require pre-market approval, which for TENS devices can be achieved through a 510(k) premarket notification submission.
Our manufacturing processes and facilities are also subject to regulations, including the FDA’s QSR requirements (formerly Good Manufacturing Practices). These regulations govern the way we manufacture our products and maintain documentation for our manufacturing, testing and control activities. In addition, to the extent we manufacture and sell products abroad, those products are subject to the relevant laws and regulations of those countries.
The labeling of our devices, our promotional activities and marketing materials are regulated by the FDA and various state agencies. Activities that are constrained by these regulations include the marketing of our products for “off-label” usage; that is, recommendations to use our products for purposes other than what is indicated in the labeling. Violations of this requirement may result in administrative, civil or criminal actions against the manufacturer or seller by the FDA or governing state agencies.
An element of our strategy is to continue to upgrade our products, add new features and expand clearance or approval of our current products to new indications. In the United States, before we can market a new medical device, or a new use of, new claim for or significant modification to an existing product, we must first receive either clearance under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, or approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA, from the FDA, unless an exemption applies. In the 510(k) clearance process, before a device may be marketed, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally-marketed “predicate” device, which includes a device that has been previously cleared through the 510(k) process, a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device), a device that was originally on the U.S. market pursuant to an approved PMA and later down-classified, or a 510(k)-exempt device. To be “substantially equivalent,” the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data are sometimes required to support substantial equivalence. In the PMA process, the FDA must determine 

4



that a proposed device is safe and effective for its intended use based, in part, on extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical, pre-clinical, clinical trial, manufacturing and labeling data. Our ability to successfully obtain clearance for any new indications will be dependent on us submitting data as to the successful completion of clinical trials evidencing safety and efficacy. The PMA process is typically required for devices that are deemed to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices. However, some devices are automatically subject to the PMA pathway regardless of the level of risk they pose because they have not previously been classified into a lower risk class by the FDA. Manufacturers of these devices may request that FDA review such devices in accordance with the de novo classification procedure, which allows a manufacturer whose novel device would otherwise require the submission and approval of a PMA prior to marketing to request down-classification of the device on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk. If the FDA agrees with the down classification, the applicant will then receive authorization to market the device. This device type can then be used as a predicate device for future 510(k) submissions. We initially received marketing authorization of our device through the de novo classification process, and we have made changes to our system through subsequent 510(k) clearances. The process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals, or completing the de novo classification process, to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming, and we may not be able to successfully obtain pre-market reviews on a timely basis, if at all.
Modifications to products that are approved through a PMA application generally require FDA approval. Similarly, certain modifications made to products cleared through a 510(k) or authorized through the de novo classification process may require a new 510(k) clearance. Each of the PMA approval, de novo classification and the 510(k) clearance processes can be expensive, lengthy and uncertain. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to 12 months, but can last longer. The process of obtaining a PMA is much more costly and uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process and generally takes from one to three years, or even longer, from the time the application is filed with the FDA. In addition, a PMA generally requires the performance of one or more clinical trials.
Despite the time, effort and cost, a device may not be approved or cleared by the FDA. Any delay or failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or clearances could harm our business. Furthermore, even if we are granted regulatory clearances or approvals, they may include significant limitations on the indicated uses for the device, which may limit the market for the device.
Any modifications to our existing products may require new 510(k) clearance; however, future modifications may be subject to the substantially more costly, time-consuming and uncertain PMA process. If the FDA requires us to go through a lengthier, more rigorous examination for future products or modifications to existing products than we had expected, product introductions or modifications could be delayed or canceled, which could cause our sales to decline.
The FDA can delay, limit or deny clearance or approval of a device for many reasons, including: we may be unable to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction that the product or modification is substantially equivalent to the proposed predicate device or safe and effective for its intended use; the data from our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support clearance or approval, where required; and the manufacturing process or facilities we use may not meet applicable requirements.
Even if granted, a 510(k) clearance, de novo classification, or PMA approval imposes substantial restrictions on how our devices may be marketed or sold, and the FDA continues to place considerable restrictions on our products and operations. For example, the manufacture of medical devices must comply with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or QSR. In addition, manufacturers must register their manufacturing facilities, list the products with the FDA, and comply with requirements relating to labeling, marketing, complaint handling, adverse event and medical device reporting, reporting of corrections and removals, and import and export. The FDA monitors compliance with the QSR and these other requirements through periodic inspections. If our facilities or those of our manufacturers or suppliers are found to be in violation of applicable laws and regulations, or if we or our manufacturers or suppliers fail to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse inspection, the regulatory authority could take enforcement action, including any of the following sanctions: untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; customer notifications or repair, replacement, refunds, detention or seizure of our products; operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approvals of new products or modified products; withdrawing 510(k) marketing clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted; refusing to provide Certificates for Foreign Government; refusing to grant export approval for our products; or pursuing criminal prosecution. Any of these sanctions could impair our ability to produce our products in a cost-effective and timely manner in order to meet our customers’ demands, and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. We may also be required to bear other costs or take other actions that may have a negative impact on our sales and our ability to generate profits.
In addition, the FDA may change its clearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions, which may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our future products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently cleared products on a timely basis. Such policy or regulatory changes could impose additional requirements upon us that could delay our ability to obtain new 510(k) clearances, increase the costs of compliance or restrict our ability to maintain our 

5



current clearances. We also cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad. For example, certain policies of the Trump administration may impact our business and industry. Namely, the Trump administration has taken several executive actions, including the issuance of a number of Executive Orders, that could impose significant burdens on, or otherwise materially delay, the FDA’s ability to engage in routine regulatory and oversight activities such as implementing statutes through rulemaking, issuance of guidance, and review and approval of marketing applications. It is difficult to predict how these executive actions, including the Executive Orders, will be implemented, and the extent to which they will impact the FDA’s ability to exercise its regulatory authority. If these executive actions impose constraints on FDA’s ability to engage in oversight and implementation activities in the normal course, our business may be negatively impacted.
In order to sell our products in member countries of the EEA our products must comply with the essential requirements of the EU Medical Devices Directive (Council Directive 93/42/EEC). Compliance with these requirements is a prerequisite to be able to affix the CE Mark to our products, without which they cannot be sold or marketed in the EEA. To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I non-sterile, non-measuring devices), where the manufacturer can issue an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the essential requirements of the EU Medical Devices Directive, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of an organization accredited by a Member State of the EEA to conduct conformity assessments, or a Notified Body. Depending on the relevant conformity assessment procedure, the Notified Body would typically audit and examine the technical file and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of our devices. The Notified Body issues a certificate of conformity following successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in relation to the medical device and its manufacturer and their conformity with the essential requirements. This certificate entitles the manufacturer to affix the CE Mark to its medical devices after having prepared and signed a related EC Declaration of Conformity.

Principal Products and Services
WellnessPro Plus
Our principal product, WellnessPro Plus, is an intelligent and effective bioelectronics therapy prescription device; and is used by consumers and health care professionals to relieve chronic and acute pain. Research studies have shown the efficacy of bioelectronics therapy in the treatment of chronic pain from a variety of ailments including: arthritis, chronic low back pain, fibromyalgia, diabetic neuropathy, Lyme disease, osteoarthritis, and neuropathic pain. This medical device is classified in the FDA as a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (“TENS”) device. We believe, based on consumer and professional testimonials from the past decade that our device has been on the market, that the WellnessPro Plus treats pain conditions faster with longer-lasting relief, compared to lower cost conventional TENS devises. We attribute this in part to our proprietary algorithm and technology that we call the “DeepPulse.” With the DeepPulse there are close to one million frequency ranges to choose from to help prevent accommodation. The device can also generate micro-current stimulation to mimic the body’s own electric signals.
The device sends a proprietary sequence of electrical signals that change at various times, preventing accommodation (where the body adapts to specific treatments, diminishing treatment effectiveness). Also, our proprietary DeepPulse pre-modulation technology allows signals to penetrate deeper into affected areas, which we believe produces faster, longer-lasting pain relief. Additionally, our micro-current mode delivers signals, which naturally mimic the body’s signals, triggering the body’s own natural ability to relieve pain via "endorphin release" and accelerating the ION pump exchange. This allows for reduction of pain, increased microcirculation and oxygenation of red blood cells, which in turn helps the body de-stress from pain and trigger natural, healthy processes necessary for better health.
We are finalizing development of an enhanced version of our Wellness Pro Plus that we intend to market under the name “Wellness Pro Plus Infinity.” This device will include expanded bioelectric modalities, safety, and efficacy. We expect that the Wellness Pro Plus Infinity will be ready for market in fiscal 2023.
WellnessPro POD and Wellness ION Pen
We are planning to bring two new products to market – extending the Wellness Product line: the WellnessPro POD, our first wearable product, and the Wellness ION Pen. We believe that the WellnessPro POD represents an exciting product line expansion as a “clinical-grade” wearable device, that is intended to treat chronic pain, PTSD, anxiety, depression and insomnia. We intend to sell this device over-the-counter; however, some modalities on this device may only be provided with a prescription. Our target market for the 

6



WellnessPro POD is chronic pain sufferers, which is estimated to be 100 million individuals in the United States alone. We intend to focus on various segments in this market, including veterans of U.S. armed forces, which according to the Census Bureau, as of 2014, consists of nearly 22 million individuals. Our goal is to educate the medical community of the benefits of "natural", non-invasive, non-toxic pain relief and for the WellnessPro POD to be an initial choice for practitioners to prescribe separately or in conjunction with pain medication.
Both of these new products will integrate with the WellnessPro Plus to leverage the engineering breakthroughs and intellectual property found in the WellnessPro Plus, and yet will still function as standalone devices.
WellnessPro POD

● | The WellnessPro POD is a compact “clinical-grade” wearable intended to keep pace with the evolution in pain management across practice segments, which will expand the range of treated modalities from chronic and acute pain to include PTSD, anxiety, depression and insomnia.

According to information provided by the American Academy of Pain Medicine, at least 100 million Americans suffer from chronic pain, not including acute pain for children. We believe that Electromedical represents a tested, proven solution for different segments of the population.
We plan to address these individuals directly as well as through their healthcare providers. There are approximately 77,000 chiropractors and 123,000 physiotherapists in the United States. Combined, over 200,000 healthcare practitioners focused on rehabilitation and pain relief – not to mention practitioners involved in sports medicine, natural medicine and pain management.
In addition, we believe there are certain niche markets that our products are well suited to address. As discussed above, we expect that veterans will be the first market for the WellnessPro POD as it addresses the various needs our veteran population is suffering from.
Further, we believe that our products can help provide a solution to the opioid problem. Our current product, the WellnessPro Plus, assists with the recovery from opioid addiction. We believe that the WellnessPro POD will also be highly effective for pain management and relief and could be used as an alternative, or can be prescribed in conjunction with pain medication, to reduce the amount of deaths and addictions due to Opioid abuse and misuse.
Strategy
Electromedical Technologies, for the first fifteen years of its existence, has been fortunate to have grown “organically” without formal sales and marketing programs and investments. We believe this is fundamentally because of the product’s ability to deliver uncommon 

7



levels of pain relief better quality of life and wellness for thousands of customers (our “raving fans”). These raving fans subsequently shared their miraculous stories of recovery – some of which can be found on our website. We believe that those testimonials influenced thousands of people living with ailments and pain to turn to the WellnessPro Plus for relief. These changes in with the additional capital we are planning to raise. In 2023 and beyond, Electromedical will engage in a comprehensive and fully integrated marketing program to increase sales and build the Electromedical brand. The integrated marketing program will include the following elements:
Website marketing.
