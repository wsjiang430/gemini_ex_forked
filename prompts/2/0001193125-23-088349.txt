Item 1. Business. 
Overview 
 We are a blank check company formed on March 24, 2021 as a Delaware corporation whose business purpose is to effect a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. The company has not commenced any operations. All activity for the period March 24, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2022 relates to the Company’s formation and the Initial Public Offering and since the Initial Public Offering to its search for an initial business combination. Based on our business activities, the Company is a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), because we have no operations and assets consisting almost entirely of cash. We are also an emerging growth company and smaller reporting company and, as such, we are subject to all of the risks associated with emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies, respectively. 
 Our objective is to leverage the experience our seasoned Operating Partners have in leading and growing technology-focused organizations in both the public and private markets to effect an initial business combination that delivers value to our stockholders. 
 
3 


 The FLAG team implements a sourcing strategy that leverages the Operating Partners’ extensive network of long-standing relationships to identify potential business combination partners. We seek to undertake a business combination with a company or companies that we believe are likely to benefit from the operational experience and leadership of our collective team. The Operating Partners intend to leverage its substantial industry experience and global relationships with the goal of providing potential business combination partners with benefits that will create long-term value to our stockholders. We believe we can facilitate operational, financial, strategic and managerial improvements in the prospective combination partner company in order to achieve long-term sustainable growth for its stockholders. 
 The six Operating Partners on our team are Thomas A. Vecchiolla, Michael J. Alber, Jeffrey D. MacLauchlan, Michael Papadales, Marybeth A. Wootton and William J. Weber. Each of our Operating Partners, directors and Advisor Partners is a member of a series of our sponsor, First Light Acquisition Group, LLC, a Delaware series limited liability company, and an entity controlled by William J. Weber is the manager of each series of our sponsor. 
 We are not required to complete our initial business combination with a company or companies that provide technology-enabled solutions with high-growth, mission-critical applications in the government and commercial markets. We may pursue (and have pursued) our initial business combination outside of such markets. We may seek to acquire established businesses that we believe are fundamentally sound but potentially in need of financial, operational, strategic or board-level insight to maximize value. We may also look at earlier stage companies that exhibit the potential to change the industries in which they operate, and which may offer the potential of sustained high levels of revenue and earnings growth. 
 Our units, Class A common stock and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act and we have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. The SEC’s internet site (http://www.sec.gov) contains such reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accounting firm. 
 Our executive offices are located at 11110 Sunset Hills Road #2278 Reston, VA 29190 and our telephone number is (202) 503-9255. Our corporate website address is www.firstlightacquisition.com. Our website and the information contained on, or that can be accessed through, the website is not deemed to be incorporated by reference in, and is not considered part of, this annual report. Investors should not rely on any such information in making their decision whether to invest in our securities. 
 Initial Investment of Founder Shares 
 In April 2021, our sponsor and Metric purchased an aggregate of 5,750,000 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.004 per share with (i) our sponsor purchasing an aggregate of 4,605,750 founder shares for a purchase price of $20,025 and (ii) Metric purchasing an aggregate of 1,144,250 founder shares for a purchase price of $4,975. Prior to the initial investment in the company of $25,000 by our sponsor and Metric, the company had no assets, tangible or intangible. 
Private Placement of Warrants 
 Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the private placement of 3,397,155 private placement warrants, at a price of $1.50 per private placement warrant, with our sponsor and Metric, generating gross proceeds of approximately $5,095,733. 
Trust Account 
 Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement, $230,000,000 ($10.00 per unit) of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and certain of the proceeds of the Private Placement were placed in a trust account (“Trust Account”), located in the United States with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and has been invested only in U.S. “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the 
 
4 


 Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (“Investment Company Act”), having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, as determined by us, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a business combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account as described below. 
 On September 13, 2022, the Company held a special meeting of its stockholders (the “Special Meeting”). At the Special Meeting, the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment to the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the date by which the Company must consummate a business combination transaction from September 14, 2022 (the date which was 12 months from the closing date of the Company’s Initial Public Offering of units) to December 14, 2022, following which the board of directors of the Company had the ability to extend for three additional times for three months each time, for a total of nine additional months (the “completion window”) if the sponsor pays an amount equal to 1% of the amount then on deposit in the Trust Account for each three-month extension; provided, that if as of the time of an extension the Company has filed a Form S-4 or F-4 registration statement under the Securities Act or a proxy, information or tender offer statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with such initial business combination, then no Extension Fee would be required in connection with such extension; provided further, that for each three-month extension (if any) following such extension where no deposit into the Trust Account or other payment has been made, the sponsor or its affiliates or designees would be required to deposit into the Trust Account an amount equal to 1% of the amount then on deposit in the Trust Account (the “Charter Amendment Proposal”). As a result, the sponsor deposited $415,625 into the Trust Account. 
 In connection with the Charter Amendment Proposal, stockholders elected to redeem 18,871,976 shares of the Class A common stock. Following such redemptions, 4,128,024 shares of Class A common stock remained issued and outstanding and there was $41,562,580.79 remaining in the Trust Account after giving effect to the redemptions. 
 On December 6, 2022, Guggenheim Securities, the IPO Underwriter, notified FLAG that it had determined to waive its entitlement to the payment of $8,050,000 of deferred compensation in connection with its role as underwriter in Initial Public Offering that would otherwise become due upon the consummation of the Business Combination. 
 On December 14, 2022, the Board approved an extension of the completion window from December 14, 2022 to March 14, 2023 (the “Extension”). In connection with the Extension, the Trust Account was funded with a payment of $415,626. 
 On March 14, 2023, an automatic extension of the completion window from March 14, 2023 to June 14, 2023 occurred pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. 
 Proposed Business Combination 
 On January 9, 2023, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among FLAG, FLAG Merger Sub, Inc., a Nevada corporation and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of FLAG (“Merger Sub”), Calidi Biotherapeutics, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Calidi”), our sponsor, in the capacity as the representative of the stockholders of FLAG and Allan Camaisa, in the capacity as the representative of the stockholders to Calidi. 
 Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the parties thereto will enter into a business combination transaction (the “Business Combination”) pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into Calidi, with Calidi being the surviving corporation in the merger (the “Merger” and, together with the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the “Transactions”). We refer to the new public entity following consummation of the Merger as “New Calidi.” 
 
5 


 The proposed Business Combination is expected to be consummated after the required approval by the stockholders of FLAG and Calidi and the satisfaction of certain other conditions summarized below: 
 At the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), all shares of Calidi common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, with certain exceptions, will be converted into (i) the right to receive shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share of New Calidi (“New Calidi Common Stock”) and (ii) the contingent right to receive Escalation Shares (as defined below). 
 The aggregate consideration to be paid to the securityholders of Calidi (the “Merger Consideration”) (excluding for this purpose options of Calidi that remain unvested immediately following the Merger) will be based on an equity value of Calidi of $250,000,000, subject to adjustment dependent upon (i) the difference in Calidi’s “net debt” as of the Effective Time from a target “net debt” amount (the “Net Debt Adjustment”) and (ii) the achievement of certain pre-closing milestones, if any (as described below). As of the Effective Time, each outstanding Calidi option (whether vested or unvested) will be assumed by FLAG and automatically converted into an option for shares of FLAG Class A Common Stock (the “FLAG Class A Common Stock”). 
 If, during the period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the closing of the Transactions (the “Interim Period”), Calidi enters into a revenue-generating definitive collaboration or out-license contract involving Calidi’s technology (a “Pre-Closing Milestone Contract”), the Merger Consideration will be increased by an amount equal to the aggregate up-front cash payments received by Calidi pursuant to any such Pre-Closing Milestone Contracts. 
 Following the closing of the Transactions (the “Closing”), as additional consideration for the Merger, FLAG will issue shares of New Calidi Common Stock (“Escalation Shares”) to each holder of Calidi common stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (a “Calidi Stockholder”) in accordance with the following terms: 
 If at any time during the five (5) year period following the Closing (the “Escalation Period”), the last reported sale price of the shares of New Calidi Common Stock as reported on the NYSE American (or the exchange on which such shares are listed) for a period for any 20 days within any 30 consecutive day trading period (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like), is: 
 

• | greater than or equal to $12.00, each former Calidi Stockholder will be entitled to receive its pro rata share of 4,500,000 shares of New Calidi Common Stock;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | greater than or equal to $14.00, each former Calidi Stockholder will be entitled to receive its pro rata share of 4,500,000 shares of New Calidi Common Stock;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | greater than or equal to $16.00, each former Calidi Stockholder will be entitled to receive its pro rata share of 4,500,000 shares of New Calidi Common Stock; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | greater than or equal to $18.00, each former Calidi Stockholder will be entitled to receive its pro rata share of 4,500,000 shares of New Calidi Common Stock.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 If, during the Escalation Period, there is a change of control pursuant to which FLAG or its stockholders have the right to receive consideration implying a value per share that is equal to or in excess of the above price targets, there will be an acceleration of the Escalation Period at the applicable target price. 
 To incentivize FLAG public stockholders not to redeem their shares, up to 2 million shares of New Calidi Common Stock will be made available to non-redeeming FLAG public stockholders on a pro rata basis at Closing (the “Non-Redeeming Continuation Shares”). For example, if a public stockholder owns 10% of the outstanding shares of New Calidi Common Stock prior to the redemption deadline, and such holder elects not to redeem its shares resulting in a pro rata release of freely useable cash to New Calidi, such holder will be entitled to up to 200,000. 
 The Escalation Shares will be placed in escrow and will be outstanding from and after the Closing, subject to cancellation if the applicable price targets are not achieved. While in escrow, the shares will be non-voting. In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, FLAG entered into Voting and Lock-Up Agreements (the “Voting and Lock-Up Agreement”) with certain holders of Calidi common stock (each, a “Significant Company Holder”). Pursuant to each Voting and Lock-Up Agreement, each Significant Company Holder agreed to, among other things, (a) execute and deliver an irrevocable written consent approving (i) the Merger Agreement, Transaction Agreements and the Transactions (including the Merger) and (ii) any other matters necessary or appropriate in order to effect the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement within 15 business days following the time the Registration Statement is declared effective and (b) be bound by certain transfer restrictions with respect to the New Calidi Common Stock received by them in the Merger following the closing of the Transactions. 
 In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, FLAG, Calidi, the sponsor, Metric and the directors and officers of FLAG entered into the Sponsor Agreement (“Sponsor Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, the sponsor, Metric and 
 
6 


  the directors and officers of FLAG agreed, among other things, (a) to vote any shares of common stock held by such party in favor of the Business Combination proposal and other proposals to be presented to FLAG stockholders at the FLAG special meeting, (b) not to redeem any shares of Class A common stock or Class B common stock in connection with the redemption, (c) to be bound by certain lock-up restrictions with respect to the Class A common stock of each holder from and after the Merger, and (d) to make available certain Class B common stock and private placement warrants of FLAG to incentivize PIPE investors between signing and closing of the Transactions. 
 In connection with the Transactions, FLAG, Calidi, the sponsor, Metric, the Significant Company Holders and certain other parties thereto agreed to enter into the Registration Rights Agreement (“Registration Rights Agreement”) upon the consummation of the Transactions, pursuant to which, holders and their permitted transferees will have the right to require FLAG immediately following the Merger Agreement, at New Calidi’s expense, to (a) file a registration statement in respect of the resale of the FLAG Class A Common Stock that they hold within 30 business days following the closing date of the Transactions and on customary terms for a transaction of this type, and (b) customary registration rights, including demand, piggy-back and shelf registration rights. 
 For additional information regarding Calidi, the Business Combination and the Transactions contemplated thereby, see the registration statement on Form S-4 containing a preliminary proxy statement/prospectus of Calidi initially filed with the SEC on February 10, 2023 (the “proxy statement/prospectus”). 
 Other than as specifically discussed, this report does not assume the closing of the Business Combination. 
 Business Strategy 
 Our business strategy is to identify and transact with a company in one or more of the core markets where we have significant operational and investment experience alongside deep relationships. We believe management teams of prospective combination partners will benefit from the “know-how” of our experienced team and additional capital from the potential transaction. 
 
7 


 Investment Criteria 
 Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating potential business combination partners. While we have used these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, if we do not consummate the Business Combination with Calidi, we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a potential business partner that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We will continue to seek to acquire companies that we believe: 

• | Have proprietary technologies;
--+-------------------------------


• | Have market-disruptive applications with multiple current or potential use-cases, including commercial and/or defense markets;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Provide solutions in large, identifiable, and fast-growing end markets;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Have strong, visionary management and leadership teams with the ability to execute value-enhancing business strategies;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Have demonstrated success or are “on the precipice” of achieving success in an identifiable core market(s)—either government or commercial—that extend to adjacent markets where the proprietary technologies have natural application in the medium- to long-term;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Can benefit from being domiciled in the U.S., which will enable it to expand market share and customer base;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Can leverage the collective expertise, experience and relationships of the FLAG team within government and commercial industries in order to spur growth and bolster its readiness to become a publicly traded company;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Have defensible market positions or are able to chart a course to creating a market with high barriers to entry; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Have valuations that we believe make them attractive relative to comparable publicly traded companies and are positioned to create further value via bolt-on acquisitions as a platform for further growth and through general business improvements post-closing.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These general criteria and guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general criteria and guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that the FLAG team may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a potential business partner that we believe does not meet the above general criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the business partner does not meet the above general criteria and guidelines in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the SEC. 
 Initial Business Combination 
 So long as our securities are listed on the NYSE American, an initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of our assets held in the Trust Account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting discount held in trust). If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) or an independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make such independent determination of fair market value, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of 
 
8 


 the target’s assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the board of directors determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. As any such opinion, if obtained, would only state that the fair market value meets the 80% of net assets threshold, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of the target or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed to our stockholders. However, if required by Schedule 14A of the Exchange Act, any proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we will file with the SEC in connection with our initial business combination will include such opinion. 
 We anticipate structuring our initial business combination, including the Business Combination with Calidi, so that the post-business combination company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-business combination company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. 
 Even if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-business combination company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of the NYSE American’s 80% of fair market value test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as our initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable. In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our sponsor. 
 The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. We may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although the Operating Partners will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure stockholders that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors. 
 Effecting Our Initial Business Combination 
 We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the private placement of the private placement warrants, the proceeds of the sale of our shares and warrants in connection with our initial business combination, shares issued to the owners of the target, debt or a combination of the foregoing. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses. 
 If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination or used for redemptions of purchases of our Class A common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the Trust Account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-business combination company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. 
 
9 


 In addition to the forward purchase securities, we may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination, and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering in addition to or in lieu of the amounts held in the Trust Account. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would expect to complete such financing only simultaneously with the consummation of our business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the Trust Account assets, our proxy solicitation or tender offer materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. 
 Sources of Target Businesses 
 Should we not consummate the Business Combination with Calidi, we anticipate that target business candidates will continue to be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity groups, venture capital firms, investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we would expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent the FLAG team determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our Operating Partners determine is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of a finder’s fee is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the Trust Account. In no event, however, will our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which they are affiliated, be paid any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). We have the option to pay our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for administrative support and services and to reimburse our sponsor for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigation and completing an initial business combination. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-business combination company following our initial business combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an acquisition candidate. 
 We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business combination partner that is affiliated with our sponsor or any member of the FLAG team, or from making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor or any member of the FLAG team. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business combination partner that is affiliated with our sponsor or any member of the FLAG team, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. 
 
10 


 If any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Our officers and directors currently have certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us. 
 Evaluation of a Target Business and Structuring of Our Initial Business Combination 
 In evaluating a prospective target business, we conduct a thorough due diligence review which encompasses, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as applicable, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information about the target and its industry that will be made available to us. We also utilize our management team’s operational and capital planning experience. 
 Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. The Company will not pay any consulting fees to members of our management team, or their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our initial business combination. In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our sponsor. 
 Lack of Business Diversification 
 For an indefinite period of time after the consummation of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. 
 Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may: 
 

• | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team 
 Although we closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business, including the management team of Calidi, when evaluating the desirability of effecting our business combination with that business, and plan to continue to do so if the Business Combination with Calidi is not consummated and we seek other business combination opportunities, our assessment of the target business’s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, should we not consummate the Business Combination with Calidi, the future role of members of the FLAG team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure stockholders that members of the FLAG team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business. 
 
11 


 We cannot assure stockholders that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. 
 Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure stockholders that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management. 
 Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination 
 We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, subject to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule (as is the case for the Business Combination with Calidi), or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of initial business combinations we may consider and whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law for each such transaction. 

Type of transaction | Whether stockholder approval is required
Purchase of assets | No 
Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company | No 
Merger of target into a subsidiary of the company | No 
Merger of the company with a target | Yes 

 Under Section 712(b) of the NYSE American Company Guide, stockholder approval is required prior to the issuance of common stock, or of securities convertible into common stock, in which the sales, issuance or potential issuance is equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding before the issuance of the common stock or securities convertible into common stock. 
 Under Section 713(b) of the NYSE American Company Guide, stockholder approval is required prior to the issuance or potential issuance of additional shares which will result in a change of control, including in connection with a reverse merger as defined in the NYSE American rules. 
 Permitted Purchases and Other Transactions with Respect to Our Securities 
 In the event we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase public shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the consummation of our initial business combination. In the event our initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates determine to make any such purchases at the time of a stockholder vote relating to our initial business combination, such purchases could have the effect of influencing the vote necessary to approve such transaction. None of the funds held in the Trust Account will be used to purchase public shares or public warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such stockholder, although still the record holder of our shares, is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. Subsequent to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, we will adopt an insider trading policy which will require insiders to refrain from purchasing shares during certain blackout periods and when they are in possession of any material non-public information. In addition, such policy will require insiders to clear all trades with our Chief Financial Officer (or his/her designee) prior to execution. We cannot currently determine whether our insiders will make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan, as such purchases will be dependent upon several factors, including 
 
12 


  but not limited to, the timing and size of such purchases. Depending on such circumstances, our insiders may either make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or determine that such a plan is not necessary. 
 In the event that our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors, Metric or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights or submitted a proxy to vote against our initial business combination, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares and any proxy to vote against our initial business combination. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. 
 The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be (i) to vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the business combination or (ii) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the consummation of our business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. 
 In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our Class A common stock or our public warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. 
 
13 


 Our sponsor, officers, directors, Metric and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the stockholders with whom our sponsor, officers, directors, Metric or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by stockholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the Trust Account or vote against the initial business combination, whether or not such stockholders has already submitted a proxy with respect to our initial business combination but only if such shares have not already been voted at the stockholder meeting related to our initial business combination. Our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates will select which stockholders to purchase shares from based on the negotiated price and number of shares and any other factors that they may deem relevant, and will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws. 
 Any purchases by our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will only be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will not make purchases of common stock if such purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements. 
 Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination 
 We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of our Class A common stock upon the consummation of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, including franchise and income taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the Trust Account is initially anticipated to be approximately $10.00 per public share. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial owner must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. There will be no redemption rights upon the consummation of our initial business combination with respect to our warrants. Our sponsor, officers, directors and Metric have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed (i) to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares held by them and any public shares they may have acquired during and after the Initial Public Offering in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination and a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would modify (A) the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of shares of our Class A common stock the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not consummate our initial business combination within 15 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (or up to 24 months if we were to exercise the three three-month extensions available to us pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provided that our sponsor pays the Extension Fee, which amount shall be deposited in the Trust Account, and further provided that if we enter into a merger, acquisition or other business combination agreement in connection with the initial Business Combination, the subsequent two three-month extensions will occur automatically without requiring the sponsor to pay the Extension Fee) or (B) any other provision relating to the rights of holders of shares of our Class A common stock or pre-initial business combination activity and (ii) to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any founder shares they hold if we fail to consummate an initial business combination within 15 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (or up to 24 months if we were to exercise the three three-month extensions available to us pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, provided that the sponsor pays the Extension Fee) which amount shall be deposited in the Trust Account (although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any public shares they hold if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame). The anchor investors have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares held by them in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination and to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any founder shares they hold if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within 15 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, or during any Extension Period, (although with respect to any public shares they hold they will be entitled to redemption rights in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination or liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame). 
 
14 


 Limitations on Redemptions 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets (as determined in accordance with Rule 3a51-1(g)(1) of the Exchange Act), to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of the underwriter’s fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). However, a greater net tangible asset or cash requirement may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of our Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceeds the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of our Class A common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. 
Manner of Conducting Redemptions 
 We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of our Class A common stock upon the consummation of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the business combination, such as is the case with the Business Combination with Calidi, or (ii) by means of a tender offer. In the case of a stockholder meeting, such election must be made, unless extended by us in our sole discretion, no later than two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the initial business combination. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval, while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our issued and outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval. If we structure a business combination transaction with a target business in a manner that requires stockholder approval, we will not have discretion as to whether to seek a stockholder vote to approve the proposed business combination. We currently intend to conduct redemptions in connection with a stockholder vote unless stockholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements and we choose to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC for business or other legal reasons. 
 If we hold a stockholder vote to approve our initial business combination, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation: 
 

• | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

 In the event that we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon consummation of the initial business combination. 
 If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the Company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our initial stockholders will count toward this quorum. Pursuant to the terms of letter agreements entered into with us, our sponsor, officers and directors and Metric have agreed to vote any founder shares held by them and any public shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of our initial business 
 
15 


 combination. Pursuant to the terms of investment agreements entered into with us, the anchor investors have agreed to vote any founder shares held by them in favor of our initial business combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding shares of common stock voted, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our initial business combination once a quorum is obtained. As a result, where the majority of the outstanding shares of common stock is required to approve our initial business combination, our sponsor, Metric, the anchor investors and Insiders control enough of the Company’s voting power that we would be able to approve our initial business combination without the approval of any holders of our public shares. We will give at least 10 days prior written notice of any such meeting, if required, at which a vote shall be taken to approve our initial business combination. These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our initial stockholders, may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its public shares irrespective of whether it votes for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our sponsor, officers, directors and Metric have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection with (i) the consummation of a business combination and (ii) a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination within 15 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (or up to 24 months if we were to exercise the three three-month extensions available to us pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, of which one extension remains unexercised). The anchor investors have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares held by them in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination. 
 If stockholder approval of the transaction is not required by law or stock exchange listing requirements and we do not decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation: 
 

• | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about our initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. Although we are not required to do so, we currently intend to comply with the substantive and procedural requirements of Regulation 14A in connection with any stockholder vote even if we are not able to maintain our NYSE American listing or Exchange Act registration.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Upon the public announcement of our business combination, we or our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our Class A common stock in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, in order to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act. 
 In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than the number of public shares we are permitted to redeem. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination.

 Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination If We Seek Stockholder Approval 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of our public shares included in the units sold in the Initial Public Offering, which we refer to as the “Excess Shares,” without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or the FLAG team to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of our public shares included in the units sold in the Initial Public Offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us, our sponsor or the FLAG team at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our public stockholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of our public shares included in the units sold in the Initial Public Offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our business combination. 
Tendering Share Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights 
 As described above, we may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to, at the holder’s option, either tender their stock certificates to our transfer agent or deliver their shares to our transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) system, prior to the date set forth in the proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable. In the case of proxy materials, this date may be up to two business days prior to the date on which the vote on the proposal to approve the initial business combination is initially to be held. In addition, if we conduct redemptions in connection with a stockholder vote, we intend to require a public stockholder seeking redemption of its public shares to also submit a written request for redemption to our transfer agent two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote in which the name and other identifying information of the beneficial owner of such shares is included. The proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the initial business combination if we distribute proxy materials, or from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, as applicable, to submit or tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. In the event that a stockholder fails to comply with these or any other procedures disclosed in the proxy or tender offer materials, as applicable, its shares may not be redeemed. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares. 
 There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC system. The transfer agent will typically charge the broker submitting or tendering shares a fee of approximately $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to submit or tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. 
 The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders’ vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an “option window” after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company’s shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his 
 
17 


  or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the general meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming stockholder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved. 
 Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the consummation of our initial business combination. 
 If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered, or shares tendered electronically, by public stockholders who elected to redeem their shares. 
 If our initial proposed initial business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete an initial business combination with a different target until 15 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (or up to 24 months if we were to exercise the three three-month extensions available to us pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, of which one extension remains unexercised) from the closing of the Initial Public Offering. 
 Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation If No Initial Business Combination 
 Our sponsor, executive officers and directors have agreed that we will have only 15 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (or up to 24 months if we were to exercise the three three-month extensions available to us pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, of which one extension remains unexercised) from the closing of the Initial Public Offering to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within such 15-month period (subject to our ability to seek an extension of such period), we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of our public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, including franchise and income taxes (less up to $100,000 of such net interest released to us to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the total number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish the public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law; and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the 15-month time period (or up to the 24-month period if we were to exercise the three three-month extensions available to us pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, of which one extension remains unexercised). 
 Our sponsor, officers, directors and Metric have entered into letter agreements with us, and the anchor investors have entered into investment agreements with us, in each case, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any founder shares held by them if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 15 months (or up to 24 months if we were to exercise the three three-month extensions available to us pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, of which one extension remains unexercised) from the closing of the Initial Public Offering. However, if our sponsor, officers, directors, Metric or the anchor investors acquired public shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the allotted 15-month time period (or up to the 24-month time period if we were to exercise the three three-month extensions available to us pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, of which one extension remains unexercised). 
 Our sponsor, officers, directors and Metric have agreed, pursuant to letter agreements with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of shares of our Class A common stock the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not 
 
18 


  complete our initial business combination within 15 months (or up to 24 months if we were to exercise the three three-month extensions available to us pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, of which one extension remains unexercised) from the closing of the Initial Public Offering or any other provision relating to the rights of holders of shares of our Class A common stock or pre-initial business combination activity, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of our Class A common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, including franchise and income taxes (less up to $100,000 of such net interest released to us to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of the then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets (as determined in accordance with Rule 3a51-1(g)(1) of the Exchange Act) to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of the underwriter’s fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). 
 Costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will need to be funded from amounts remaining out of funds held outside the Trust Account. Absent additional funding, or accommodations by our creditors, the funds are insufficient to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the Trust Account not required to pay franchise and income taxes on interest income earned on the Trust Account balance, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses. 
 If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the Trust Account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the Trust Account, the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure stockholders that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than $10.00. Under Section 281(b) of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure stockholders that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims. 
 Although we have sought and continue to seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements at the time of their engagement waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account for the benefit of our public stockholders, not all have and there is no guarantee that in the future all such persons will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the Trust Account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the Trust Account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account, the Operating Partners will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if the Operating Partners believe that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by the Operating Partners to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where the Operating Partners are unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. 
 In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for any reason. Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay our taxes, including franchise and income taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of 
 
19 


  any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriter of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, then our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations. Therefore, we cannot assure stockholders that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the Trust Account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and public stockholders would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of their public shares. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. 
 In the event that the proceeds in the Trust Account are reduced below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so if, for example, the cost of such legal action is deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or if the independent directors determine that a favorable outcome is not likely. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations and we cannot assure stockholders that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. Accordingly, we cannot assure stockholders that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.00 per public share. 
 We will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements at the time of their engagement waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriter of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We have access to up to approximately $2,760,675 from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement warrants with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our dissolution, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our Trust Account could be liable for claims made by creditors. 
 Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our Trust Account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our business combination within 15 months (or up to 24 months if we were to exercise the three three-month extensions available to us pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, of which one extension remains unexercised) from the closing of the Initial Public Offering may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. 
 Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our Trust Account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our business combination within 15 months (or up to 24 months if we were to exercise the three three-month extensions available to us pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, of which one extension remains unexercised) from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is

  deemed to be unlawful (potentially due to the imposition of legal proceedings that a party may bring or due to the other circumstances that are currently unknown), then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution. If we are unable to complete our business combination within 15 months (or up to 24 months if we were to exercise the three three-month extensions available to us pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, of which one extension remains unexercised) from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (subject to our ability to seek an extension of such period), we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of our public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, including franchise and income taxes (less up $100,000 of such net interest released to us to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the total number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish the public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law; and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following the date which is 15 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (or as late as the date which is 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering if we were to exercise the three three-month extensions available to us pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, of which one extension remains unexercised) and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date. 
 Because we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements at the time of their engagement waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account. As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the Trust Account is remote. Further, our sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the Trust Account are not reduced below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest withdrawn to pay our taxes, including franchise and income taxes, and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriter of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. 
 If we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy or insolvency law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust Account, we cannot assure our public stockholders that we will be able to return $10.00 per share to them. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy/insolvency laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy or insolvency court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure stockholders that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.

 Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the Trust Account only upon the earliest to occur of: (a) the consummation of our initial business combination, and then only in connection with those shares of our Class A common stock that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described herein, (b) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify (i) the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of shares of our Class A common stock the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 15 months (or up to 24 months if we were to exercise the three three-month extensions available to us pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, of which one extension remains unexercised) from the closing of the Initial Public Offering or (ii) any other provision relating to the rights of holders of shares of our Class A common stock or pre-initial business combination activity, and (c) the redemption of our public shares if we have not consummated our business combination within 15 months (or up to 24 months if we were to exercise the three three-month extensions available to us pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, of which one extension remains unexercised) from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, subject to applicable law. Public stockholders who redeem their shares of our Class A common stock in connection with a stockholder vote described in clause (b) in the preceding sentence shall not be entitled to funds from the Trust Account upon the subsequent consummation of an initial business combination or liquidation if we have not completed an initial business combination within 15 months (or up to 24 months if we were to exercise the three three-month extensions available to us pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, of which one extension remains unexercised) from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, with respect to such shares of our Class A common stock so redeemed. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the Trust Account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a stockholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a stockholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. These provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, like all provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, may be amended with a stockholder vote. 
 Facilities 
 Our address is 11110 Sunset Hills Road #2278, Reston, VA 20190, and our telephone number is (202) 503-9255. The cost for our use of this location is included in the $10,000 per month fee that we have pay to our sponsor for administrative support and services. We consider our current arrangements adequate for our current operations. 
 Human Capital/Employees 
 We currently have two officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that they will devote in any time period varies based on the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination. 
 Competition 
 In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our business combination, we have encountered and expect to continue to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Should we not consummate the Business Combination with Calidi, our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.

 Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company 
 We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act,” reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 
 In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the Initial Public Offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion (as adjusted for inflation pursuant to SEC rules from time to time), or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A common stock that are held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, or (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” will have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act. 
 Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of the shares of our Class A common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $250 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, or (2) our annual revenues equals or exceeds $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of the shares of our Class A common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter. To the extent we take advantage of such reduced disclosure obligations, it may also make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies difficult or impossible.
