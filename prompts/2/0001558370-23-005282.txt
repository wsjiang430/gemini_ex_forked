Late Stage Product Candidates
Cosibelimab (Anti-PD-L1 mAb for CSCC)
Our partner company Checkpoint is currently evaluating its lead product candidate, cosibelimab, an anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (“PD-L1”) antibody licensed from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, in an ongoing global, open-label, multicohort Phase 1 clinical trial in checkpoint therapy-naïve patients with selected recurrent or metastatic cancers, including ongoing cohorts in locally advanced and metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (“CSCC”) intended to support one or more applications for marketing approval. Based on top-line and interim results in metastatic and locally advanced CSCC, respectively, Checkpoint submitted a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for these indications in January 2023, which application is filed and under review with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) goal date of January 3, 2024. Additional information on the Phase 1 trial can be found on ClinicalTrials.gov using identifier NCT03212404. The information contained on this website is not included in, or incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
​
In June 2022, Checkpoint announced interim results from a registration-enabling cohort of our multi-regional, Phase 1 clinical trial of cosibelimab in patients with locally advanced CSCC that are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation. Cosibelimab demonstrated a confirmed objective response rate (“ORR”) of 54.8% (95% CI: 36.0, 72.7) based on independent central review of 31 patients enrolled in the cohort using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (“RECIST 1.1”).
​
In January 2022, Checkpoint announced top-line results from a registration-enabling cohort of our multi-regional, Phase 1 clinical trial of cosibelimab in patients with metastatic CSCC. The cohort met its primary endpoint, with cosibelimab demonstrating a confirmed ORR of 47.4% (95% CI: 36.0, 59.1) based on independent central review of 78 patients enrolled in the metastatic CSCC cohort using RECIST 1.1.
​
Checkpoint also has a collaboration agreement with TG Therapeutics, Inc. (“TGTX”) whereby TGTX was granted the rights to develop and commercialize cosibelimab in the field of hematological malignancies, while Checkpoint retains the right to develop and commercialize these assets in solid tumors.

In December 2021, Checkpoint announced the initiation of its’ CONTERNO study, a multi-regional, open-label, multi-center, randomized Phase 3 trial of cosibelimab in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”). The February 2022 invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing response disrupted our ability to conduct clinical trials in the region. The substantially longer enrollment period in other planned countries made the conduct of the CONTERNO study no longer viable. Accordingly, Checkpoint expects that the study will be wound down and closed by the end of the first quarter of 2023.

CUTX-101 (Copper Histidinate injection for Menkes Disease)
​
Our partner company Cyprium is currently developing CUTX-101, a copper histidinate injection for the treatment of Menkes disease. Menkes disease is a rare X-linked pediatric disease caused by gene mutations of copper transporter ATP7A, which affects approximately 1 in 34,810 live male births, and potentially as high as 1 in 8,664 live male births, based on a recent genome-based ascertainment study. Menkes disease is characterized by distinctive clinical features, including sparse and depigmented hair (“kinky hair”), failure to thrive, connective tissue disorders and severe neurological symptoms such as seizures and hypotonia. Biochemically, Menkes patients may have low serum copper levels, as well as abnormal levels of catecholamine, but definitive diagnosis is typically made by sequencing of the ATP7A gene. There is no current FDA-approved treatment for Menkes disease. CUTX-101, along with an AAV-ATP7A gene therapy that is also being developed by Cyprium, was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products. CUTX-101 was also granted Rare Pediatric Disease Designation by the FDA for the treatment of Menkes disease, Fast Track Designation for classic Menkes disease in patients who have not demonstrated significant clinical progression, and Breakthrough Therapy Designation. 
​
In August 2020, Cyprium reported positive top-line clinical efficacy results for CUTX-101. The study demonstrated statistically significant improvement in overall survival for Menkes disease subjects who received early treatment (ET) with CUTX-101, compared to an untreated historical control (HC) cohort, with a nearly 80% reduction in the risk of death (Hazard Ratio = 0.21, p<0.0001). Median survival for the ET cohort was 14.8 years (177.1 months) compared to 1.3 years (15.9 months) for the untreated HC cohort. 
​
Cyprium also continues to asses and enroll prospective patients into its Intermediate-Size Patient Population Expanded Access Protocol. Additional information on the Expanded Access study and requirements can be found on ClinicalTrials.gov using identifier NCT04074512. 
 ​
In February 2021, Cyprium announced the execution of an asset purchase agreement with Sentynl, a U.S.-based specialty pharmaceutical company owned by the Zydus Group. Pursuant to the asset purchase agreement, Sentynl paid Cyprium an upfront fee of $8.0 million upon execution, and Cyprium remains eligible to receive up to $12.0 million in additional future development cash milestones through New Drug Application (“NDA”) approval. Cyprium is also eligible to receive up to $255.0 million in sales milestone payments (payable pursuant to five separate milestones). Royalties on CUTX-101 net sales ranging from the mid-single digits up to the mid-twenties are also payable. All of the foregoing milestone and royalty payments are subject to 50% diminution in the event Sentynl decides, at its option, to assume development control of CUTX-101 during the 45-day period beginning on September 30, 2023. Under the asset purchase agreement, Cyprium retains development responsibility of CUTX-101 (subject to the aforementioned right by Sentynl to assume development) and Sentynl will be responsible for commercialization of CUTX-101 as well as progressing newborn screening activities. Continued development of CUTX-101 is overseen by a Joint Steering Committee consisting of representatives from Cyprium and Sentynl. Cyprium will in any event retain 100% ownership over any FDA priority review voucher that may be issued at NDA approval for CUTX-101. 
In October 2021, Cyprium announced positive results from an efficacy and safety analysis of data integrated from two completed pivotal studies in patients with Menkes disease treated with CUTX-101, copper histidinate (CuHis). These data were presented as a virtual poster at the 2021 American Academy of Pediatrics National Conference & Exhibition.
On December 7, 2021, Cyprium announced the initiation of a rolling submission of its NDA to the FDA for CUTX-101 for the treatment of Menkes disease. Cyprium expects the rolling submission to complete in 2023.
​
Cyprium is currently in a dispute with its contract manufacturing organization (the “CMO”), regarding the CMO’s attempt to terminate a Master Services Agreement (together with related work orders, the “MSA”) between Cyprium and the CMO. Cyprium believes the CMO’s grounds for purporting to terminate the MSA are without merit and is currently availing itself of all appropriate legal remedies in efforts to ensure that the CMO abides by its obligations under the MSA and/or to pursue monetary damages claims against the CMO.  To that end, Cyprium obtained a temporary restraining order in August 2022 and a preliminary injunction in September 2022 from a court in New York State; the injunction invalidated the CMO’s attempted termination of the MSA and prohibited the CMO from further attempts to terminate the MSA during the pendency of dispute resolution procedures, which are ongoing.

​
Intravenous (IV) Tramadol
Our partner company Avenue is developing intravenous Tramadol (“IV Tramadol”), for the treatment of post-operative acute pain. Avenue completed two Phase 3 efficacy studies in 2018 and 2019 and announced that both had met their primary endpoints and all key secondary endpoints. In December 2019, Avenue submitted an NDA for IV Tramadol to treat moderate to moderately severe postoperative pain pursuant to Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), and following a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”) received in October 2020, resubmitted the NDA in February 2021. In August 2021 Avenue submitted a formal dispute resolution request (“FDRR”), of which we received notice of denial in March 2022 after an Advisory Committee meeting in February 2022. Avenue then participated in a Type A Meeting with the FDA in August 2022, which resulted in a collaborative discussion on study design and a potential path forward. Avenue incorporated the FDA’s suggestions from the meeting minutes and submitted a detailed study protocol that could form the basis for the submission of a complete response to the Second CRL. Avenue announced on March 8, 2023 that the Company would participate in a Type C meeting with the FDA on March 9, 2023 to discuss a proposed study protocol to assess the risk of respiratory depression related to opioid stacking on IV Tramadol relative to an approved opioid analgesic and continues to evaluate next steps with regard to IV Tramadol.
MB-107 and MB-207 (Ex vivo Lentiviral Therapy for X-linked Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (“XSCID”))
Our partner company Mustang collaborates with St. Jude in the development of a first-in-class ex vivo lentiviral gene therapy for the treatment of XSCID, also known as bubble boy disease. In August 2018, Mustang entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with St. Jude for the development of this therapy. XSCID is the most common form of severe combined immune deficiency. This gene therapy is currently in two Phase 1/2 clinical trials involving two different autologous cell products: a multicenter trial of the MB-107 product in newly diagnosed infants sponsored by St. Jude (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01512888) and a single-center trial of the MB-207 product in previously transplanted patients sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01306019). 
​
MB-107 (for newly diagnosed infants with XSCID)
​
Interim Phase 1/2 data on treatment of newly diagnosed infants under the age of two with MB-107 were updated at an oral presentation at the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy 25th Annual Meeting in May 2022. All patients were alive with stable vector marking in all cell lineages, and no evidence of clonal expansion or malignant transformation was observed. 
​
In May 2020, Mustang submitted an Investigational New Product Drug Application (“IND”) application with the FDA to initiate a pivotal non-randomized multicenter Phase 2 clinical trial of MB-107 in newly diagnosed infants with XSCID who are under the age of two. In response, the FDA identified Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (“CMC”) hold issues that Mustang satisfactorily addressed in a December 2020 submission to the Agency, and the CMC hold was removed in January 2021. 
MB-107 has received Orphan Drug Designation and Rare Pediatric Disease, and Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (“RMAT”) designations from the FDA. EMA has granted to MB-107 Priority Medicines (“PRIME”) designation, Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product (“ATMP”) classification, and Orphan Drug Designation.
​
MB-207 (for previously transplanted patients with XSCID)
​
The most recent peer-reviewed presentation of data from the MB-207 trial at the NIH occurred at the 61st Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology in December 2019. With the exception of one patient who died of a pre-existing lung condition after full immune reconstitution, all patients were alive with stable vector marking in all cell lineages, and no evidence of clonal expansion or malignant transformation was observed. In February 2021, Mustang announced an encouraging clinical update from this trial, including consistent safety and efficacy data. 
​
Mustang filed an IND in the fourth quarter of 2021 for a pivotal non-randomized multicenter Phase 2 clinical trial of MB-207 in previously transplanted XSCID patients. In January 2022, the FDA issued a hold, pending CMC clearance, on Mustang’s IND application.

The FDA has granted MB-207 Rare Pediatric Disease Designation and Orphan Drug Designation. The EMA has granted ATMP classification and Orphan Drug Designation to MB-207.
​
Olafertinib (also known as CK-101, EGFR inhibitor for EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC)
Checkpoint is currently evaluating a lead small-molecule, targeted anti-cancer agent, olafertinib, as an oral, third-generation, irreversible kinase inhibitor against selective mutations of epidermal growth factor receptors (“EGFR”) for the potential treatment of adult patients with metastatic NSCLC, whose tumors have EGFR exon 19 deletion mutations. Checkpoint believes that olafertinib has the potential to be effective in this population as a monotherapy or in combination with other anti-tumor immune response potentiating compounds. Olafernitib has FDA Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC.
In September 2018, Checkpoint announced preliminary interim safety and efficacy data from the ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial. The data were presented in an oral presentation at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (“IASLC”) 19th World Conference on Lung Cancer in Toronto. Additional information on the Phase 1 trial can be found on ClinicalTrials.gov using identifier NCT02926768.
In November 2020, NeuPharma, Inc. commenced a Phase 3 clinical trial in China evaluating olafertinib in treatment-naïve locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients whose tumors have EGFR exon 19 deletion mutations. Checkpoint has met with the FDA to discuss the adequacy of the ongoing Phase 3 trial in China.
​
CAEL-101 (Light Chain Fibril-reactive Monoclonal Antibody for AL Amyloidosis)
Our former subsidiary Caelum, in collaboration with AstraZeneca plc (“AstraZeneca”), is working to develop a novel, first-in-class monoclonal antibody called CAEL-101 for the treatment of amyloid light chain (“AL”) amyloidosis. CAEL-101 is designed to improve organ function by reducing or eliminating amyloid deposits in the tissues and organs of patients with AL amyloidosis. The antibody is designed to bind to insoluble light chain amyloid protein, including both kappa and lambda subtypes and received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA as a therapy for patients with AL amyloidosis, and as a radio-imaging agent in AL amyloidosis. CAEL-101 is currently in two Phase 3 trials for AL amyloidosis and additional information on those trials can be found at ClinicalTrials.gov using identifiers: NCT04512235 and NCT04504825.
In October 2021, AstraZeneca acquired Caelum for an upfront payment of approximately $150 million paid to Caelum shareholders, of which approximately $56.9 million was paid to Fortress, which was net of the ten percent, 24-month escrow holdback amount and other miscellaneous transaction expenses. The agreement also provides for additional potential payments to Caelum shareholders totaling up to $350 million, payable upon the achievement of regulatory and commercial milestones. Fortress is eligible to receive 42.4% of all possible proceeds of the transaction, totaling up to approximately $212 million.

Triplex (Vaccine for Cytomegalovirus) 
Through our subsidiary Helocyte, we are developing Triplex, a universal recombinant Modified Vaccinia Ankara viral vector vaccine engineered to induce a rapid, robust and durable virus-specific T cell response to three immuno-dominant proteins (UL83 (pp65), UL123 (IE1), and UL122 (IE2)) linked to cytomegalovirus (“CMV”) complications in the transplant setting. In a Phase 1 study, Triplex was found to be safe, well-tolerated and highly immunogenic when administered to healthy volunteers at multiple dose levels (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01941056). In a Phase 2 trial, Triplex was observed to be safe, well-tolerated, highly immunogenic and efficacious in reducing CMV events in allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02506933). Triplex is currently the subject of four, grant-funded trials in various clinical settings including: adults undergoing stem cell transplant; adults co-infected with CMV and HIV; and in combination with a CAR T cell therapy for adults with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (“NHL”). Helocyte secured an exclusive, worldwide license to Triplex from City of Hope National Medical Center (“COH”) in April 2015. Helocyte secured an exclusive, worldwide license to Triplex from City of Hope National Medical Center (“COH”) in April of 2015.
In December 2021, Helocyte announced that a Phase 2 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial was initiated to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Triplex, a CMV vaccine, in eliciting a CMV-specific immune response and reducing CMV replication in people living with HIV. The trial is being conducted by the AIDS Clinical Trials Group and is funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, part of the National Institutes of Health. 
In August 2022, Helocyte announced that Triplex had received a grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health that could provide over $20 million in non-dilutive funding. This competitive award will fund a multi-center, placebo-controlled, randomized Phase 2 study of Triplex for control of CMV in patients undergoing liver transplantation. The company believes this data set could ultimately be used to support approval of Triplex in this setting. The trial is expected to commence in 2023.
​
CEVA101 (Cellular Therapeutic for Severe Traumatic Brain Injury) 
​
Through our subsidiary Cellvation, we are developing CEVA101, a cellular product comprised of autologous Bone Marrow-derived Mononuclear Cells currently being developed for the treatment of severe traumatic brain injury (“TBI”) in adults and children. In separate Phase 1 trials of adults and children with severe TBI, CEVA101 was observed to be safe, well-tolerated and efficacious (resulting in volumetric preservation versus time-matched controls, and in the case of children, reducing the Pediatric Intensity Level of Therapy or PILOT score, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT01575470 and NCT0254722).
In a randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center Phase 2 study of children with severe TBI completed in November 2020, CEVA101 was similarly observed to be safe, well-tolerated and efficacious (resulting in volumetric preservation and a reduction in the PILOT score of those receiving CEVA101 versus those receiving placebo), (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01851083). A randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study of CEVA101 for the treatment of severe TBI in adults is ongoing (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02525432). Cellvation received RMAT designation for CEVA101 in the treatment of severe TBI. Cellvation secured an exclusive worldwide license to CEVA101 (as well as CEVA-D and CEVA102) from University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston in October of 2016. 
DFD-29 (Modified Release Oral Minocycline for Inflammatory Lesions of Rosacea)
Through our partner company Journey in collaboration with Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd. (“DRL”), we are developing DFD-29, a modified release oral minocycline being evaluated for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea.
​
Under the DRL arrangement, Journey is responsible for the development of DFD-29, which includes conducting two Phase 3 studies to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of DFD-29 for the treatment of rosacea and the regulatory submission of a new drug application under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. DRL provides development support including the monitoring of two Phase 3 clinical trials. Journey initiated the Phase 3 trials in the first quarter of 2022, and completed enrollment in January 2023. Top-line data is expected in the first half of 2023, with a potential NDA filing anticipated in the second half of 2023.

Early Stage Product Candidates
Dotinurad
Through our partner company Urica, in May 2021, we acquired an exclusive license from Fuji Yakuhin Co. Ltd. (“Fuji”) to develop Dotinurad in North America and Europe (with the exclusive licensed territory later expanded to include the Middle East and North Africa). Dotinurad is a potential best-in-class urate transporter (URAT1) inhibitor for gout and possibly other hyperuricemic indications. Dotinurad (URECE® tablet) was approved in Japan in 2020 as a once-daily oral therapy for gout and hyperuricemia. Dotinurad was efficacious and well-tolerated in more than 500 Japanese patients treated for up to 58 weeks in Phase 3 clinical trials.
In December 2022, Urica announced the expansion of our license to include additional territories in the Middle East and North Africa (“MENA”) and Turkey territories.
Urica initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial in June 2022 to evaluate Dotinurad for the treatment of gout; we anticipate topline data in the first half of 2023.
MB-106 (CD20 CAR T for B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (“B-NHL”) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia(“CLL”))
CD20 is a B-cell lineage-specific phosphoprotein that is expressed in high, homogeneous density on the surface of more than 95% of B-cell NHL. CD20 is stable on the cell surface with minimal shedding or internalization upon binding antibody and is present at only nanomolar levels as soluble antigen. It is well established as an effective immunotherapy target, with extensive studies demonstrating improved tumor responses and survival of B-NHL patients treated with rituximab and other anti-CD20 antibodies. MB-106 is a CD20-targeted third-generation autologous CAR T cell therapy is being developed by our partner company Mustang in a collaboration with Fred Hutch.
More than 80,000 new cases of NHL are diagnosed each year in the United States, and over 20,000 patients die of this group of diseases annually. Most forms of NHL including follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, and small lymphocytic lymphoma, which account collectively for ~45% of all cases of NHL, are incurable with available therapies, except for allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (“allo-SCT”). However, many NHL patients are not suitable candidates for allo-SCT, and this treatment is also limited by significant rates of morbidity and mortality due to graft- versus-host disease. 
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (“CLL/SLL”) is a mature B cell neoplasm characterized by a progressive accumulation of monoclonal B lymphocytes. CLL is considered to be identical (i.e., one disease with different manifestations) to NHL SLL. CLL is the most common leukemia in adults in Western countries, accounting for approximately 25 to 35 percent of all leukemias in the United States. It is estimated that over 18,000 new cases of CLL/SLL will be diagnosed in the United States in 2023. 
Most patients will have a complete or partial response to initial therapy. However, conventional therapy for CLL is not curative and most patients experience relapse. In addition, many patients will require a change in therapy due to intolerance. Since patients with CLL are generally elderly with a median age older than 70 years, and due to the relatively benign course of the disease in the majority of patients, only selected patients are candidates for intensive treatments such as allo-SCT. Innovative new treatments with a favorable safety profile are therefore urgently needed for patients with relapsed and refractory disease.
Under their IND, Fred Hutch is currently conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical study to evaluate the anti-tumor activity and safety of administering CD20-directed third-generation CAR T cells incorporating both 4-1BB and CD28 co-stimulatory signaling domains (MB-106) to patients with relapsed or refractory B-NHL or CLL (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03277729). Secondary endpoints of this study include safety and toxicity, preliminary antitumor activity as measured by overall response rate and complete remission rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival. The study is also assessing CAR T cell persistence and the potential immunogenicity of the cells. Fred Hutch intends to enroll approximately 50 subjects on the study, which is being led by Principal Investigator Mazyar Shadman, M.D., M.P.H., Assistant Member of Fred Hutch’s Clinical Research Division.

The Fred Hutch IND was amended in 2019 to incorporate an optimized manufacturing process that had been developed in collaboration with Mustang.
In October 2022, Mustang treated the first patient in the Company-sponsored Phase 1/2 clinical study of MB-106 in patients with relapsed or refractory B cell NHL or CLL (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT05360238). As of December 2022, Mustang dosed five patients at the starting dose level of their respective protocol arms. The study is also being supported by a grant of approximately $2 million from the National Cancer Institute (“NCI”).
MB-101 (IL13Rα2 CAR T Cell Program for Glioblastoma)
Mustang is also currently developing MB-101 for malignant brain tumors, including glioblastoma (“GBM”). MB-101 is an optimized CAR T product targeting IL13Rα2 on the surface of the malignant cells and incorporates enhancements in CAR T design and T cell engineering to improve antitumor potency and T cell persistence. 
GBM is the most common brain and central nervous system (“CNS”) cancer, accounting for 49% of malignant primary brain and CNS tumors, 54% of all gliomas, and 16% of all primary brain and CNS tumors. More than 13,000 new glioblastoma cases were predicted in the U.S. for 2022. Malignant brain tumors are the most common cause of cancer-related deaths in adolescents and young adults aged 15-39 and the most common cancer occurring among 15-19 year-olds in the U.S. While GBM is a rare disease, it is quite lethal, with five-year survival rates historically under 10%. Standard of care therapy consists of maximal surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy with temozolomide, which, while rarely curative, is shown to extend median overall survival from 4.5 to 15 months. GBM remains difficult to treat due to the inherent resistance of the tumor to conventional therapies.
Immunotherapy approaches targeting brain tumors offer promise over conventional treatments. IL13Rα2 is an attractive target for CAR T therapy, as it has limited expression in normal tissue but is over-expressed on the surface of greater than 50% of GBM tumors. CAR T cells are designed to express membrane-tethered IL-13 receptor ligand mutated at a single site (glutamic acid at position 13 to a tyrosine; E13Y) with high affinity for IL13Rα2 and reduced binding to IL13Rα1 in order to reduce healthy tissue targeting (Kahlon KS et al. Cancer Research. 2004;64:9160-9166).
Having optimized MB-101 dose, schedule, route of administration and T cell selection in a completed Phase 1 trial, ongoing COH sponsored studies include:

1. | MB-101 with or without nivolumab and ipilimumab in treating patients with recurrent or refractory glioblastoma (currently enrolling patients; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04003649);
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | MB-101 in treating patients with recurrent or refractory glioblastoma with a substantial component of leptomeningeal disease (currently enrolling patients; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04661384);
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The final planned MB-101 trial will be in combination with the HSV-1 oncolytic virus (MB-108) in treating patients with recurrent or refractory glioblastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma. The objective of this trial is to turn immunologically “cold” tumors “hot” with MB-108 in order to potentially enhance the efficacy the efficacy of MB-101, then infuse MB-101 loco-regionally as was done in the Phase 1 single-agent MB-101 trial. The combination of MB-101 and MB-108 is referred to as MB-109.

MB-108 (HSV-1 Oncolytic Virus C134)
MB-108 is a next-generation oncolytic herpes simplex virus (“oHSV”) in development at Mustang that is conditionally replication competent; that is, it can replicate in tumor cells, but not in normal cells, thus killing the tumor cells directly through this process. It was in-licensed from Nationwide Children’s Hospital, and the University of Alabama at Birmingham (“UAB”) is evaluating the safety of this oncolytic virus in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme in an ongoing Phase 1 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03657576). 
The rationale for in-licensing MB-108 was to potentially enhance the efficacy of MB-101 by first turning immunologically “cold” malignant glioma tumors “hot” with MB-108, then infusing MB-101 loco-regionally, as was done in the phase 1 single-agent MB-101 trial. This combination is to be referred to as MB-109.

MB-102 (CD123 CAR T Cell Program for BPDCN, AML and high-risk MDS) 
Our partner company Mustang collaborates with COH and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center (“Fred Hutch”) in the development of proprietary, autologous, chimeric antigen receptor (“CAR”) engineered T-cell (“CAR T”) therapies. CAR T therapies use the patient’s own T-cells to engage and destroy specific tumors. The process involves selecting specific T-cell subtypes, genetically engineering them to express chimeric antigen receptors and placing them back in the patient where they recognize and destroy cancer cells. We believe that harnessing the body’s own immune system to treat cancer is a promising approach to cancer care that may prove curative across tumor types that have proved resistant to standard pharmacological and biological treatments.
MB-102 is a CAR T directed against CD123, a subunit of the heterodimeric interleukin-3-receptor (“IL-3R”), which is widely expressed on human hematologic malignancies including blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (“BPDCN”) and acute myeloid leukemia (“AML”). In addition, CD123 can be found on the surface of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (“B-ALL”), hairy cell leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome (“MDS”), chronic myeloid leukemia (“CML”) and Hodgkin lymphoma.
Of these malignancies, Mustang is currently investigating CD123 as a target for adoptive cellular immunotherapy in BPDCN, since high CD123 expression is associated with enhanced cell proliferation, increased resistance of these cells to apoptosis, and poor clinical prognosis. Depending on the early results in this patient population, Mustang may broaden the inclusion criteria to include AML and high-risk MDS (“hrMDS”). CD123 is overexpressed in the vast majority of cases of AML and hrMDS and in essentially all cases of BPDCN. 
In October 2020, Mustang announced the dosing of the first patient in a multicenter Phase 1/2 clinical trial of MB-102 in patients with relapsed or refractory BPDCN (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT04109482). 
​
MB-104 (CS1 CAR T for Multiple Myeloma and Light Chain Amyloidosis)
Another Mustang program is a CAR T directed against CS1 (also known as CD319, CRACC and SLAMF7), which was identified as a natural killer (“NK”) cell receptor regulating immune functions. It is also expressed on B cells, T cells, dendritic cells, NK-T cells, and monocytes. CS1 is overexpressed in multiple myeloma (“MM”) and AL amyloidosis, which makes it a good target for immunotherapy. A humanized anti-CS1 antibody, elotuzumab (Empliciti®), is approved in combination with other medications for the treatment of adult patients with MM who have received prior therapies. Despite great advances in treatment, MM remains an incurable malignancy of plasma cells. AL is a protein deposition disorder that is a result of a plasma cell dysplasia, similar to MM. Immunotherapy is an attractive approach for AL because of the low burden of disease. Our academic partners at COH have developed a novel second generation CS1-specific CAR T cell therapy. In preclinical studies, they have demonstrated efficacy of these CAR T cells, both in vitro and in vivo, within the context of clinically relevant models of MM and AL. COH is evaluating the safety of this CS1-specific CAR T cell therapy in a Phase 1 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03710421). Once COH has established a safe and effective dose for MB-104 in this trial, Mustang expects to file an IND for a multicenter Phase 1/2 trial for the treatment of patients with MM.

MB-103 (HER2 CAR T for GBM & Metastatic Breast Cancer to Brain)
HER2/neu (often shortened to “HER2”) is a growth-promoting protein on the outside of all breast cells. Breast cancer cells with higher than normal levels of HER2 are called HER2-positive (“HER2+”). These cancers tend to grow and spread faster than other breast cancers. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women, with over 42,000 women in the United States expected to die from advanced metastatic disease in 2020. Approximately 20% to 25% of breast cancers overexpress HER2, which is an established therapeutic target of both monoclonal antibodies (“mAbs”) and receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. With the advent of effective mAbs directed against HER2, the median overall survival of patients with metastatic HER2+ breast cancer has improved. However, management of metastatic disease in the CNS observed in up to 50% of HER2+ breast cancer patients continues to be a clinical challenge in large part due to the inability of mAbs to sufficiently cross the blood-brain barrier. Although small-molecule inhibitors of HER2 exist and have been clinically approved, their single-agent efficacy in the context of metastatic disease to the brain has been limited. While HER2-targeted therapy in combination with conventional agents has shown some promise for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer, control of brain metastases remains a significant unmet clinical need, as most patients survive less than two years following CNS involvement.
CAR-based T-cell immunotherapy is being actively investigated for the treatment of solid tumors, including HER2+ cancers. Mustang’s academic partners at COH have developed a second-generation HER2-specific CAR T-cell for the treatment of refractory/relapsed HER2+ GBM, as well as for the treatment of brain and/or leptomeningeal metastases from HER2+ cancers. COH’s preclinical data demonstrate effective targeting of breast cancer brain metastases with intraventricular delivery of HER2-directed CAR T cells. COH is evaluating the safety of this HER2-specific CAR T cell therapy in two phase 1 trials that commenced in the fourth quarter of 2018 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT03389230 and NCT03696030).
MB-105 (PSCA CAR T for Prostate & Pancreatic Cancers)
Prostate stem-cell antigen (“PSCA”) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell membrane glycoprotein. In addition to being highly expressed in the prostate it is also expressed in the bladder, placenta, colon, kidney, and stomach. Prostate cancer may be amenable to T cell-based immunotherapy since several tumor antigens, including PSCA, are widely over-expressed in metastatic disease. Mustang’s academic partners at COH have developed a second-generation PSCA-specific CAR T cell therapy that has demonstrated robust in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activity in patient-derived, clinically relevant, bone-metastatic prostate cancer xenograft models. COH is evaluating the safety of this PSCA-specific CAR T cell therapy in a Phase 1 trial treating patients with PSCA+ metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03873805).
In October 2020, Mustang announced initial data from the Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with PSCA+-positive castration-resistance prostate cancer (“CRPC”). In a presentation at the Annual Prostate Cancer Foundation Scientific Retreat, the COH principal investigator reported results from a highly refractory patient treated with MB-105 who experienced a 94 percent reduction in prostate-specific antigen (PSA), near complete reduction of measurable soft tissue metastasis by computerized tomography, and improvement in bone metastases by magnetic resonance imaging. Data presented in February 2022 indicate that PSCA-CAR T-cell therapy is feasible in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (“mCRPC”) with a dose-limiting toxicity of cystitis, and shows preliminary anti-tumor effect at a dose of 100M cells plus lymphodepletion. 
AJ201 (novel AR degrader and Nrf1 and Nrf2 activator)
In February 2023, Avenue announced the license of intellectual property rights underlying AJ201 from AnnJi Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. AJ201 is currently being studied in a Phase 1b/2a multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trial at six clinical sites across the U.S. for the treatment of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (“SBMA”), also known as Kennedy’s Disease (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05517603). 
SBMA is a rare, inherited, X-linked genetic neuromuscular disease primarily affecting men and AJ201 was designed to modify SBMA through multiple mechanisms including degradation of the abnormal AR protein and by stimulating Nrf1 and Nrf2, which are involved in protecting cells from oxidative stress which can lead to cell death.

16



AJ201 has been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA for the indications of SBMA, Huntington’s Disease, and Spinocerebellar Ataxia.
BAER-101 (novel α2/3–subtype-selective GABA A positive allosteric modulator (“PAM”))
Through Avenue’s subsidiary Baergic, we are developing BAER-101, a high affinity, selective modulator of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (“GABA”) A, which is a receptor system with differential binding and modulatory properties dependent on the particular GABA A subtype. Baergic intends to explore BAER-101 in a number of CNS disorders where patients are not adequately treated, including epilepsy and acute anxiety disorders.
Preclinical Product Candidates
Mayo Clinic In Vivo CAR T Platform Technology
In August 2021, Mustang announced an exclusive license agreement with the Mayo Clinic for a novel technology to create in vivo CAR T cells that may be able to transform the administration of CAR T therapies and has the potential to be used as an off-the-shelf therapy. Preclinical proof-of-concept has been established, and the ongoing development of this technology continues to take place at Mayo Clinic.
AAV-ATP7A Gene Therapy
Through our subsidiary Cyprium, we are developing adeno-associated virus (“AAV”) gene therapy (“AAV-ATP7A”). Cyprium entered into a license agreement with Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development to acquire the global rights to develop and commercialize AAV-ATP7A gene therapy. AAV-ATP7A gene therapy has demonstrated the ability to rescue neurological phenotypes and improve survival when coadministered with copper histidinate injections in a mouse model of Menkes disease and has been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA. 
AVTS-001 Gene Therapy
Through our subsidiary Aevitas, we are developing AVTS-001, an AAV gene therapy to treat diseases associated with a dysregulated complement system via AAV delivery of functional short Factor H. Aevitas has licensed an engineered, fully functional shortened version of Factor H which can be packaged by AAV, from the University of Pennsylvania. Aevitas also has a collaboration with University of Massachusetts Medical to optimize AAV constructs.
CK-103 (BET Inhibitor)
Checkpoint is currently developing CK-103, a novel, selective and potent small molecule inhibitor of bromodomain and extra-terminal (“BET”) bromodomains. Checkpoint plans to develop CK-103 for the treatment of various advanced and metastatic solid tumor cancers, including, but not limited to, those associated with elevated c-Myc expression. Checkpoint entered into an exclusive license agreement with Jubilant Biosys Limited to develop and commercialize novel compounds that inhibit BET bromodomains on a worldwide basis. Checkpoint entered into a Sublicense Agreement with TGTX to develop and commercialize CK-103 in the field of hematological malignancies. Checkpoint retains the right to develop and commercialize CK-103 in solid tumors. Currently, Checkpoint has completed the required CMC, pharmacology and toxicology activities that it believes will support an IND application filing.

17



CEVA-D and CEVA-102 
Through our subsidiary Cellvation, we are developing CEVA-D, a novel bioreactor device that enhances the anti-inflammatory potency of bone marrow-derived cells without genetic manipulation, using wall shear stress to suppress tumor necrosis factor-a (“TNF-a”) production by activated immune cells. CEVA-102 is the first cell product produced by CEVA-D, and may be applicable for various indications, including the treatment of severe TBI.
CK-302 (Anti-GITR)
CK-302 is a fully human agonistic monoclonal antibody in development at Checkpoint that is designed to bind and trigger signaling in GITR expressing cells. Scientific literature indicates GITR is a co-stimulatory molecule of the TNF receptor family and is expressed on activated T cells, B cells, NK and regulatory T cells. Checkpoint believes that an anti-GITR monoclonal antibody has the potential to be effective in one or more oncological indications as a monotherapy or in combination with an anti-PD-L1 antibody as well as other anti-tumor immune response potentiating compounds and targeted therapies.
CK-303 (Anti-CAIX)
Also in development at Checkpoint is CK-303, a fully human anti-carbonic anhydrase IX (“CAIX”) antibody designed to recognize CAIX expressing cells and kill them via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (“CDC”). Scientific literature indicates that CAIX is a well characterized tumor associated antigen with expression almost exclusively limited to the cells of renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”). More than 85% of RCC cases have been demonstrated to express high levels of CAIX expression. There is very limited expression of this antigen on healthy tissue which Checkpoint believes will limit reactivity of this antibody against healthy tissues.
ONCOlogues (Oligonucleotide Platform)
Our subsidiary Oncogenuity is developing a delivery platform that allows peptic nucleic acids to enter cell membrane and nucleus, displace the targeted mutant DNA strand, and prevent mutant mRNA transcription. Oncogenuity is seeking to optimize lead candidates targeting genetically driven cancers, including KRAS G12D, and other genetic disorders.
Intellectual Property Generally
Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our product candidates, formulations, processes, methods and any other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our product candidates, proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents, both in the United States and abroad. However, patent protection may not afford us with complete protection against competitors who seek to circumvent our patents.
We also depend upon the skills, knowledge, experience and know-how of our management and research and development personnel, as well as that of our advisers, consultants and other contractors. To help protect our proprietary know-how, which is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce, we currently rely and will in the future rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we require all of our employees, consultants, advisers and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business.

Competition
We operate in highly competitive segments of the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical markets. We face competition from many different sources, including commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies, and private and public research institutions. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, product development, manufacturing and marketing resources than us. Large pharmaceutical companies have extensive experience in clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approval for drugs. In addition, many universities and private and public research institutes are active in research in direct competition with us. We also may compete with these organizations to recruit scientists and clinical development personnel. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
Our competitors are pursuing the development and/or acquisition of pharmaceuticals, medical devices and over-the-counter (“OTC”) products that target the same diseases and conditions that we are targeting in biotechnology, biopharmaceutical, dermatological and other therapeutic areas. If competitors introduce new products, delivery systems or processes with therapeutic or cost advantages, our products can be subject to progressive price reductions or decreased volume of sales, or both. Most new products that we introduce must compete with other products already on the market or products that are later developed by competitors. The principal methods of competition for our products include quality, efficacy, market acceptance, price, and marketing and promotional efforts, patient access programs and product insurance coverage reimbursement.
The only pharmaceutical area in which we sell marketed products is dermatology, and the dermatology competitive landscape is highly fragmented, with a large number of mid-size and smaller companies competing in both the prescription sector and the OTC sector. Our competitors are pursuing the development and/or acquisition of pharmaceuticals, medical devices and OTC products that target the same diseases and conditions that we are targeting in dermatology. Competitive factors vary by product line and geographic area in which our products are sold. The principal methods of competition for our products include quality, efficacy, market acceptance, price, and marketing and promotional efforts.
Branded products often must compete with therapeutically similar branded or generic products or with generic equivalents. Such competition frequently increases over time. For example, if competitors introduce new products, delivery systems or processes with therapeutic or cost advantages, our products could be subject to progressive price reductions and/or decreased volume of sales. To successfully compete for business, we must often demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits, but also cost advantages as compared with other forms of care. Accordingly, we face pressure to continually seek out technological innovations and to market our products effectively.
Our major competitors, including Galderma Laboratories, Almirall, Novan Health, Ortho-Dermatologics, Mayne Pharmaceuticals, Sun Pharma, Leo Pharma, and Arcutis Biotherapeutics, among others, vary depending on therapeutic and product category, dosage strength and drug-delivery systems, among other factors.
Generic Competition
Our partner company Journey faces increased competition from manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products, who may submit applications to FDA seeking to market generic versions of Journey’s products. In connection with these applications, the generic drug companies may seek to challenge the validity and enforceability of our patents through litigation. When patents covering certain of our products (if applicable) expire or are successfully challenged through litigation or in USPTO proceedings, if a generic company launches a competing product “at risk,” or when the regulatory or licensed exclusivity for our products (if applicable) expires or is otherwise lost, we may face generic competition as a result. Generic versions are generally significantly less expensive than branded versions, and, where available, may be required to be utilized before or in preference to the branded version under third-party reimbursement programs, or substituted by pharmacies. Accordingly, when a branded product loses its market exclusivity, it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product. To successfully compete for business with managed care and pharmacy benefits management organizations, we must often demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits, but also cost advantages as compared with other forms of care. Generic products generally face intense competition from other generic equivalents (including authorized generics) and therapeutically similar branded or generic products.
19



Government Regulation and Product Approval
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing.
United States Pharmaceutical Product Development Process
In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical (drug and biological) products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and implementing regulations. Pharmaceutical products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product-development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA compliance and enforcement actions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial compliance or enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the United States generally includes the following:

● | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to good laboratory practices (“GLPs”) or other applicable regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must be in effect before human clinical trials may begin in the United States;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s current good clinical practices (“GCPs”), to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed pharmaceutical product for its intended use;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of a NDA or BLA for a new pharmaceutical product;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the pharmaceutical product is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMPs”), to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the pharmaceutical product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | potential FDA audit of the preclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA.
--+-------------------------------------------

The regulatory review and approval process is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. The process of seeking required approvals before we can market or sell a product, and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain the appropriate marketing authorization for any product.
Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the pharmaceutical product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the pharmaceutical product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA places the IND on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a pharmaceutical product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that submission of an IND will automatically result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that causes such clinical trial to be suspended or terminated.

20



Clinical trials involve the administration of the pharmaceutical product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by the sponsor. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA if conducted under a U.S. IND. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) or ethics committee if conducted outside of the United States, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB or ethics committee is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB or ethics committee also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. We intend to use third-party clinical research organizations (“CROs”) to administer and conduct our planned clinical trials and will rely upon such CROs, as well as medical institutions, clinical investigators and consultants, to conduct our trials in accordance with our clinical protocols and to play a significant role in the subsequent collection and analysis of data from these trials. The failure by any of such third parties to meet expected timelines, adhere to our protocols or meet regulatory standards could adversely impact the subject product development program. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

● | Phase 1. The pharmaceutical product is usually introduced into a small group of healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer treatments, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2. The pharmaceutical product is evaluated in a larger, but still limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish safety and efficacy, the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Generally, it has been the FDA’s position that Congress intended at least two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials for approval of an NDA or BLA or foreign authorities for approval of marketing applications.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Post-approval studies, or Phase 4 clinical trials, may be required after initial receipt of marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and may be required by the FDA after it has been approved, and is on the market, as an ongoing condition of approval.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or, if used, its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB or ethics committee can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s or ethics committee’s requirements or if the pharmaceutical product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the pharmaceutical product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the pharmaceutical product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final pharmaceutical product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected, tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the pharmaceutical product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

21



United States Review and Approval Process
The data and results generated from product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the pharmaceutical product, proposed labeling and other required information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA submission before the product can be marketed and sold.
The review and approval process for an NDA or BLA is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may not approve an NDA or BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or if the data and results in the submission are insufficient to support a finding of safety and efficacy, FDA may also require additional clinical data or other data and information to address deficiencies in an application. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Even if a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited with respect to dosages, indications for use, or other label claims related to those disease states, conditions and patient populations for which the product is safe and effective and, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMPs, which impose additional regulatory requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. We cannot be certain that we or our suppliers will be able to fully comply with the cGMPs or other FDA regulatory requirements.
Post-Approval Requirements
Any pharmaceutical products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing postmarket regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, promoting pharmaceutical products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the pharmaceutical product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, compliance and enforcement actions initiated by the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties. The FDA also may require Phase 4 testing, risk minimization action plans and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product.
Orphan Drugs
Under the Orphan Drug Act, special incentives exist for sponsors to develop products for rare diseases or conditions, which are defined to include those diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. Requests for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the submission of an NDA or BLA.
If a product that has an orphan drug designation is the first such product to receive FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity for that use. This means that, subsequent to approval, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug that designated orphan use, except in limited circumstances, for seven years. The FDA may approve a subsequent application from another person if the FDA determines that the application is for a different drug or different use, or if the FDA determines that the subsequent product is clinically superior, or that the holder of the initial orphan drug approval cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the public’s need. If the FDA approves someone else’s application for the same drug that has orphan exclusivity, but for a different use, the competing drug could be prescribed by physicians outside its FDA approval for the orphan use, notwithstanding the existence of orphan exclusivity. A grant of an orphan designation is not a guarantee that a product will be approved. If a sponsor receives orphan drug exclusivity upon approval, there can be no assurance that the exclusivity will prevent another person from receiving approval for the same or a similar drug for the same or other uses.

22



Pediatric Information
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), NDAs and BLAs or supplements to NDAs and BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the treatment for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the treatment is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act provides BLA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity-patent or non-patent-for a product if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within a specific time frame.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (formerly the Health Care Financing Administration), other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the United States Department of Justice and individual United States Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors, including government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Third-party payors are increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy, and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available for our products to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in research and product development. We are unable to predict the future course of federal or state healthcare legislation and regulations, including the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”). The ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and additional downward pressure on the payments received for any approved drug. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government healthcare programs result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. We are unable to predict what these changes may look like following the 2020 election and subsequent change of Administration.
​
International Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, there are a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials, pricing and reimbursement, and commercial sales and distribution of any product candidates. Importantly, the level of evidence of efficacy and safety necessary to apply for marketing authorization for a drug candidate differs from country to country, the approval process also varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. Typically, if a foreign regulatory authority is satisfied that a company has presented adequate evidence of safety, quality and efficacy, then the regulatory authority will grant a marketing authorization. This foreign regulatory approval process, however, involves risks similar or identical to the risks associated with FDA approval discussed above, and therefore there are no guarantees that any company will be able to obtain the appropriate marketing authorization for any product in any particular country.
