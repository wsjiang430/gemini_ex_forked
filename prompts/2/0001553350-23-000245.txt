ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Company Overview
  
Energy and Water Development Corp. (the “Company” or “EAWD”) was originally incorporated as a Delaware corporation named Wealthhound.com, Inc. in 2000 and was converted to a Florida corporation under the name Eagle International Holdings Group Inc. on December 14, 2007.
 
On March 10, 2008, the Company changed its name to Eurosport Active World Corporation and on March 17, 2008, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Acquisition (the “Acquisition Agreement”) with Inko Sport America, LLC (“ISA”), a privately-held Florida limited liability company wherein all of the certified owners of ISA exchanged their ownership interests in ISA for shares of the Company. In connection with the closing of the Acquisition Agreement, the Company adopted ISA’s business plan and the Company’s registered current directors were elected to their positions. This transaction was accounted for as a recapitalization effected by a share exchange, wherein ISA was considered the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes. ISA was administratively dissolved in September 2010.
 
In September 2019, the Company changed its name to Energy and Water Development Corp. to more accurately reflect the Company’s purpose and business sector and the Company has registered its logo “EAWD” with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the European Union Intellectual Property Office and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) to secure its corporate identity.
 
To ensure the Company is positioned to service its growing business in one of the EU’s most environmentally progressive countries, the Company has a branch registered to conduct business in Germany and two wholly-owned German subsidiaries: Energy and Water Development Deutschland GmbH (“EAWD Deutschland”) and EAWD Logistik GmbH (“EAWD Logistik”).

The green tech industry is constantly evolving due to ongoing and increasing water scarcity as well as increased energy needs in the world. Therefore, we believe that by designing sustainable and renewable solutions to these problems, EAWD will become an essential component of a rapidly growing industry with many new markets.
 
The green tech industry is complex because it still requires increased promotion and public education about its potential. Furthermore, regulations in each country are different and, in many cases, several segments are regulated by both national and local (state, provincial, municipal) governments. EAWD’s approach seeks to assist businesses with the growth and development of their general operations by ensuring the efficient, profitable, and sustainable supply/generation of water and energy allowing our potential customers to focus on their business while adopting strategies of sustainability. Using our own EAWD Off-Grid AWG Systems, EAWD Off-Grid EV Charging Stations, EAWD Off-Grid Power Systems, EAWD Off-Grid Water Purification Systems, and other identified technology, products, and services licensed or purchased from third party sources, we are delivering and installing a product set that suits the green technology water and/or energy needs of our customers. By using the state-of-the art technological solutions and technologies identified, designed, and provided by EAWD and its collaborators, we believe that our potential clients will be free to focus on the performance of their operations as well as with the water and energy consumption or generation regulations within their industry. Our clients may be businesses seeking to upgrade their business processes, NGOs or governmental entities seeking to apply green technology solutions for the water and energy they supply to their constituencies.
 
We continue to be a development stage company. The Company presently assembles its EAWD Off-Grid AWG Systems and EAWD Off-Grid EV Charging Stations at its workshop in Germany and outsources most of its engineering and technical services as well as services relating to the promotion, selling, and distribution of its products. We presently have only nine employees: Ms. Velazquez, our Chief Executive Officer, Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors, and a significant stockholder, Mr. Hofmeier, our Chief Technology Officer, Chairman of the Board of Directors, and a significant stockholder, two engineers, two technicians, one accountant assistant, and two assemblers. Ms. Velazquez and Mr. Hofmeier are married.
 
We seek to focus on three main aspects of the water and energy business: (1) generation, (2) supply, and (3) maintenance. We seek to assist private companies, government entities and municipalities, and NGOs to build profitable and sustainable supplies/generation capabilities of water and energy as required by selling them the required technology or technical service to enhance their productivity/operability. With its outsourced technical arm and its commission-based global network of distributors, the Company expects to create sustainable added value to each project it takes on while generating revenue from the sale of own EAWD Off-Grid AWG Systems, EAWD Off-Grid EV Charging Stations, EAWD Off-Grid Power Systems, and EAWD Off-Grid Water Purification Systems, royalties from the commercialization of energy and water in certain cases, and the licensing of our innovated technologies; as well as from its engineering, technical consulting, and project management services.

Our Vision
 
The size of the global market for atmospheric water generators was estimated at USD 959.85 million in 2020, reached USD 1,074.01 million in 2021, and at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.75%, is expected to reach USD 2,515.19 million by 2027. (Source: Atmospheric Water Generator Market 2022 Report published by 360i Research)
 
The main market dynamics to consider are the growing numbers of AWGs across various end-use verticals and versus the high energy consumption, production cost, and high carbon footprint of such technology. Our research and development activities in AWG technology have led us to develop novel technologies that overcome these negative dynamics (such as our EAWD Off-Grid AWG Systems).
 
The mission of EAWD is to provide sustainable water generation systems based on high efficiency, renewable sources and to provide off-grid self-sufficient energy supply solutions. Through a combination of the best design and configuration of state-of-the-art technology-assisted solutions, EAWD has created a completely self-sufficient off the grid energy generation and water production system, which can be simultaneously used to meet potable water requirements and the electrical energy needs of the industrial sector.
 
EAWD promotes and commercializes its green technology solutions via commission-based distributers and agents worldwide.
 
Through our BlueTech Alliance for Water Generation, established in December 2020, we have state-of-the-art technology partners, technology transfer agreements, and technology representation agreements in place relating to aspects of renewable energy and water supply. These unique key relationships offer important selling features and capabilities that differentiated EAWD from its competitors.

Our Products
 
The technological solutions offered by our Company are the following:
 
EAWD Off-Grid AWG Systems
 
Today, atmospheric water generators (AWGs) are standard equipment in many places; however, operating AWGs requires high amounts of energy that is often not available in the places where they are needed most, making the price for the generated water very high. Our innovative EAWD Off-Grid AWG Systems are designed to have an internal power supply and ability to generate power. Our EAWD Off-Grid AWG Systems produce sufficient quantities of potable water even in very dry and hot climate conditions and can be scaled to almost any size, community, and/or population. Presently, AWGs are largely used in Asian and African countries. The majority of manufacturers of AWGs, which rely on dehumidifying, are located in China. Almost every U.S. based AWG brand is also supplied by manufacturers in China.
 
By contrast, EAWD uses a proven German technology for condensate water from the air based on A/C technology. We believe that this method allows higher, more efficient, sustainable performance and a larger quantity of water generation because of its internal power supply and because it does not require high humidity to function. EAWD has licensed the rights to use this German AWG technology for ninety-nine years; however, thanks to our continued research and development efforts, the Company has designed a new, innovative and more efficient configuration that allows the substantial amount of energy required to operate the equipment to be supplied by the equipment itself. Our EAWD Off-Grid AWG Systems line is different in size from the standard AWG line. Our EAWD Off-Grid AWG Systems are energy self-sufficient and can condense large amounts of water out of the atmosphere and we believe they could be a solution in countries around the world that deal with issues of water scarcity.
 
Our EAWD Off-Grid AWG System with an internal power supply, works by first “inhaling” large volumes of air, then cooling the air down to the dew point, and finally collecting, filtering, and mineralizing the resulting condensed water. Through this process, pure drinking water is created that meets the quality standards of the World Health Organization (WHO). In regions with high temperatures and high humidity levels, a single system can generate more than 300,000 liters of water per day. Our EAWD Off-Grid AWG Systems line starts at 2,640 gallons/day and can expand the water supply to one acre-feet/day, which we believe, in effect, is essentially the ability to produce an unlimited supply of water. As a certified vendor of the United Nations (UN) Global Marketplace, EAWD is introducing the EAWD Off-Grid AWG and Power Systems to the UN with the hopes of initially supplying the equipment to large cluster of agencies established in key locations for humanitarian response as well as refugee camps around the world in need of fresh water.
 
EAWD Off-Grid Water Purification Systems
 EAWD also seeks to respond to the growing need for drinking water by proposing a water purification solution utilizing solar, photovoltaic energy and, when applicable, a mini-windmill or other alternate source of renewable energy. The design of the system is ready to be built and delivered on demand.
 Generally, drinking water is produced by passing sea water, lake water, river water, or stagnant water through several stages of purification and treatment until it is rendered drinkable in accordance with WHO standards. In the case of sea or stagnant water, we recommend a treatment via reverse osmosis membranes, which permits the retention of dissolved solids and results in obtaining water of drinking quality. If the water being treated emanates from lakes or rivers, we recommend treatment via an ultrafiltration membrane which functions by retaining suspended materials such as colloids, viruses and bacteria. The systems proposed by EAWD are containerized and contain all the equipment necessary to function autonomously, in part due to an automatic cleansing system that can be accessed remotely via satellite or the internet. Moreover, the machines use available renewable energy sources such as solar or wind to function.

EAWD Off-Grid EV Charging Stations
 
The global electric vehicle market was valued at $162.34 billion in 2019, and is projected to reach $802.81 billion by 2027, registering a CAGR of 22.6%. Asia-Pacific was the highest revenue contributor, accounting for $84.84 billion in 2019, and is estimated to reach $357.81 billion by 2027, with a CAGR of 20.1%. North America is estimated to reach $194.20 billion by 2027, at a significant CAGR of 27.5%. Asia- Pacific and Europe collectively accounted for around 74.8% share in 2019, with the former constituting around 52.3% share. North America and Europe are expected to witness considerable CAGRs of 27.5% and 25.3%, respectively, during the forecast period. The cumulative share of these two segments was 40.1% in 2019, and is anticipated to reach 51.0% by 2027. (Source: Electric Vehicle Fluids Market Global Forecast to 2030 2021 Report from Markets and Markets.)
 
There is also an increasing consensus among European truck manufacturers and industry stakeholders that battery electric trucks (BETs) will play a dominant role in the decarbonization of the road freight sector. Most truck makers including Daimler, DAF, MAN, Scania and Volvo are now focusing on bringing BETs to the mass market for all vehicle segments, including long-haul, starting from 2024. For this, a network of public high-power and overnight charging points needs to be rolled out across Europe no later than 2024.
 
Based on our patent-pending Off-Grid Power System, EAWD has developed an innovative design and configuration of off-grid charging stations for BETs and electric vehicles in Germany. Our product is the first off-grid solution available in Europe for charging the BETs and electric passenger vehicles that are currently on the roads of Europe. EAWD plans to establish up to 1,700 charging stations throughout the USA, Mexico and Germany starting with 40 locations scheduled to be deployed in the fourth quarter of 2024.
 
EAWD Off-Grid Power Systems
 
Today, batteries for stationary storage have become a commodity, but in order to reduce the duration, complexity and cost of the installation, and to increase its capacity or relocate a system over time as well as to reduce its carbon footprint and environmental impact, we offer a complete Electrical Energy Storage System (EESS) and Energy Management System (EMS) for a wide range of customers and applications, including microgrids and EV fast charging stations. A highly capable energy management system which secures the efficient energy supply and storage of energy. Example: with elements such as software and Battery Management System (BMS) our systems can allow controlled and optimized battery cell management.
 
This product portfolio includes systems and complete services for solar power generation in the building envelope. A high-quality frameless glass solar panel with a super-matte surface, which secures a high-performance energy source.
 
In contrast to classic solar systems on the roof, EAWD combines the highest standards of aesthetics with high efficiency energy generation. With these solutions, EAWD supports its customers on their way to CO2 neutrality and the search for alternative renewable energies.
 
Current Projects
 
COVID-19 is an incomparable global public health emergency that has affected almost every industry and has caused the worst global economic contraction of the past 80 years (IMF) and the current war in Ukraine has also caused significant changes in consumer behavior and purchasing patterns, supply chain routing, the dynamics of current market forces, and government oversight and intervention. As a consequence of the foregoing, the following projects have been delayed; however the Company continues to make progress on their fulfillment:
Germany
 
The Company has leased 24,000 sq. mi of land in Kassel, Germany, where it is establishing the first large off-grid charging station location for electric trucks and passenger vehicles in Germany and Europe. With enough solar panels installed, each charging station is proposed to generate at least five MWh of solar energy per day and have a total capacity of at least one MWp. More than 2,400 MWh of energy storage capacity will be used in lithium battery systems (LFP), to ensure the continuous use and availability of energy. The system is low voltage AC coupled, which will ensure easy integration and expansion of the system in the future. The different elements of EAWD’s system form a “micro grid” that is isolated and independent from the public power grid. It will have a capacity up to one MW of instant and continuous power. The charging points will be of 300 KW of power, with the capacity to charge two trucks simultaneously of 150 KW each, of course it will also be able to charge any other electric vehicle since it has the most common and standard connections/adapters in Europe.

JOBS Act and the Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
 
We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We elected to take advantage of all of these exemptions.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards, and delay compliance with new or revised accounting standards until those standards are applicable to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We will be an emerging growth company until the last day of the first fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our first common equity offering, although we will lose that status earlier if our annual revenues exceed $1.0 billion, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt in any three-year period or if we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). We will qualify as a “large accelerated filer” as of the first day of the first fiscal year after we have (i) more than $700,000,000 in outstanding common equity held by our non-affiliates as of the last day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter; (ii) been a public company for at least 12 months; and (iii) filed at least one annual report with the SEC. The value of our outstanding common equity will be measured each year on the last day of our second fiscal quarter.
 
COVID-19 Pandemic Update and the War in Ukraine
 
The outbreak of Coronavirus (COVID-19) has caused significant disruptions to national and global economies and government activities. However, during this time, we have continued to conduct our operations to the fullest extent possible, while responding to the outbreak with actions that include:
 

● | coordinating closely with our suppliers and customers; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | instituting various aspects of our business continuity programs; and 
● | planning for and working aggressively to mitigate disruptions that may occur.

 
COVID-19 is an incomparable global public health emergency that has affected almost every industry and has caused the worst global economic contraction of the past 80 years (IMF) and the current war in Ukraine has also caused significant changes in consumer behavior and purchasing patterns, supply chain routing, the dynamics of current market forces, and government oversight and intervention.. Disruptive activities could include the temporary closure of our manufacturing facilities and those used in our supply chain processes, restrictions on the export or shipment of our products, significant cutback of ocean container delivery from Germany, business closures in impacted areas, and restrictions on our employees’ and consultants’ ability to travel and to meet with customers. The extent to which COVID-19 or the war in Ukraine impacts our results will depend on future developments, which still uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the current conflict as well as virus variants and the actions to contain it or treat its impact, among others. COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine could also continue to result in social, economic and labor instability in the countries in which we or our customers and suppliers operate.
 
If workers at one or more of our offices or the offices of our suppliers or manufacturers become ill or are quarantined and in either or both events are therefore unable to work, our operations could be subject to disruption. Further, if our manufacturers become unable to obtain necessary raw materials or components, we may incur higher supply costs or our manufacturers may be required to reduce production levels, either of which may negatively affect our financial condition or results of operations.
 
In light of these challenges, the Company is focusing its efforts on supporting key areas of our business that will help us to stabilize in the new environment and strategize for what comes next. Those key areas are: crisis management and response, workforce, operation and supply chain, finance and liquidity, tax, trade and regulatory, as well as strategy and brand.
