Item 1. Business
 
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Form 10-K”), references to the “Company” and to “we,” “us,” “our” and refer to FutureTech II Acquisition Corp.
 
Overview
 
We are a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on August 19, 2021. The Company was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the “Business Combination”). We are an emerging growth company and, as such, we are subject to all of the risks associated with emerging growth companies.
 
Our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic location, although we currently intend to focus on opportunities to acquire U.S. companies in the disruptive technology sector, for example, artificial intelligence, or AI, robotic process automation, or Robotics, and any other related technology innovations market. We shall not undertake our initial business combination with any entity with its principal business operations in China (including Hong Kong and Macau). While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business industry or sector, we intend to capitalize on our management team’s differentiated ability to source, acquire and manage a business in the technology industry.

Our management team is led by Yuquan Wang, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. Yuquan Wang is a New York based investor in hardware-based technologies. Mr. Wang is the Founding Partner of Haiyin Capital, a venture capital fund formed in 2008 that focuses on investing in new technologies around the world. To date, Haiyin Capital has invested in hardware-based technology companies around the world, with AI and Robotics as key fields of investment. Haiyin Capital’s portfolio companies include Hanson Robotics, an AI and Robotics company dedicated to creating socially intelligent, human-like machines that enrich the quality of human lives; Soft Robotics, a company that designs and builds automated hand-like devices using proprietary soft robotic grippers and AI to solve problems related to grasping items in industries such as food processing, consumer goods production, and logistics. Prior to being an investor, Mr. Wang had 20 years of experience in the field of consulting and was the founder, first Chairman and Chief Advisor of Frost & Sullivan (China branch). Additionally, Mr. Wang is a frequent speaker on topics such as trends in technology and is featured on the Dedao Platform (a provider of online education courses in China) and Toutiao (among the leading news apps in China over the past several years). Mr. Wang has published articles on global technology trends and since 2017 has branded an annual 4-hour technology review show “Mapping Global Innovation”; annually, the review show has attracted on-site attendees and a large online following. Mr. Wang has written four books on global innovation: Modularized Innovation, The Invisible Trends, Industry Insights Handbook and The Indispensable China, which was Mr. Wang’s latest book (the titles of these works are approximate translations). Mr. Wang believes cross-border cooperation is crucial for the future global innovation, and therefore founded Innovation Map in 2016, a company that facilitates cross-boundary business and cultural communication especially between United States and China. Mr. Wang currently serves as an advisor to the George H.W. Bush Foundation for U.S.-China Relations. Mr. Wang earned his bachelor’s degree in Biology from Beijing Normal University.
 
The Company’s sponsor is FutureTech Partners II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Sponsor”). On February 18, 2022, we consummated our Initial Public Offering of 11,500,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the Class A common stock included in the Units being offered, the “Public Shares”), at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $115,000,000 (the “Initial Public Offering”), including full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional Units.
 
Simultaneously with the consummation of the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the private placement of an aggregate of 520,075 units (the “Placement Units”) to the Sponsor at a price of $10.00 per Placement Unit, generating total gross proceeds of $5,200,750 (the “Private Placement”). The Placement Units were issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the transactions did not involve a public offering.
 
A total of $117,300,000, comprised of the proceeds from the Offering and the proceeds of private placements that closed on February 18, 2022, net of the underwriting commissions, discounts, and offering expenses, was deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of our public stockholders.
 
Our Business Strategy
 
We believe that the Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) and Robotics sectors are evolving quickly and will experience substantial growth in the coming years. AI and Robotics have the potential to improve social productivity, bring disruptive changes to human life, safer work, more affordable products and services, smarter and more human-friendly infrastructures, new markets and more emerging employment opportunities. AI and Robotics are becoming fully commercialized and bring profound changes to all industries. The opportunity for technology companies serving these needs has never been greater, and we believe this trend will continue to generate significant value on a global scale.
Artificial Intelligence
 
We believe that we are living in a digital era where AI is poised to reshape our lives. The continuous research and innovation directed by the tech giants are driving the adoption of advanced AI technologies in industry verticals, such as automotive, healthcare, retail, finance, and manufacturing.
 
The global artificial intelligence (AI) software market is forecast to grow rapidly in the coming years and reach approximately $126 billion by 2025. We believe the development of AI will facilitate growth in a variety of industries such as auto driving, smart city, the Internet of things (“IoT”) and Robotics. The investment in AI is also growing rapidly. According to IDC, global investment in AI is projected to grow from approximately $50.1 billion in 2020 to over approximately $110.0 billion in 2024.

Our Acquisition Criteria
 
The focus of our management team to create stockholder value by leveraging its experience to improve the efficiency of the business, while implementing strategies to grow revenue and profits organically and/or through acquisitions. Consistent with our strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. While we intend to use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating prospective businesses, we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We intend to seek to acquire one or more companies that we believe have:

● | Market trend and focus 
--+---------------------------

 
We will focus on hardware technology companies that have large market potentials, mainly in areas of AI and Robotics. Based on the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, robots are becoming the underlying operating system of our society. Integrated with AI, robots can perform complex tasks that require rich human experience. Various types of robots have been introduced into the market, such as cleaning robots, hotel service robots, logistics robots, cruising robots, cooking robots and human-like social robots. These robots are gradually being integrated into our daily lives and we believe that they will likely be significantly further popularized in the future.
 

● | Opportunity for operational improvements 
--+---------------------------------------------

 
We will seek to identify businesses that we believe are stable but at an inflection point and would benefit from our ability to drive improvements in the target’s processes, go-to market strategy, product or service offering, sales and marketing efforts, geographical presence and/or leadership team.

● | Leading industry position and competitive market advantage 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------

 
We will seek to acquire a business whose products utilize a proprietary or patented technology, have a significant market position in a specific geographic or technological niche, or have a significant market position in a specific geographic or technological niche, or have some other form of distinct competitive advantage. The factors we intend to consider include management’s credentials, growth prospects, competitive dynamics, level of industry consolidation, need for capital investment, intellectual property, barriers to entry, and merger terms. These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the SEC.
 
In addition to any potential business candidates we may identify on our own, we anticipate that other target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity funds and large business enterprises
 
Our Acquisition Process
 
In evaluating a potential target business, we expect to conduct a comprehensive due diligence review to seek to determine a company’s quality and its intrinsic value. That due diligence review may include, among other things, financial statement analysis, detailed document reviews, technology diligence, multiple meetings with management, consultations with relevant industry and academic experts, competitors, customers and suppliers, as well as a review of additional information that we will seek to obtain as part of our analysis of a target company.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from either an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. Furthermore, in the event that we seek such a business combination, we expect that the independent members of our board of directors would be involved in the process for considering and approving the transaction.
 
Members of our management team, including our officers and directors, directly or indirectly own our securities and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target company is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Each of our officers and directors, as well as our management team, may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination, including if the retention or resignation of any such officers, directors, and management team members was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to such business combination.
 
We have not selected any specific business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target.
 
Each of our directors, director nominees and officers presently have and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to identify and pursue business combination opportunities or complete our initial business combination.
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company, and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and to the extent the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without violating another legal obligation.

Our founder, sponsor, officers, and directors may sponsor, form or participate in other blank check companies similar to ours during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination and their respective participation in any such companies may present additional conflicts of interest in respect of determining to which such company a particular business combination opportunity should be presented, particularly in the event there is overlap among the investment mandates of such companies. Additionally, one of our directors, Mr. Stein, has invested in other blank check companies. We do not believe Mr. Stein’s investments would affect our ability to identify and pursue business opportunities or complete our initial business combination.
 
Moreover, because our management team has significant experience in identifying and executing multiple acquisition opportunities simultaneously and we are not limited by industry or geography in terms of the acquisition opportunities we can pursue, except with respect to our prohibition from seeking target acquisitions in China and Hong Kong. In addition, our founder, sponsor, officers, and directors are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence.
 
Initial Business Combination
 
Nasdaq rules require that we complete one or more initial business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination.
 
If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target’s assets or prospects.
 
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business for the post-acquisition company to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires an interest in the target or assets sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
 
Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for the purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable.

The net proceeds of our Initial Public Offering and the sale of the placement units released to us from the trust account upon the closing of our initial business combination may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete our initial business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemption of our public shares, we may use the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account following the closing for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. In addition, we may be required to obtain additional financing in connection with the closing of our initial business combination to be used following the closing for general corporate purposes as described above.
 
There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity or equity-linked securities or through loans, advances or other indebtedness in connection with our initial business combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our initial business combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise. None of our sponsors, officers, directors or stockholders is required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our initial business combination. We may also obtain financing prior to the closing of our initial business combination to fund our working capital needs and transaction costs in connection with our search for and completion of our initial business combination.
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we will be prohibited from issuing additional securities that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account; or (ii) vote as a class with our public shares: (a) on any initial business combination, or (b) to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to: (x) extend the time we have to consummate a business combination, or (y) amend the foregoing provisions, unless (in connection with any such amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation) we offer our public stockholders the opportunity to redeem their public shares
 
Employees
 
We currently have two officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they devote as much of their time as they deem necessary, in the exercise of their respective business judgement, to our affairs and intend to continue doing so until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that our officers or any members of our management team devote in any time period may vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the initial business combination process.
