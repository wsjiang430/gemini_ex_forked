Item 1. Business
Company Overview



We are fintech provider of digital payment solutions and services to businesses and consumers, focusing on the needs of unbanked and underserved communities, particularly migrant communities in the United States. We are focused on operating and developing “e-wallet” mobile applications that enable consumers to deposit cash, convert it into a digital form, and remit the funds to Mexico and other countries quickly and securely.



Our two initial e-wallet applications are IPSIPay® and Beyond Wallet. While Beyond Wallet is currently operational and is an institutional business-to-business product, we consider IPSIPay to be our flagship retail customer product and is the product we are presently dedicating most of our resources to developing and commercializing. IPSIPay was first “soft” launched in December 2021, and in September 2022, we announced completion of the key integration of IPSIPay and its back-end payment processing infrastructure through our commercial partners. This major achievement allows IPSIPay users the ability to easily transfer money and make payments through the IPSIPay app throughout five continents for receipt at more than 215,000 payment locations.



Our primary sources of revenue are commissions and fees from the download and use of our digital suite of products without physical custody of customer funds. While we began to generate some IPSIPay-related revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022, such revenues were nominal. Our goal is to increase our revenues from active users of IPSIPay during 2023.



2022 Business Developments



During 2022, we continued our efforts to both improve the features and functionality of IPSIPay while also augmenting our marketing efforts aimed at generating downloads and use of IPSIPay. In particular:

● | In April 2022, we announced the approval from VISA® for use of its debit card services as part of IPSIPay. This achievement provides IPSIPay users the ability to withdraw cash with minimal fees from their digital wallet using the VISA debit card in ATM machines. The IPSIPay VISA debit card also gives customers access to their money from a large merchant network around the world, providing the ability to make everyday purchases anywhere that accepts VISA cards. Simultaneously, the cards provide users with a bank account via Metropolitan Bank, thereby enabling a path for users to potentially establish or enhance their credit;

● | In July 2022, we announced an exclusive endorsement agreement with television personality Mario Lopez to increase awareness regarding our products. The goal of this collaboration is to highlight the challenges faced by the unbanked and underserved communities in the United States and Latin America emphasizing how our products can help address these challenges;

● | In August 2022, we announced a commercial relationship with DRUID, a leader in conversational artificial intelligence (“AI”), to provide various conversational AI technology to be integrated into IPSIPay. This collaboration will enable IPSIPay app users to conduct transactions and utilize other functions through voice command in addition to traditional touch screen interaction;

● | In October 2022, we announced the availability of Walmart Health Virtual Care (formerly known as MeMD) on IPSIPay, providing a comprehensive telemedicine offering to IPSIPay users;

● | In October 2022, we announced that since the initiation of our new marketing campaign in August 2022, we had achieved 10,000 downloads of our IPSIPay® app. Of the 10,000 downloads, 1,200 were converted to active users with wallets, meaning the users have initiated at least one transaction via IPSIPay. As December 31, 2022, we had achieved 31,004 downloads of IPSIPay, and of the 31,004 downloads, 2,686 have been converted to active users with wallets; and

● | In January 2023, we announced that (i) we initiated e-commerce collaborations that will grant IPSIPay users with access to providers like Best Buy and Groupon and (ii) we are working with our technology partners on IPSIPay 2.0. This new and upgraded app with the latest technological advances should be released in the second quarter of 2023. We also expect to announce during 2023 the addition of check capture, allowing IPSIPay users the ability to take a picture of their paycheck and have it immediately deposited into their IPSIPay wallet.

We are also creating an ecosystem that enables our business-to-business and business-to-consumer customers to move money, retain customers, and offer the cost savings, convenience and instant settlement that is associated with digital payments. In another new development, during the first quarter of 2023, we expect to file an application with the Government of Mexico for our Mexican MTO (money transmitting organization) which, if approved, will allow us to capture exchange rates, issue Visa and Mastercard debit cards and provide our services as an agent to companies in the U.S. looking to reach millions of customers in Mexico. Our Mexican MTO will also have the ability to move money in Mexico for Mexicans sending money to family and friends within the country. We believe our Mexican MTO will give us tremendous leverage in pricing our remittances to Mexico and better margins in sending money to Mexico.



Our Strategy and Market



We offer simple digital e-wallet and digital payment solutions. As a California-based fintech company, our initial launch efforts for IPSIPay and Beyond Wallet has been focused on the Central Valley region in California, which is the largest agricultural belt in the U.S. Our applications (which can be used both business-to-business and business-to-consumer) will facilitate the transfer of funds in digital form to other countries, initially Mexico but also, India and the Philippines, primarily from hand-held devices as well as on desktop or laptop computers. Our launch plan for IPSIPay and Beyond Wallet is to target lower income, migrant communities in California (notably in the agriculture industry), and expanding to other states with large migrant populations such as Texas and Florida.



We believe the money remittance business is changing after 50 years of an industry controlled by a very small number of large corporations. According to publicly available data from Statista, total global remittance payments are estimated to reach over $750 billion in 2023, and for the first time digital payments are estimated to exceed non-digital payments in 2023. We believe we are positioned to take advantage of this sea change with our applications while also emphasizing our humanitarian theme by focusing on the unbanked and underserved. Our ability to capture even a fraction of this massive global market represents our largest value proposition.



Our Apps and Business Model



Our primary sources of revenue (which have been nominal to date) are commissions and fees from the use of our digital suite of products without physical custody of customer funds. Our fully functional apps (which are available for download on Apple’s App Store, and the Google Play Store include the ability to use an e-wallet, Visa debit cards, bill payment platform, e-commerce and the ability to buy gold and silver. Our novel platforms allow us to incorporate stringent compliance features (including KYC (know your customer) and AML (anti-money laundering)) for onboarding of customers. This has enabled us to partner during 2022 with key third parties that drive the core functionality of our apps and has also allowed us to begin to expand our product offerings beyond money remittance into exciting other verticals. We expanded the functionality of IPSIPay in October 2022 when we announced the availability of Walmart Health Virtual Care (formerly known as MeMD), a comprehensive telemedicine offering, on IPSIPay. We believe we have the ability and technology to add micro-loans as well as payroll services to our apps in the future.



We are also committed to exploring the use of the KYC and AML-focused technology at the core of our apps to be used in other verticals such as the large and growing mobile gaming industry.



In addition to these revenue generators, we intend on releasing our BeyondAgro software to enable growers to improve business management and management of contract employees, particularly migrant workers. This will be offered as a monthly fee-based SaaS platform.



Our revenue will include fees derived from the use of debit cards, ATM fees, merchant processing fees, money transfer fees, commissions on international bill payments and, in the future micro-loans.



Marketing



We are focusing our initial marketing efforts on the unbanked and underserved labor markets, initially focusing on the Californian agriculture industry to acquire customers for our IPSIPay and Beyond Wallet apps. We will use direct social media marketing strategies to the business to consumer market. We will also employ our paid marketing campaign with television personality Mario Lopez. We have also utilized financial promotional strategies to encourage downloads and use of IPSIPay, which has reduced our ability to generate revenues in the near term while such strategies are in effect.

Competition



The payment service business is highly competitive and continued growth depends on our ability to compete effectively. Companies like Western Union, Money Gram, Paypal, and Venmo, dominate the money remittance business, and most of our competitors have far greater sources of financing, greater name recognition and have been engaged in the industry longer than we have. We believe, however that the differentiator with the IPSIPay and Beyond Wallet apps is our ability to provide the unbanked and under-served the ability to transact without the use of a traditional bank account, with greater convenience, lower costs and instant settlement, and with free wallet-to-wallet transfers, and the ability to upload funds onto Visa debit cards across borders. We believe the design of our apps will be highly attractive to our initial target communities, thus allowing our product to compete effectively.
Intellectual Property



We rely on a combination of contractual rights (notably through our commercial relationship with Frictionless Financial Technologies, Inc. (“Frictionless”)), copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to establish and protect our technology and the technology that we license and/or that we may develop in the future. We presently have three trademark applications on file and under review, and our 51% subsidiary Beyond Fintech has an additional three trademark applications on file and under review.
Government and Environmental Regulation and Laws



We act as a facilitator between consumers and finance product providers, and therefore operate in a highly regulated industry. While we do not believe that our core business as a facilitator presently is subject to significant government regulation our finance product providers are subject to a variety of regulations aimed at preventing money laundering and financing criminal activity and terrorism, financial services regulations, payment services regulations, consumer protection laws, currency control regulations, advertising laws and privacy and data protection laws and therefore may expect to experience periodic investigations by various regulatory authorities in connection with the same, which may sometimes result in monetary or other sanctions being imposed upon them. Many of these laws and regulations are constantly evolving and are often unclear and inconsistent with other applicable laws and regulations, making compliance challenging, and may indirectly increase our operating costs and legal risks (or directly should it be determined that our business model is or becomes subject to more extensive regulation). Any violations of any of the foregoing or similar laws, rules or regulations could adversely affect our ability to maintain IPSIPay and Beyond Wallet, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.



Human Capital/Employees



As of December 31, 2022, we had 3 full time employees, including our Chief Executive Officer and our President and Chief Financial Officer and 2 part-time employees or consultants. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our employee relations to be good.



Our Corporate History and Background



We were incorporated on September 25, 2013 under the laws of the State of Nevada originally under the name Asiya Pearls, Inc. On May 27, 2016, Asiya Pearls, Inc. filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation to change its name from Asiya Pearls, Inc. to QPAGOS.



On May 12, 2016, we (at that time, under the name QPAGOS), entered into the Merger Agreement with Qpagos Corporation, and Merger Sub. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on May 12, 2016, the merger was consummated, and Qpagos Corporation and Merger Sub merged, with Qpagos Corporation continuing as the surviving corporation of the Merger.



Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, upon consummation of the Merger, each share of Qpagos Corporation’s capital stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger was converted into the right to receive two shares of our Common Stock. Additionally, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, upon consummation of the Merger, we assumed all of Qpagos Corporation’s warrants issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger, which were exercisable for approximately 621,920 shares of Common Stock, respectively, as of the date of the Merger. Prior to and as a condition to the closing of the Merger, the then-current stockholder of 500,000 shares of Common Stock agreed to return to us 497,500 shares of Common Stock held by such holder and the then-current stockholder retained an aggregate of 2,500 shares of Common Stock and the other stockholders retained 500,000 shares of Common Stock. Therefore, immediately following the Merger, Qpagos Corporation’s former stockholders held 4,992,900 shares of Common Stock which represented approximately 91% of the then outstanding Common Stock.

The Merger was treated as a reverse acquisition of our company, which was then a public shell company, for financial accounting and reporting purposes. As such, Qpagos Corporation was treated as the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes while IPSI was treated as the acquired entity for accounting and financial reporting purposes.



Qpagos Corporation was incorporated on May 1, 2015 under the laws of the state of Delaware to effectuate a reverse merger transaction with Qpagos Mexico and Redpag. Each of the entities were incorporated in November 2013 in Mexico.



Qpagos Mexico was formed to process payment transactions for service providers it contracts with, and Redpag was formed to deploy and operate kiosks as a distributor. 



On June 1, 2016, our Board of Directors changed our fiscal year end from October 31 to December 31.



On November 1, 2019, we changed our name from QPAGOS to Innovative Payment Solutions, Inc. Additionally, and immediately following the name change, we filed a Certificate of Change with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to affect the Reverse Stock Split. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, each ten pre-split shares of Common Stock outstanding automatically combined into one new share of Common Stock without any further action on the part of the holders, and the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock was reduced from 320,477,867 shares to 32,047,817 after rounding for fractional shares.



On December 31, 2019, we consummated the disposal of Qpagos Corporation, Qpagos Mexico and Redpag in exchange for 2,250,000 Vivi Shares of common stock of Vivi Holdings pursuant to the SPA dated August 5, 2019. Of the 2,250,000 shares of Vivi, nine percent (9%) was allocated as follows: Gaston Pereira (5%), Andrey Novikov (2.5%), and Joseph Abrams (1.5%). The SPA closed on December 31, 2019 after the satisfaction of customary conditions, the receipt of a final fairness opinion and the approval of our shareholders. As a result of this transaction, we no longer have any Mexican subsidiaries.



Pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement dated June 22, 2021 (the “Frictionless SPA”) , we acquired a 10% common stock interest in Frictionless. Frictionless agreed to deliver to us, a live, fully compliant financial payment Software as a Service solution for use by us as a digital payment platform that enables payments within the United States and abroad, including Mexico, together with a service agreement providing a full suite of product services to facilitate our anticipated product offerings. Under the terms of the Frictionless SPA, we were granted irrevocable rights to (i) participate up to fifty percent (50%) in future financings of Frictionless and (ii) acquire up to an additional 41% of the outstanding common stock of Frictionless at a purchase price of $300,000 for each 1% acquired. Further, pursuant to the Frictionless SPA, we agreed to issue to Frictionless or its designees a non-restricted, non-dilutable, five year warrant to purchase 30,000,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.15 per share based on the delivery of the financial payment software in accordance with the SPA. On December 30, 2022, we issued a warrant to Frictionless in satisfaction of this obligation. Due to the pricing of financings undertaken by us between the date of the Frictionless SPA and the date the warrant was granted, the exercise price of the warrant was set upon issuance at $0.0115 per share. Further, the warrant issued to Frictionless was for restricted shares of common stock and the “non-dilutable” provision was omitted. 



On August 26, 2021, we formed a new subsidiary, Beyond Fintech to acquire a product known as Beyond Wallet from a third party, together with the logo, use of name and implementation of the product into our technology. We own 51% of Beyond Fintech with the other 49% owned by Frictionless.
