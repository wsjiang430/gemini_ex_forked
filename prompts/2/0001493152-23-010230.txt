ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We were formed in April 26, 2013 as a technology platform developer under the name MassRoots, Inc. In October 2021, we changed our corporate name from “MassRoots, Inc.” to “Greenwave Technology Solutions, Inc.” We sold all of our social media assets on October 28, 2021 for cash consideration equal to $10,000 and has discontinued all operations related to its social media business. On September 30, 2021, we closed our acquisition of Empire Services, Inc. (“Empire”), which operates 14 metal recycling facilities in Virginia, North Carolina, and Ohio. The acquisition was effective October 1, 2021 upon the effectiveness of the Certificate of Merger in Virginia.
 
Upon the acquisition of Empire, we transitioned into the scrap metal industry which involves collecting, classifying and processing appliances, construction material, end-of-life vehicles, boats, and industrial machinery. We process these items by crushing, shearing, shredding, separating, and sorting, into smaller pieces and categorize these recycled ferrous, nonferrous, and mixed metal pieces based on density and metal prior to sale. In cases of scrap cars, we remove the catalytic converters, aluminum wheels, and batteries for separate processing and sale prior to shredding the vehicle. We have designed our systems to maximize the value of metals produced from this process.
 
We operate an automotive shredder at our Kelford, North Carolina location and a second automotive shredder at our Carrollton, Virginia is expected to come online in the second quarter of 2023. Our shredders are designed to produce a denser product and, in concert with advanced separation equipment, more refined recycled ferrous metals, which are more valuable as they require less processing to produce recycled steel products. In totality, this process reduces large metal objects like auto bodies into baseball-sized pieces of shredded recycled metal.
 
The shredded pieces are then placed on a conveyor belt under magnetized drums to separate the ferrous metal from the mixed nonferrous metal and residue, producing consistent and high-quality ferrous scrap metal. The nonferrous metals and other materials then go through a number of additional mechanical systems which separate the nonferrous metal from any residue. The remaining nonferrous metal is further processed to sort the metal by type, grade, and quality prior to being sold as products, such as zorba (mainly aluminum), zurik (mainly stainless steel), and shredded insulated wire (mainly copper and aluminum).
 
One of our main corporate priorities is to open a facility with rail or deep-water port access to enable us to efficiently transport our products to domestic steel mills and overseas foundries. Because this would greatly expand the number of potential buyers of our processed scrap products, we believe opening a facility with port or rail access could result in an increase in both the revenue and profitability of our existing operations.

Empire is headquartered in Chesapeake, Virginia and employs 143 people as of March 21, 2023.
 
Background
 
We were incorporated in the state of Delaware on April 26, 2013 as a technology platform. Our principal executive office is located at 4016 Raintree Rd, Ste 300, Chesapeake, VA 23321, and our telephone number is (757) 966-1432.
 
On January 25, 2017, we consummated a reverse triangular merger (the “Whaxy Merger”) pursuant to which we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of DDDigtal Inc. d.b.a. Whaxy (“DDDigtal”), a Colorado corporation. Upon closing of the Whaxy Merger, each share of DDDigtal’s common stock was exchanged for such number of shares of our common stock (or a fraction thereof) based on an exchange ratio equal to approximately 5.273-for-1, such that 1 share of our common stock was issued for every 5.273 shares of DDDigtal’s common stock. At the closing of the Whaxy Merger, all shares of common stock of our newly-formed merger subsidiary formed for the sole purpose of effectuating the Whaxy Merger, were converted into and exchanged for one share of common stock of DDDigtal, and all shares of DDDigtal’s common stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the Whaxy Merger were automatically cancelled and retired. Upon the closing of the Whaxy Merger, DDDigtal continued as our surviving wholly-owned subsidiary, and the merger subsidiary ceased to exist.
 
On July 13, 2017, we consummated a reverse triangular merger (the “Odava Merger”) pursuant to which we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Odava Inc. (“Odava”), a Delaware corporation. Upon closing of the Odava Merger, each share of Odava’s common stock was exchanged for such number of shares of our common stock (or a fraction thereof), based on an exchange ratio equal to approximately 4.069-for-1, such that 1 share of our common stock was issued for every 4.069 shares of Odava’s common stock. At the closing of the Odava Merger, all shares of common stock of our newly-formed merger subsidiary formed for the sole purpose of effectuating the Odava Merger, were converted into and exchanged for one share of common stock of Odava, and all shares of Odava’s common stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the Odava Merger automatically cancelled and retired. Upon the closing of the Odava Merger, Odava continued as our surviving wholly-owned subsidiary, and the merger subsidiary ceased to exist.
 
On October 1, 2021, we consummated a reverse triangular merger (the “Empire Merger”) pursuant to which we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Empire Services, Inc. (“Empire”), a Virginia corporation. Upon closing of the Empire Merger, all of the shares of Empire’s common stock was exchanged for 1,650,000 shares of our common stock. At the closing of the Empire Merger, all shares of common stock of our newly-formed merger subsidiary formed for the sole purpose of effectuating the Empire Merger, were converted into and exchanged for one share of common stock of Empire, and all shares of Empire’s common stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the Empire Merger automatically cancelled and retired. Upon the closing of the Empire Merger, Empire continued as our surviving wholly-owned subsidiary, and the merger subsidiary ceased to exist.

Products and Services
 
Our main product is selling ferrous metal, which is used in the recycling and production of finished steel. It is categorized into heavy melting steel, plate and structural, and shredded scrap, with various grades of each of those categorized based on the content, size and consistency of the metal. All of these attributes affect the metal’s value.
 
We also process nonferrous metals such as aluminum, copper, stainless steel, nickel, brass, titanium, lead, alloys and mixed metal products. Additionally, we sell the catalytic converters recovered from end-of-life vehicles to processors which extract the nonferrous precious metals such as platinum, palladium and rhodium.
 
We provide metal recycling services to a wide range of suppliers, including large corporations, industrial manufacturers, retail customers, and government organizations.
 
Pricing and Customers
 
Prices for our ferrous and nonferrous products are based on prevailing market rates and are subject to market cycles, worldwide steel demand, government regulations and policy, and supply of products that can be processed into recycled steel. Our main buyers adjust the prices they pay for scrap metal products based on market rates usually on a monthly or bi-weekly basis. We are usually paid for the scrap metal we deliver to customers within 14 days of delivery.
 
Based on any price changes from our customers or our other buyers, we in turn adjust the price for unprocessed scrap we pay suppliers in order to manage the impact on our operating income and cashflows.
 
The spread we are able to realize between the sales prices and the cost of purchasing scrap metal is determined by a number of factors, including transportation and processing costs. Historically, we have experienced sustained periods of stable or rising metal selling prices, which allow us to manage or increase our operating income. When selling prices decline, we adjust the prices we pay customers to minimize the impact to our operating income.
 
Sources of Unprocessed Metal
 
Our main sources of unprocessed metal we purchase are end-of-life vehicles, old equipment, appliances and other consumer goods, and scrap metal from construction or manufacturing operations. We acquire this unprocessed metal from a wide base of suppliers including large corporations, industrial manufacturers, retail customers, and government organizations who unload their metal at our facilities or we pick it up and transport it from the supplier’s location. Currently, our operations and main suppliers are located in the Hampton Roads and northeastern North Carolina markets. In the second quarter of 2023, we are expanding our operations by opening a metal recycling facility in Cleveland, Ohio.
 
Our supply of scrap metal is influenced by overall health of economic activity in the United States, changes in prices for recycled metal, and, to a lesser extent, seasonal factors such as severe weather conditions, which may prohibit or inhibit scrap metal collection.
 
Technology
 
In May 2021, we launched our new website. For the first time, Empire’s customers can see the current prices for each type of scrap metal. Our website is also integrated with Google’s Business Profiles, listing many of Empire’s locations on Google for the first time. In late May 2021, the Empire launched a junk car buying platform, where people looking to sell their scrap cars can get a quote within minutes, and integrated Google Ads, enabling Empire to micro-target their advertising based on location, age, income, and other factors.
 
Additionally, during 2021, the Company moved the operations of each of their yards to WeighPay, a cloud-based Enterprise Resource Planning “ERP” system, which enables management to track sales, inventory, and operations at each facility in real time, while also establishing stronger internal controls and systems. Additionally, in 2021, the Company moved Empire’s accounting systems over to a cloud-based QuickBooks to facilitate collaboration and further growth.

The technology systems and improvements Empire implemented have resulted in a significant increase in new customers, hundreds of quotes and dozens of purchases of junk cars, and we believe a material increase in Empire’s revenues as a result of these improvements. These systems have also streamlined Empire’s accounting and internal operations to enable any future acquisitions to be closed quickly and efficiently. Lastly, through the data-driven decision processes that have been introduced, Empire’s strategy on future locations and pricing is being informed by accurate and relevant data.
 
Now that strong foundational systems are in place, management has begun to repurpose Greenwave’s technology platform that it developed from 2013 to 2020 into a marketing and CRM platform for scrap metal yards. This system will enable each facility to:
 

● | Send text and email updates and special deals to their customers; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Implement a points-based rewards system; 
● | Enable consumers to view scrap metal yards in their local area along with prices; 
● | Receive quotes for junk cars in real-time; 
● | Leave and respond to reviews of scrap yards; and 
● | View analytics and conversion data. 

 
Over the past ten years, Greenwave has invested approximately $10 million developing these technologies which we believe we can re-purpose for a fraction of the cost of development, give our metal recycling facilities and those who pay to use our platform a significant competitive advantage, and grow our revenues and profits as a result.
 
There are few companies developing technology solutions for the scrap metal industry and we believe that by focusing our experience and assets on this highly-profitable but often overlooked industry, we can create significant value for our shareholders.
 
Competition
 
We compete with several large, well-financed recyclers of scrap metal, steel mills which own their own scrap metal processing operations, and with smaller metal recycling companies. Demand for metal products are sensitive to global economic conditions, the relative value of the U.S. dollar, and availability of material alternatives, including recycled metal substitutes. Prices for recycled metal are also influenced by tariffs, quotas, and other import restrictions, and by licensing and government requirements.
 
We aim to create a competitive advantage through our ability to process significant volumes of metal products, our use of processing and separation equipment, the number and location of our facilities, and the operating synergies we have been able to develop based on our experience.
 
Recent Developments
 
In July 2022, the Company’s common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”). Simultaneously with the listing of the Company’s common stock on Nasdaq on July 22, 2022, the Company’s senior secured convertible notes in the principal amount of $37,714,966 together with accrued interest in the amount of $1,470,884 were converted into shares of common stock at a conversion price of $6.02 per share.
 
In November 2022, we opened a metal recycling facility in Fairmont, NC.
 
In January 2023, we leased a property in Chesapeake, VA.
 
In April 2023, we are opening a metal recycling facility in Cleveland, Ohio.
