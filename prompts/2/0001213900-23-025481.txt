Item 1. Business
Overview



GD Culture Group Limited (“GDC” or the “Company”, formerly known as JM Global Holding Company, TMSR Holding Company Limited and Code Chain New Continent Limited) is a holding company with no material operations of its own. We currently conduct business through Shanghai Highlight Media Co., Ltd. (“Highlight Media”). Highlight WFOE is the primary beneficiary of Highlight Media for accounting purposes, because, pursuant to certain VIE agreements between Highlight WFOE, Highlight Media and shareholders of Highlight Media, Highlight Media shall pay Highlight WFOE service fees in the amount of 100% of Highlight Media’s net income, while Highlight WFOE is obligated to absorb all of losses of Highlight Media. As a result, we consolidate the financial results of Highlight Media in our consolidated financial statements under U.S. GAAP. Such VIE structure involves unique risks to investors. The VIE agreements have not been tested in a court of law and the Chinese regulatory authorities could disallow this VIE structure, which would likely result in a material change in our operations and the value of our securities, including that it could cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or become worthless. For more details on the VIE structure, please see “Item 1. Business – Corporate Structure - Contractual Arrangements between Highlight Media and Highlight WFOE” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure”.



Highlight Media, founded in 2016, is an integrated marketing service agency, focusing on serving businesses in China in connection with brand management, image building, public relations, social media management and event planning. Highlight Media is committed to becoming a modern technology media organization that provide clients with customized services. Its growth strategy is substantially dependent upon our ability to market our intended products and services successfully to prospective clients in China. This requires that we heavily rely upon our sales and marketing team and marketing partners. Failure to reach potential clients will significantly affect our results of operation and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and the results of our operations.



Prior to September 28, 2022, we were also engaged in research, development and application of Internet of Things (IoT) and electronic tokens Wuge digital door signs through Wuge Network Games Co., Ltd. (“Wuge”), a then VIE of the Company. On September 28, 2022, the Company entered into a termination agreement with Wuge and the shareholders of Wuge, i.e., Wei Xu, former Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board of the Company, and Bibo Lin, former Vice President and Director of the Company, and two entities controlled by Wei Xu, to terminate certain technical consultation and services agreement., equity pledge agreement, equity option agreement, voting rights proxy and financial support agreement, by and among Makesi WFOE, Wuge and the shareholders of Wuge. As a result, Wuge ceased to be a VIE of Makesi WFOE and operations of Wuge have been designated as discontinued operations. In exchange for such termination, on March 9, 2023, the Company cancelled 133,333 shares of common stock, after giving effect to the 1-to-30 reverse stock split which became effective on November 9, 2022 (see “– Corporate History and Structure – Reverse Stock Split” for more details) that were issued to the shareholders  of Wuge in January 2020.

Reverse Stock Split



On November 4, 2022, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation (the “Certificate of Amendment”) with the Nevada Secretary of State to effect a reverse stock split of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per shares, of the Company at a ratio of one-for-thirty (30), which became effective at 12:01 a.m. on November 9, 2022. Upon effectiveness of the reverse stock split, every thirty (30) outstanding shares of common stock were combined into and automatically become one share of common stock. The Company’s warrants (OTC Pink: CCNCW) was adjusted so that each warrant is to purchase one-half of one shares of Common Stock at a price of $86.40 per half share ($172.50 per whole share). The warrants expired on February 5, 2023.



Unless otherwise indicated, all references to common stock, warrants to purchase common stock, share data, per share data, and related information have been retroactively adjusted, where applicable, in this annual report to reflect the reverse stock split of our common stock as if they had occurred at the beginning of the earlier period presented.



Name Change



Effective as of January 10, 2023, the Company changed its corporate name from “Code Chain New Continent Limited” to “GD Culture Group Limited” pursuant to a Certificate of Amendment to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation. In connection with the name change, effective as of the opening of trading on January 10, 2023, the Company’s common stock is trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol “GDC”.

Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic



The COVID-19 pandemic did not have a material impact on our business or results of operation during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. However, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively impact the general economy and our business is highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. These uncertainties may impede our ability to conduct our operations and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and as a result could adversely affect our stock price and create more volatility.



Recent Regulatory Developments



On January 4, 2022, the Cyberspace Administration of China, or CAC, issued the revised Measures on Cyberspace Security Review (the “Revised Measures”), which came into effect on February 15, 2022. Under the Revised Measures, any “network platform operator” controlling personal information of no less than one million users which seeks to list in a foreign stock exchange should also be subject to cyber security review.



We believe neither Highlight Media is not a “network platform operator” who control over one million personal information as mentioned above, given that: (i) Highlight Media does not possess a large amount of personal information in our business operations and (ii) data processed in Highlight Media’s business does not have a bearing on national security and thus may not be classified as core or important data by the authorities. As such, we believe Highlight Media is not currently subject to the cyber security review by the CAC. However, the definition of “network platform operator” is unclear and it is also unclear on how it will be interpreted and implemented by the relevant PRC governmental authorities. See “Risk factors — Risk Factors Related to Doing Business in China — Highlight Media may become subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the PRC regarding privacy, data security, cybersecurity, and data protection. Highlight Media may be required to suspend its business, be liable for improper use or appropriation of personal information provided by our customers or face other penalties.”

On July 6, 2021, the relevant PRC governmental authorities made public the Opinions on Strictly Cracking Down Illegal Securities Activities in Accordance with the Law. These opinions emphasized the need to strengthen the administration over illegal securities activities and the supervision on overseas listings by China-based companies and proposed to take effective measures, such as promoting the construction of relevant regulatory systems to deal with the risks and incidents faced by China-based overseas-listed companies. As these opinions are recently issued, official guidance and related implementation rules have not been issued yet and the interpretation of these opinions remains unclear at this stage. As of the date of this annual report, we have not received any inquiry, notice, warning, or sanctions regarding listing abroad or offshore offering from the China Securities Regulatory Commission (“CSRC”) or any other PRC governmental authorities. See “Risk Factors — Risk Factors Related to Doing Business in China — The Chinese government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities. We are currently not required to obtain approval from Chinese authorities to list on U.S exchanges, however, if Highlight Media or GDC were required to obtain approval in the future and were denied permission from Chinese authorities to list on U.S. exchanges, we will not be able to continue listing on U.S. exchange and the value of our common stock may significantly decline or become worthless, which would materially affect the interest of the investors.”



On December 24, 2021, CSRC issued Provisions of the State Council on the Administration of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (Draft for Comments) (the “Administration Provisions”), and the Administrative Measures for the Filing of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (the “Measures”), which are open for public comments by January 23, 2022. The Administration Provisions and Measures for overseas listings lay out specific requirements for filing documents and include unified regulation management, strengthening regulatory coordination, and cross-border regulatory cooperation. Domestic companies seeking to list abroad must carry out relevant security screening procedures if their businesses involve supervisions such as foreign investment security and cyber security reviews. Companies endangering national security are among those off-limits for overseas listings. According to Relevant Officials of the CSRC Answered Reporter Questions (“CSRC Answers”), after the Administration Provisions and Measures are implemented upon completion of public consultation and due legislative procedures, the CSRC will formulate and issue guidance for filing procedures to further specify the details of filing administration and ensure that market entities could refer to clear guidelines for filing, which means it will still take time to put the Administration Provisions and Measures into effect. As the Administration Provisions and Measures have not yet come into effect, we are currently unaffected by them. However, according to CSRC Answers, only new initial public offerings and refinancing by existing overseas listed Chinese companies will be required to go through the filing process; other existing overseas listed companies will be allowed a sufficient transition period to complete their filing procedure. However, it is uncertain when the Administration Provision and the Measures will take effect or if they will take effect as currently drafted.



On February 17, 2023, the CSRC released the Trial Administrative Measures for Administration of Overseas Securities Offerings and Listings by Domestic Companies (the “Trial Measures”) and five supporting guidelines, which came into effect on March 31, 2023. Pursuant to the Trial Measures, domestic companies that seek to offer or list securities overseas, both directly and indirectly, should fulfill the filing procedures and report relevant information to the CSRC. If a domestic company fails to complete the filing procedures or conceals any material fact or falsifies any major content in its filing documents, such domestic company may be subject to administrative penalties by the CSRC, such as order to rectify, warnings, fines, and its controlling shareholders, actual controllers, the person directly in charge and other directly liable persons may also be subject to administrative penalties, such as warnings and fines. As a listed company, we believe that we, all of our PRC subsidiaries and the consolidated VIEs are not required to fulfill filing procedures with the CSRC to continue to offer our securities, or continue listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, or operate business of the consolidated VIEs as of the date of this annual report. However, there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of the Regulation on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Companies by Foreign Investors (“M&A Rules”), other PRC Laws and future PRC laws and regulations, and there can be no assurance that any governmental agency will not take a view that is contrary to or otherwise different from our belief stated herein. See “Risk Factors - Risk Factors Relating to Doing Business in China - The CSRC has released the Trial Measures for Administration of Overseas Securities Offerings and Listings by Domestic Companies (the “Trial Measures”). While such rules have not yet gone into effect, the Chinese government may exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas and foreign investment in China-based issuers, which could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to continue to offer our securities to investors and could cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or become worthless.”



We believe that we are currently not required to obtain any permission or approval from the CSRC and the CAC in the PRC to issue securities to foreign investors. However, there is no guarantee that this will continue to be the case in the future in relation to any future offerings of our company or the continued listing of our company’s securities on the Nasdaq Capital Market, or even in the event such permission or approval is required and obtained, it will not be subsequently revoked or rescinded. If we do not receive or maintain the approvals, or we inadvertently conclude that such approvals are not required, or applicable laws, regulations, or interpretations change such that we are required to obtain approval in the future, we may be subject to an investigation by competent regulators, fines or penalties, or an order prohibiting us from conducting an offering, and these risks could result in a material adverse change in our operations and the value of our securities, significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors, or cause such securities to significantly decline in value or become worthless.

Implication of the Holding Foreign Company Accountable Act



The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or the HFCAA, was enacted on December 18, 2020. The HFCAA states that if the SEC determines that an issuer’s audit reports issued by a registered public accounting firm have not been subject to inspection by the PCAOB for three consecutive years beginning in 2021, the SEC shall prohibit such issuer’s securities from being traded on a national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter trading market in the United States. On March 24, 2021, the SEC adopted interim final rules relating to the implementation of certain disclosure and documentation requirements of the HFCAA. We will be required to comply with these rules if the SEC identifies us as having a “non-inspection” year under a process to be subsequently established by the SEC. If we fail to meet the new rules before the deadline specified thereunder, we could face possible prohibition from trading on the OTCQB, deregistration from the SEC and/or other risks, which may materially and adversely affect, or effectively terminate, our securities trading in the United States. On December 2, 2021, the SEC issued amendments to finalize rules implementing the submission and disclosure requirements in the HFCAA. The rules apply to registrants that the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report with an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction and that PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by an authority in foreign jurisdictions. Furthermore, on June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, and on December 29, 2022, legislation entitled “Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023” (the “Consolidated Appropriations Act”) was signed into law by President Biden, which contained, among other things, an identical provision to the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act and amended the HFCAA by requiring the SEC to prohibit an issuer’s securities from trading on any U.S. stock exchanges if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections for two consecutive years instead of three, thus reducing the time period for triggering the prohibition on trading. On August 26, 2022, the CSRC, the Ministry of Finance of the PRC (the “MOF”), and the PCAOB signed a Statement of Protocol (the “Protocol”), governing inspections and investigations of audit firms based in mainland China and Hong Kong, taking the first step toward opening access for the PCAOB to inspect and investigate registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong. Pursuant to the fact sheet with respect to the Protocol disclosed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), the PCAOB shall have independent discretion to select any issuer audits for inspection or investigation and has the unfettered ability to transfer information to the SEC. On December 15, 2022, the PCAOB Board determined that the PCAOB was able to secure complete access to inspect and investigate registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong and voted to vacate its previous determinations to the contrary. However, should PRC authorities obstruct or otherwise fail to facilitate the PCAOB’s access in the future, the PCAOB Board will consider the need to issue a new determination. 



Our auditor prior to October 2022, WWC, P.C. had been inspected by the PCAOB on a regular basis in the audit period. Our current auditor, Enrome LLP, has been inspected by the PCAOB on a regular basis as well. If it is later determined that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate our auditor completely, investors may be deprived of the benefits of such inspection. Any audit reports not issued by auditors that are completely inspected by the PCAOB, or a lack of PCAOB inspections of audit work undertaken in China that prevents the PCAOB from regularly evaluating our auditors’ audits and their quality control procedures, could result in a lack of assurance that our financial statements and disclosures are adequate and accurate. Moreover, if trading in our securities is prohibited under the HFCAA in the future because the PCAOB determines that it cannot inspect or fully investigate our auditor at such future time, an exchange may determine to delist our securities. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing Business in China  — The recent joint statement by the SEC and PCAOB, proposed rule changes submitted by Nasdaq, and the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act all call for additional and more stringent criteria to be applied to emerging market companies”



Consolidation 



We conduct all of our business in China through Highlight Media. Highlight WFOE is the primary beneficiary of Highlight Media for accounting purposes, because, pursuant to the VIE agreements, Highlight Media shall pay Highlight WFOE service fees in the amount of 100% of Highlight Media’s net income, while Highlight WFOE is obligated to absorb all of losses of Highlight Media. As a result, we consolidate the financial results of Highlight Media in our consolidated financial statements under U.S. GAAP.



The following tables present selected condensed consolidated financial data of the company and its subsidiaries and the VIE for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and balance sheet data as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, which have been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements for those years.

February 2021 Offering



Registered Direct Offering and Private Placement



On February 18, 2021, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”) with certain purchasers, pursuant to which, on February 22, 2021, we sold (i) 138,889 shares of common stock, (ii) registered warrants (the “Registered Warrants”) to purchase an aggregate of up to 54,646 shares of common stock and (iii) unregistered warrants (the “Unregistered Warrants”) to purchase up to 84,244 shares (the “Warrant Shares”) of common stock in a registered direct offering (the “Registered Direct Offering”) and a concurrent private placement (the “Private Placement,” and together with the Registered Direct Offering, the “Offering”). The terms of the Offering were previously reported in a Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 18, 2021 and the closing of the Offering was reported in a Form 8-K filed with the Commission on February 22, 2021.



The gross proceeds of the Offering of $24,999,996, before deducting placement agent fees and other expenses, are being used for working capital and general business purposes.



The Registered Warrants have a term of five years and are exercisable immediately at an exercise price of $201,60 per share, subject to adjustments thereunder, including a reduction in the exercise price, in the event of a subsequent offering at a price less than the then current exercise price, to the same price as the price in such offering (a “Price Protection Adjustment”).



The Unregistered Warrants have a term of five and one-half years and are first exercisable on the date that is the earlier of (i) six months after the date of issuance or (ii) the date on which the Company obtains stockholder approval approving the sale of the securities sold under the Securities Purchase Agreement, to purchase an aggregate of up to 84,244 shares of common stock. The Unregistered Warrants have an exercise price of $201.60 per share, subject to adjustments thereunder, including (x) a Price Protection Adjustment and (y) in the event the exercise price is more than $183.00, a reduction of the exercise price to $183.00, upon obtaining such stockholder approval.



The Offering was conducted pursuant to a placement agency agreement, dated February 18, 2021 (the “Placement Agency Agreement”), between the Company and Univest Securities, LLC (the “Placement Agent”), on a “reasonable best efforts” basis. The Company paid the Placement Agent a cash fee of $2,310,000, including $2,000,000 in commission which was equal to eight percent (8.0%) of the aggregate gross proceeds raised in this Offering, $250,000 in non-accountable expense which was equal to one percent (1%) of the aggregate gross proceeds raised in the Offering, and $60,000 in accountable expenses. Additionally, the Company issued to the Placement Agent warrants to purchase up to 6,945 shares of common stock, with a term of five years first exercisable six months after the date of issuance and at an exercise price of $180.00 per share.



Stockholder Approval



Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, we are required to hold a meeting of our stockholders not later than April 29, 2021 to seek such approval as may be required from our stockholders (the “Stockholder Approval”), in accordance with applicable law, the applicable rules and regulations of the Nasdaq Stock Market, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the Nevada Revised Statutes with respect to the issuance of the securities in the Offering, including the Warrants sold in the Private Placement, so that the issuance by us of shares of common stock in excess of the 231,802 shares (19.99% of the shares of common stock outstanding as of February 17, 2021, the date prior to entering into the Securities Purchase Agreement) in the aggregate (the “Issuable Maximum”), will be in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rules 5635(a) and 5635(d) as described herein, and investors in the Offering will be able to exercise the Warrants prior to six months after the closing of the Offering.

Nasdaq Compliance



On May 5, 2022, the Company received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market regarding the Company’s failure to comply with Nasdaq Continued Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), which requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share. A failure to comply with Rule 5550(a)(2) exists when listed securities fail to maintain a closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days. Based on the closing bid price for the last 30 consecutive business days (including, in particular, the period March 23, 2022 through May 4, 2022), the Company failed to meet the aforesaid requirement.



On November 2, 2022, the Company received a written notice from Nasdaq (stating that, although the Company had not regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement by November 1, 2022, in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company is eligible for an additional 180 calendar day period, or until May 1, 2023, to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). To regain compliance, the closing bid price of the Company’s common stock must meet or exceed $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days during this 180-day period.



On November 28, 2022, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq stating that because the Company’s common stock had a closing bid price at or above $1.00 per share for 10 consecutive business days, the Company had regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement of $1.00 per share for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), and that the matter is now closed.



Environmental Matters



As of December 31, 2022, Highlight Media was not subject to any fines or legal action involving non-compliance with any relevant environmental regulation, nor are we aware of any threatened or pending action, including by any environmental regulatory authority.
Governmental Regulations



Business license



Any company that conducts business in the PRC must have a business license that covers a particular type of work. Highlight Media’s business license covers its present business of Book Publishing Planning, Financial Self-Media and Public Relations. Prior to expanding Highlight Media’s business beyond that of its business license, Highlight Media is required to apply and receive approval from the PRC government.



Employment laws



We and Highlight Media are subject to laws and regulations governing our relationship with our employees, including: wage and hour requirements, working and safety conditions, citizenship requirements, work permits and travel restrictions. These include local labor laws and regulations, which may require substantial resources for compliance. China’s National Labor Law, which became effective on January 1, 1995, and amended on August 27, 2009, and China’s National Labor Contract Law, which became effective on January 1, 2008, and amended on December 28, 2012, permit workers in both state and private enterprises in China to bargain collectively. The National Labor Law and the National Labor Contract Law provide for collective contracts to be developed through collaboration between the labor union (or worker representatives in the absence of a union) and management that specify such matters as working conditions, wage scales, and hours of work. The laws also permit workers and employers in all types of enterprises to sign individual contracts, which are to be drawn up in accordance with the collective contract.

Intellectual property protection in China



Patent. The PRC has domestic laws for the protection of copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade secrets. The PRC is also signatory to some of the world’s major intellectual property conventions, including:

● | Convention establishing the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO Convention) (June 4, 1980);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property (March 19, 1985);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Patent Cooperation Treaty (January 1, 1994); and
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) (November 11, 2001).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Patents in the PRC are governed by the China Patent Law and its Implementing Regulations, each of which went into effect in 1985. Amended versions of the China Patent Law and its Implementing Regulations came into effect in 1993, 2001 and 2009, respectively.



The PRC is signatory to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, in accordance with which any person who has duly filed an application for a patent in one signatory country shall enjoy, for the purposes of filing in the other countries, a right of priority during the period fixed in the convention (12 months for inventions and utility models, and 6 months for industrial designs).



The Patent Law covers three kinds of patents — patents for inventions, utility models and designs. The Chinese patent system adopts the principle of first to file, which means that a patent may be granted only to the person who first files an application. Consistent with international practice, the PRC allows the patenting of inventions or utility models that possess the characteristics of novelty, inventiveness and practical applicability only. For a design to be patentable it cannot be identical with, or similar to, any design which, before the date of filing, has been publicly disclosed in publications in the country or abroad or has been publicly used in the country, and should not be in conflict with any prior right of another.



Copyright. Copyright in the PRC, including copyrighted software, is principally protected under the Copyright Law of the PRC and related rules and regulations. Under the Copyright Law, the term of protection for copyrighted software is 50 years.
Trademark. Registered trademarks are protected under the Trademark Law of the PRC and related rules and regulations. Trademarks are registered with the Trademark Office of the SAIC. Where registration is sought for a trademark that is identical or similar to another trademark which has already been registered or given preliminary examination and approval for use in the same or similar category of commodities or services, the application for registration of such trademark may be rejected. Trademark registrations are effective for a renewable ten-year period, unless otherwise revoked. The duration of a trademark is 10 years from the date of registration.



Domain names. Domain name registrations are handled through domain name service agencies established under the relevant regulations, and applicants become domain name holders upon successful registration.

Regulations on Tax



PRC Corporate Income Tax



The PRC corporate income tax, or CIT, is calculated based on the taxable income determined under the applicable CIT Law and its implementation rules, which became effective on January 1, 2008 and amended on February 24, 2017. The CIT Law imposes a uniform corporate income tax rate of 25% on all resident enterprises in China, including foreign-invested enterprises.



Uncertainties exist with respect to how the CIT Law applies to the tax residence status of The Company and our offshore subsidiaries. Under the CIT Law, an enterprise established outside of China with a “de facto management body” within China is considered a “resident enterprise,” which means that it is treated in a manner similar to a Chinese enterprise for corporate income tax purposes. Although the implementation rules of the CIT Law define “de facto management body” as a managing body that exercises substantive and overall management and control over the production and business, personnel, accounting books and assets of an enterprise, the only official guidance for this definition currently available is set forth in Circular 82 issued by the State Administration of Taxation, which provides guidance on the determination of the tax residence status of a Chinese-controlled offshore incorporated enterprise, defined as an enterprise that is incorporated under the laws of a foreign country or territory and that has a PRC enterprise or enterprise group as its primary controlling shareholder. Although the Company does not have a PRC enterprise or enterprise group as our primary controlling shareholder and is therefore not a Chinese-controlled offshore incorporated enterprise within the meaning of Circular 82, in the absence of guidance specifically applicable to us, we have applied the guidance set forth in Circular 82 to evaluate the tax residence status of The Company and our subsidiaries organized outside the PRC.



According to Circular 82, a Chinese-controlled offshore incorporated enterprise will be regarded as a PRC tax resident by virtue of having a “de facto management body” in China and will be subject to PRC corporate income tax on its worldwide income only if all of the following criteria are met:




● | the primary location of the day-to-day operational management is in the PRC;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | decisions relating to the enterprise’s financial and human resource matters are made or are subject to approval by organizations or personnel in the PRC;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the enterprise’s primary assets, accounting books and records, company seals, and board and shareholders meeting minutes are located or maintained in the PRC; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 50% or more of voting board members or senior executives habitually reside in the PRC.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We do not believe that we meet any of the conditions outlined in the immediately preceding paragraph.



We believe none of our entities outside of China is a PRC resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes. However, the tax resident status of an enterprise is subject to determination by the PRC tax authorities and uncertainties remain with respect to the interpretation of the term “de facto management body.” As all of our management members are based in China, it remains unclear how the tax residency rule will apply to our case. If the PRC tax authorities determine that we or any of our subsidiaries outside of China is a PRC resident enterprise for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, then we or such subsidiary could be subject to PRC tax at a rate of 25% on its world-wide income, which could materially reduce our net income. In addition, we will also be subject to PRC enterprise income tax reporting obligations. Furthermore, if the PRC tax authorities determine that we are a PRC resident enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes, gains realized on the sale or other disposition of our common stock may be subject to PRC tax, at a rate of 10% in the case of non-PRC enterprises or 20% in the case of non-PRC individuals (in each case, subject to the provisions of any applicable tax treaty), if such gains are deemed to be from PRC sources. It is unclear whether non-PRC shareholders of our company would be able to claim the benefits of any tax treaties between their country of tax residence and the PRC in the event that we are treated as a PRC resident enterprise. Any such tax may reduce the returns on your investment in our common stock.



Value-Added Tax and Business Tax



In November 2011, the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation promulgated the Pilot Plan for Imposition of Value-Added Tax to Replace Business Tax. In May and December 2013 and April 2014, the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation promulgated Circular 37, Circular 106 and Circular 43 to further expand the scope of services which are to be subject to Value-Added Tax, or VAT, instead of business tax. Pursuant to these tax rules, from August 1, 2013, VAT will be imposed to replace the business tax in certain service industries, including technology services and advertising services, on a nationwide basis. The VAT rate shall be 17% for sale or importation of goods by a taxpayer. But, unlike business tax, a taxpayer is allowed to offset the qualified input VAT paid on taxable purchases against the output VAT chargeable on the revenue from services provided.

Regulations Relating to Foreign Exchange and Dividend Distribution



Foreign Exchange Regulation



The principal regulations governing foreign currency exchange in China are the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations. Under the PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, such as profit distributions and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, may be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. By contrast, approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is required where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of foreign currency-denominated loans or foreign currency is to be remitted into China under the capital account, such as a capital increase or foreign currency loans to our PRC subsidiaries.



In November 2012, SAFE promulgated the Circular of Further Improving and Adjusting Foreign Exchange Administration Policies on Foreign Direct Investment. Pursuant to this circular, the opening of various special purpose foreign exchange accounts, such as pre-establishment expenses accounts, foreign exchange capital accounts and guarantee accounts, the reinvestment of RMB proceeds by foreign investors in the PRC, and remittance of foreign exchange profits and dividends by a foreign-invested enterprise to its foreign shareholders no longer require the approval or verification of SAFE, and multiple capital accounts for the same entity may be opened in different provinces, which was not possible previously. In addition, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Printing and Distributing the Provisions on Foreign Exchange Administration over Domestic Direct Investment by Foreign Investors and the Supporting Documents in May 2013, which specifies that the administration by SAFE or its local branches over direct investment by foreign investors in the PRC shall be conducted by way of registration and banks shall process foreign exchange business relating to the direct investment in the PRC based on the registration information provided by SAFE and its branches.



We typically do not need to use our offshore foreign currency to fund our PRC operations. In the event we need to do so, we will apply to obtain the relevant approvals of SAFE and other PRC government authorities as necessary.



SAFE Circular 37



SAFE promulgated the Circular on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents’ Offshore Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular 37, on July 4, 2014, which replaced the former circular commonly known as “SAFE Circular 75” promulgated by SAFE on October 21, 2005. SAFE Circular 37 requires PRC residents to register with local branches of SAFE in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity, for the purpose of overseas investment and financing, with such PRC residents’ legally owned assets or equity interests in domestic enterprises or offshore assets or interests, referred to in SAFE Circular 37 as a “special purpose vehicle.” SAFE Circular 37 further requires amendment to the registration in the event of any significant changes with respect to the special purpose vehicle, such as increase or decrease of capital contributed by PRC individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division or other material event. In the event that a PRC shareholder holding interests in a special purpose vehicle fails to fulfill the required SAFE registration, the PRC subsidiaries of that special purpose vehicle may be prohibited from making profit distributions to the offshore parent and from carrying out subsequent cross-border foreign exchange activities, and the special purpose vehicle may be restricted in its ability to contribute additional capital into its PRC subsidiary. Furthermore, failure to comply with the various SAFE registration requirements described above could result in liability under PRC law for evasion of foreign exchange controls.



We have notified substantial beneficial owners of common stock who we know are PRC residents of their filing obligation. However, we may not be aware of the identities of all our beneficial owners who are PRC residents. In addition, we do not have control over our beneficial owners and cannot assure you that all of our PRC resident beneficial owners will comply with SAFE Circular 37. The failure of our beneficial owners who are PRC residents to register or amend their SAFE registrations in a timely manner pursuant to SAFE Circular 37 or the failure of future beneficial owners of our company who are PRC residents to comply with the registration procedures set forth in SAFE Circular 37 may subject such beneficial owners or our PRC subsidiaries to fines and legal sanctions. Failure to register or amend the registration may also limit our ability to contribute additional capital to our PRC subsidiaries or receive dividends or other distributions from our PRC subsidiaries or other proceeds from disposal of our PRC subsidiaries, or we may be penalized by SAFE.



Share Option Rules



Under the Administration Measures on Individual Foreign Exchange Control issued by the PBOC on December 25, 2006, all foreign exchange matters involved in employee share ownership plans and share option plans in which PRC citizens participate require approval from SAFE or its authorized branch. Pursuant to SAFE Circular 37, PRC residents who participate in share incentive plans in overseas non-publicly-listed companies may submit applications to SAFE or its local branches for the foreign exchange registration with respect to offshore special purpose companies.
