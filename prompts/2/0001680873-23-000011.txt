ITEM 1.    BUSINESS.
Overview
HF Foods Group Inc., operating through our subsidiaries (“HF Group,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), is a leading foodservice distributor to Asian restaurants, primarily Chinese restaurants located throughout the United States. HF Group was formed through a merger between two complementary market leaders, HF Group and B&R Global Holdings, Inc. ("B&R Global"), on November 4, 2019.
With 18 distribution centers and a fleet of over 400 refrigerated vehicles, our distribution network now spans 46 states covering approximately 95% of the contiguous United States. Capitalizing on our deep understanding of the Chinese culture, with over 1,000 employees and subcontractors, and supported by two outsourced call centers in China, we have become a trusted partner serving over 15,000 Asian restaurants providing sales and service support to customers who mainly converse in Mandarin or Chinese dialects. 
We are committed to providing excellent customer service by delivering a distinctive product portfolio built from an indelible partnership with both foreign and domestic suppliers. These relationships ensure that we deliver an outstanding array of products at competitive prices. Our relationships with suppliers and knowledge of the market are the cornerstones of our negotiating power with suppliers and enable us to better manage potential supply chain disruptions and stockouts, gain price concessions and increase delivery schedules. 
Corporate History
HF Group was originally incorporated in the State of Delaware on May 19, 2016 as a special purpose acquisition company under the name Atlantic Acquisition Corp. (“Atlantic”), in order to acquire, through a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination with, one or more businesses or entities.
On August 22, 2018, Atlantic consummated a reverse acquisition transaction resulting in the shareholders of HF Group Holding Corporation (“HF Holding”) becoming the majority shareholders of Atlantic, and changed its name to HF Foods Group Inc. On November 4, 2019, we consummated a merger transaction, resulting in B&R Global becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of HF Group. 
On January 17, 2020, we acquired 100% equity membership interest in nine subsidiaries under B&R Group Realty Holding, LLC ("BRGR"), which owned warehouse facilities that were being leased to B&R Global for its operations in California, Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Washington, and Montana. 
On December 30, 2021, HF Group acquired substantially all of the assets of leading seafood suppliers Great Wall Seafood Supply, Inc., a Texas corporation, Great Wall Restaurant Supplier, Inc., an Ohio corporation, and First Mart Inc., an Illinois corporation (collectively the "Great Wall Group"). 
On April 29, 2022, HF Group acquired substantially all of the assets of Sealand Food, Inc., one of the largest frozen seafood suppliers servicing the Asian/Chinese restaurant market along the eastern seaboard, from Massachusetts to Florida, as well as Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee.
Our Business and Products
Our business features 18 strategically positioned distribution centers with over one million square feet of warehouse space and a fleet of over 400 vehicles to provide a wide variety of products with a strong focus on Asian specialty food ingredients essential for Asian cooking. Supported by an extensive supplier network, we aim to provide a one-stop service with on-time delivery and high fulfillment rates, at competitive pricing.
We offer over 2,000 different products to our clients, which include virtually all items needed to operate their restaurant business. Product offerings range from meat and poultry, perishable fresh produce, frozen seafood, general commodities and takeout food packaging materials to meet our customers’ demands. The majority of our procurement currently consists of goods purchased domestically and imported goods purchased through domestic brokers, such as frozen meat, seafood and fresh vegetables, which are procured through large suppliers or directly from producers. 
The following table sets forth our broad range of products and sales percentage by category for the year ended December 31, 2022:

Category | Description | Percentage
Seafood | Lobster, shrimp, crab, scallops and fish, such as tuna and Alaskan salmon | 30% 
Asian Specialty | Products with an Asian flair or flavor, including specialty noodles, rice, dry goods, such as dried mushrooms or dried beans, specialty sauces/seasonings, spring rolls, and canned products, such as preserved vegetables, bamboo shoots and water chestnuts | 26% 
Meat and Poultry | Beef, pork, chicken and duck | 20% 
Fresh Produce | Fresh, seasonal fruits and vegetables, such as celery, Chinese cabbage and winter melon which are widely used in Chinese cuisines | 11% 
Packaging and Other | Take-out accessories for customers, from bamboo chopsticks to takeout containers, plastic cups and sushi combo boxes | 7% 
Commodity | General commodities including oil, flour, salt and sugar | 6% 

We have an extensive supplier network and established long-term relationships with our major suppliers. Our long-term relationships and vast distribution network enable our increased negotiating power given the large quantities, thereby improving our inventory turnover and accounts payable, and reducing our operating costs. Instead of going to fragmented direct store distributors to source their products, customers are consolidating their vendors into our full service, one-stop-shop for most of their purchasing needs. 
This initiative is made possible from order placement to delivery due to our warehouse operations, optimized fleet management, material handling equipment and techniques, and efficient administrative and operating staffs. This is further complemented by our two outsourced sales call centers located in China which take customers' inbound calls during non-office hours in the U.S. (inbound calls in the U.S. are redirected to China) for order taking, customer relationship management and after-sales service, offering customers a warm and friendly human interaction channel who speaks and understands their language and needs. 
We have an extensive reach to our customers through localized, high frequency deliveries which allows them to reduce their inventory through higher inventory turnover and just-in-time inventory, and to reduce waste, especially in fresh products. Our temperature-controlled trucks deliver both short and medium distance routes daily to ensure on-time delivery and to achieve high fill rates to our customers. 
Our Strategy
We are differentiated from mainstream food distribution companies, such as Sysco Corporation ("Sysco"), US Foods Holding Corp. ("US Foods") and Performance Food Group Company ("PFGC"), through our strong understanding of Asian culture and cooking essentials, distinctive product portfolio and resourceful supply chains. We believe our wide range of Asian-centric product offerings is unmatched, as many of the items we offer are unique and specific to the Chinese restaurant industry.
We believe that our scale and deep knowledge of our customers’ needs provide a competitive advantage over our direct competitors and have contributed greatly to our success, including the following:
•Wide array of Asian specialty products: These are not commonly provided by large distributors serving the mainstream market.
•Deep understanding of Chinese culture: As our customers are primarily Chinese and Asian restaurants, most of our employees can speak Mandarin as well as the native dialects of our customers. We believe this is a key business strength and competitive advantage, as many of the restaurants' owners/chefs are migrants who feel less comfortable conversing in English. 
•Lower sales and administrative expenses: We outsource our telephone-based sales and customer service to two call centers located in China with Mandarin and Chinese dialect (Fuzhounese) speaking agents to better serve our customers.
•Purchasing power: We capitalize on economies of scale and have strong relationships with both our domestic and foreign suppliers.
•Warehouse location: We have strategically located distribution centers and cross-docks, supported by our fleet of delivery vehicles with most routes limited to 3 to 5 hours driving time, ensuring on-time delivery and order fill-rate.
•Technology: With our customized inventory management system, we are able to manage our customer relationships and inventory efficiently and reduce operating expenses.
•Customer-specific marketing: Our employees’ bilingual capabilities provide a competitive advantage against other major providers in the industry.
We aim to further expand into new key markets, as well as to strategically consolidate our market leadership position in existing markets, primarily through acquisitions. We will also explore potential vertical expansion in our acquisition strategy, both upstream and downstream of the foodservice value chain, including providing value-added items such as semi-prepared food products to help our customers upgrade their service, as well as exploring adjacent markets. We continue to invest in technological advancements to develop state-of-the-art management information and operating systems, to further improve our operational efficiency, accuracy and customer satisfaction, and to cement our foothold as a leading foodservice distributor to Asian restaurants in the U.S.
Features of Chinese Restaurants
Set forth below are the principal characteristics of the Asian/Chinese restaurants we serve.
Primarily Serving Non-Chinese Americans. There are tens of thousands of Chinese restaurants spread throughout the U.S., primarily serving non-Chinese American customers. Although the dishes they serve cater to the preferences of American mainstream customers and are more simply and quickly prepared as compared to traditional full-service Chinese restaurant cuisine, they still require specialized and distinctive Chinese ingredients used in traditional Chinese cooking styles.
Operated by Chinese Individual Families. Most Chinese restaurants serviced by HF Group are generally family-owned with very few workers, who are usually immigrants from China or second generation Chinese Americans. These restaurant owners, especially the founders, are generally less sophisticated, with limited education and resources and appreciate value-added services from suppliers to help them improve their operational efficiency. The owners and workers in these Chinese restaurants usually speak Mandarin or other regional dialects of the Chinese language. We believe that understanding their culture and language is paramount to facilitating efficient communications and building trust with customers.
Close-Knit Chinese American Community. Second or third generation Chinese Americans living in the U.S. inherit their traditional cultural values, and ethnic languages, and our experience has been that people in these communities prefer to do business with Chinese Americans that speak their language and share their values.
Unique Cooking Style and Ingredients for Chinese Cuisines. Chinese cuisine requires unique cooking techniques such as steaming and stir-frying in a Chinese wok, and requires specialty ingredients and vegetables such as bitter melons, Chinese yams, vine spinach, Chinese cabbage and winter melon. It also requires Chinese and Asian seasonings and spices, including peanut oil, Chinese cooking wine, vinegar, dark soy source, black bean sauce, pepper oil and chili oil. Most of the unique ingredients for Chinese cuisine are staple supplies of HF Group that are not widely available from mainstream U.S. suppliers.
Current Industry Landscape and Opportunities
Growing Demand in Asian Cuisines. The demand for Chinese and Asian cuisines continues to grow in the U.S. In addition, according to the Pew Research Center, the Asian population in the U.S. is the fastest growing population group in the country. We believe that these powerful trends will continue and result in expanded opportunities for Asian/Chinese restaurants. As a leading foodservice distributor to Asian/Chinese restaurants in the U.S., these trends represent a significant growth opportunity for HF Group. 
Cultural Barriers to Entry. Understanding Chinese cooking culture is important to running a Chinese restaurant, and, therefore, most Chinese restaurants are operated by Chinese Americans. We believe that it is very difficult for mainstream food distributors to serve these restaurants due to various cultural and language barriers.
Highly Fragmented Market. The Asian foodservice market is currently highly fragmented with many small and unsophisticated direct store distributors, such as small-scale wholesaler redistributors, specialty import brokers, farmers markets, and local produce retailers, operating without significant financial support or a sophisticated logistics infrastructure. We believe we are the leading Chinese food distributor in the U.S. with a well-developed logistics infrastructure, strong financial means, and experienced management team that provides the marketplace with an avenue for consolidated purchasing, high fill rate, and efficient delivery frequency at a competitive price. The fragmented nature of the Asian foodservice market creates acquisition opportunities for our company to continue to expand its geographic footprint and customer base.
Competitive Advantages over New Entrants. Each distribution center requires a large amount of invested capital to support the full temperature-controlled logistics and warehouse operations to help customers grow their sales and profit. Consolidated purchasing allows us to pass on cost savings to our customers and provide competitive pricing. We believe our continued investment in technology will lead to long-term expense reduction and further administrative efficiency. These competitive advantages result in economies of scale which smaller and fragmented suppliers cannot match.
Demand for Value-Added Services. Our customers are Asian/Chinese restaurants, primarily takeout restaurants. These customers are price and quality sensitive with a high demand for great service and mutual trust. Our employees speak their language, understand their culture and build a bond with our customers. Our 24-hour after sale service call domestically and in China allows us to serve as a supportive and dependable business partner. Through vendor partnerships, we help our large customers source distinct products from their choice of vendors, either domestically or internationally. These are the value added services that we are able to provide to our customers in our one-stop shopping offering.
Continued Consumer Spending on Food Away From Home. Prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture ("USDA"), the food away from home market grew to surpass spending on the food at home market. The foodservice industry declined sharply when COVID-19 restrictions adversely impacted restaurants' operations and foot traffic. As COVID-19 restrictions eased in 2021 and into 2022, both full service and fast food/take out restaurants have rebounded. We believe the long-term trend of increasing food away from home market consumption will resume and continue to be a key driver of demand for Asian/Chinese restaurants. 
Customer Service
We employ a two-pronged approach for a complete and cohesive support to both existing and prospective customers; namely, the two outsourced call centers located in Fuzhou, China, and the domestic sales team in the U.S. Utilizing these outsourced call centers in China, customers embrace and appreciate our personal customer service conducted in their native Mandarin and other regional dialects such as Fuzhounese and Cantonese.
Full sales support from the beginning of a sales order to post-sales service is offered through these call centers. These services are complemented by our domestic sales teams who make regular on-site visits to customers’ restaurants. With cultural understanding coupled with a distinct and diverse cultural bonding, the entire sales team has been successful in forging better customer rapport and retention and is better able to understand customers’ needs and operations as compared to the mainstream foodservice distributors attempting to serve this channel. Utilizing our customized information system to share valuable and pertinent information with our customers is important to help them grow their business. This information includes, but is not limited to, purchasing history, order tracking, item availability, items on promotion, and best-selling or trending items. 
We formulate strategies and implement action plans to ensure cohesive sales and marketing efforts to our existing and prospective customers. The domestic sales team works closely with the sales staff in China to ensure our strategies are implemented effectively and our action plans are carried out swiftly. Distribution centers are decentralized and empowered to cater to local and regional customers’ needs by customizing their specific product portfolio. With respect to customer care and satisfaction, we offer a refund policy without penalty, which many of our small competitors in the market segment and the direct store distributors are unable to provide. Our 100% satisfaction guarantee permits our customers to reject part of the order or the entire order within 24 hours of receipt without any penalty. We believe that this refund policy further cements the trust and loyalty of our customers toward our brand and company. 
Suppliers
We consolidate procurement on bulk and frequently sold items. Our distribution centers send their inventory procurement requests to regional buyers who are responsible for consolidation and fulfillment in the most cost-effective way. The consolidated procurement process allows HF Group to establish a meaningful vendor relationship under one brand.
We maintain a large supplier network through a vendor pool with a carefully selected group of suppliers to ensure product quality, availability and competitive pricing. To minimize costs, the procurement team directly manages our major vendors for large and frequent purchases and engages brokers for our smaller suppliers of specialty goods. Utilizing brokers allows us to maintain lower costs due to the brokers’ volume.
The key procurement team members closely monitor the supply market for seasonal products, such as vegetables, and makes procurement adjustments according to market conditions. In addition, they use a dual-sourcing method for their suppliers and can negotiate lower prices for comparable products.
Each distribution center reviews the inventory level in the information system daily and submits purchase requests as needed to the procurement team at headquarters and regional offices. The procurement teams at headquarters and our regional offices can alter or adjust purchasing decisions based on an analysis of the inventory data in the system. Upon receipt of ordered products, the delivery schedule is determined based on the needs of each location. The lead-time for products is dependent on the product category and need. For perishable goods, products are usually delivered by suppliers within 72 hours of placing the order. Products that are ordered through import brokers have lead times of up to seven days.
None of our suppliers accounted for more than 10% of our aggregate purchases during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Trademarks
Except for the trademarks for HF black and white/color logos, Rong, Rong GREEN LEAF, Great Wall logos, <333>, SEA333, and SEA888, we do not own or have the right to use any patent, trademark, trade name, license, franchise or concession, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Human Capital
One of our primary areas of focus is to continue to strengthen our team by retaining, attracting, and hiring qualified top talent. This includes implementing the right organizational structure with a focus on growing capabilities through training and development of our talent.
We believe one of the key factors of our success is the commitment and loyalty of our workforce. All of our general managers and distribution level management team have been with the business since our inception. Their deep understanding of the business and the strong relationships they maintain with front line employees enable us to be a union free workforce.
As of December 31, 2022, we have 1,070 total employees, which includes 890 permanent employees and 180 temporary employees through agencies.
Compensation and Benefits
We are committed to positively impacting the lives of our employees by offering competitive pay and affordable benefits. In 2022, we made the decision to completely revamp our compensation and benefits programs. We rolled out a comprehensive management incentive bonus and long-term incentive equity plan to include a broader group of non-executive employees. We also adopted plans to enhance our benefit plan designs with lower employee premiums and offer more free benefits to our employees with an effective date in 2023.
Recruiting, Training, and Development
Our ability to continue to retain, attract, and recruit top talent at all levels is key to our future success. In 2022, we launched an Operations Leadership Development Program aimed to develop the next generation of general manager leaders. As we continue to transform our operations through new system and process improvements, training and development of our existing employees is vital.
Diversity and Inclusion
HF Foods was founded by Asian Americans. Building a successful business based on diversity and inclusion has been part of our DNA since our inception. Throughout our history, we have continued to maintain diversity and inclusion as one of our top priorities. 99% of our total workforce is made up of Hispanic, Black or African American, and Asian employees.
In recent years, we have strengthened our commitment to diversity and inclusion. Three out of five members of our Board of Directors are Asian and two out of five are women. At the corporate level, nearly 47% of our director and above positions are held by women.
Government Regulation
Legal compliance is important to our operations. We are required to comply, and it is our policy to comply, with all applicable laws in the numerous jurisdictions in which we do business.
As a marketer and distributor of food products in the U.S., we are subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA"). The FDA regulates food safety and quality through various statutory and regulatory mandates, including manufacturing and holding requirements for foods through good manufacturing practice regulations, hazard analysis and critical control point requirements for certain foods, and the food and color additive approval process. The agency also specifies the standards of identity for certain foods, prescribes the format and content of information required to appear on food product labels, regulates food contact packaging and materials, and maintains a Reportable Food Registry for the industry to report when there is a reasonable probability that an article of food will cause serious adverse health consequences. For certain product lines, we are also subject to the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, the Packers and Stockyard Act and regulations promulgated by the USDA to interpret and implement these statutory provisions. The USDA imposes standards for product safety, quality and sanitation through the federal meat and poultry inspection program. The USDA reviews and approves the labeling of these products and also establishes standards for the grading and commercial acceptance of produce shipments from our suppliers. We are also subject to the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, which imposes certain registration and record keeping requirements on facilities that manufacture, process, pack or hold food for human or animal consumption.
The recently published and pending rules under the Food Safety Modernization Act ("FSMA") will significantly expand food safety requirements, including those of HF Group. Among other things, FDA regulations implementing the FSMA require us to establish and maintain comprehensive, prevention-based controls across the food supply chain that are both verified and validated. The FSMA also imposes new requirements for food products imported into the U.S. and provides the FDA with mandatory recall authority.
HF Group and our products are also subject to state and local regulation through such measures as the licensing of our facilities; enforcement by state and local health agencies of state and local standards for our products; and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of our products. Our facilities are subject to regulations issued pursuant to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act by the U.S. Department of Labor. These regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing, health and safety standards to protect employees from accidents and to establish hazard communication programs to transmit information on the hazards of certain chemicals which may be present in products that we distribute.
Our distribution facilities must be registered with the FDA biennially and are subject to periodic government agency inspections by the FDA and USDA. Our facilities are generally inspected at least annually by federal and/or state authorities. Further, we are required to establish communication programs to transmit information about the hazards of certain chemicals present in some of the products we distribute.
Our business and employment practices are also subject to regulation by numerous federal, state and local regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Department of Labor, which sets employment practice standards for workers, and the U.S. Department of Transportation, as well as its agencies, the Surface Transportation Board, the Federal Highway Administration, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which collectively regulate our trucking business through the regulation of operations, safety, insurance and hazardous materials. We must comply with the safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hours-of service. Such matters as weight and dimension of equipment also fall under federal and state regulations. We also are subject to federal and state immigration laws, regulations and programs that regulate our ability to hire or retain foreign employees. In addition, we are subject to the U.S. False Claims Act, and similar state statutes, which prohibit the submission of claims for payment to the government that are false and the knowing retention of overpayments.
Our operations are also subject to a broad range of U.S. federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, as well as zoning and building regulations. Environmental laws and regulations cover a variety of procedures, including appropriately managing wastewater and stormwater; complying with clean air laws, including those governing vehicle emissions; proper handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes; protecting against and appropriately investigating and remediating spills and releases; and monitoring and maintaining underground and above ground storage tanks for diesel fuel and other petroleum products. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the costs of managing our compliance with environmental laws and regulations was nominal.
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") prohibits bribery of public officials to obtain or retain business in foreign jurisdictions. The FCPA also requires us to keep accurate books and records and to maintain internal accounting controls to detect and prevent bribery and to ensure that transactions are properly authorized. We have implemented appropriate policy and will continue to maintain a robust anti-corruption compliance program applicable to our operations.
For the purchase of items produced, harvested or manufactured outside of the U.S., we are subject to applicable customs laws regarding the import and export of various products. Certain activities, including working with customs brokers and freight forwarders, are subject to applicable regulation by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which is a part of the Department of Homeland Security.
