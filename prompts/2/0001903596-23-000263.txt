Item 1. Business.
Company History
 Ethema Health Corporation (the “Company” or “Ethema”), a Colorado corporation was incorporated under the laws of the State of Colorado on April 1, 1993, and is the surviving company of a merger, effective February 1, 1995, between the Company and Nova Natural Resources Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“Nova Delaware”). The merger was effectuated solely for the purpose of changing the Company’s domicile from Delaware to Colorado. At all times prior to 2001, the Company was engaged in the oil and gas exploration business. Nova Delaware was the successor entity to Nova Petroleum Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and Power Resources Corporation, a Delaware corporation, which merged in 1986 (“the 1986 Merger”). Prior to the 1986 Merger, Nova Petroleum Corporation and Power Resources Corporation had operated since 1979 and 1972, respectively. In 2001, the Company entered into the electronics business and this business was active in 2001 and 2002, as part of the Torita Group. After 2002, the Company continued with various stages of development in this business until 2010.
 
On April 1, 2010, the Company changed its principal operations from development stage electronics to healthcare services. On March 29, 2010, the Company entered into a one year consulting agreement with GreeneStone Clinic Inc., a Canadian corporation (“Greenestone Clinic”), whereby Greenestone Clinic provided consulting services for the Company’s development and operation of medical clinics in the province of Ontario, Canada. Specifically, Greenestone Clinic provided medical and business expertise in the initial startup of private clinics and technical assistance to ensure that the clinics were in compliance with governmental policy and procedure requirements as well as any operational requirements. At the time of entering into this consulting agreement, Greenestone Clinic operated a clinic at the Muskoka property housing its addiction treatment clinic and provided endoscopy services. The Company started offering medical services in June 2010, offering various medical services, including endoscopy, cardiology and executive medicals, which services were subsequently sold.
 
On May 15, 2010, the Company secured a sublease of space (which was previously the Rothbart Pain Clinic) of approximately 8,000 sq. ft. to be used as the Company’s executive offices and to run an endoscopy clinic. The Endoscopy clinic was subsequently sold. The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary GreeneStone Clinic Muskoka Inc. (“GreeneStone Muskoka”), also entered into a lease with the owner of the Muskoka premises on April 1, 2011 and provided mental health and addiction treatment services and operated an in-patient addiction treatment center at this location.
 
During December 2016, the Company obtained a license to operate and provide addiction treatment healthcare services in Florida, USA. The company commenced operations under this license with effect from January 2017.
 
On February 14, 2017, the Company completed a series of transactions (referred to collectively as the “Restructuring Transactions”), including a Share Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) whereby the Company acquired 100% of the stock of Cranberry Cove Holdings Ltd. (“CCH”), which held the real estate on which the Company’s GreeneStone Muskoka operated, an asset purchase agreement (the “APA”) and lease (the “Lease”) whereby the Company sold certain of the GreeneStone Muskoka business assets and leased the real estate to the buyer, and a real estate purchase agreement and asset purchase agreement whereby the Company purchased the real estate and business assets of Seastone Delray (the “Florida Purchase”).

The Share Purchase Agreement
 Under the SPA, the Company acquired 100% of the stock of CCH from Leon Developments Ltd. (“Leon Developments”), a company wholly owned by Shawn E. Leon, who is the President, CEO, and CFO of the Company (“Mr. Leon”). CCH owns the real estate on which GreeneStone Muskoka is located. The total consideration paid by the Company was CDN$3,517,062, including the assumption of certain liabilities of CCH, which was funded by the assignment to Leon Developments of certain indebtedness owing to the Company in the amount of CDN$659,918, and the issuance of 60,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to Leon Developments, valued at US$0.0364 per share.
The Asset Purchase Agreement and Lease
 Under the APA, the assets of GreeneStone Muskoka were sold by the Company, through its subsidiary, GreeneStone Muskoka, to Canadian Addiction Residential Treatment LP (the “Purchaser” or “CART”), for a total consideration of CDN$10,000,000. The proceeds of the GreeneStone Muskoka asset sale were used to pay down certain tax debts and operational costs of the Company and to fund the Florida Purchase, mentioned below.
 
Through the APA, substantially all of the assets of GreeneStone Muskoka were sold, leaving Ethema with only the underlying clinic real estate, which the Company, through its newly acquired subsidiary, CCH concurrently leased to the Purchaser. The Lease is a triple net lease and provides for a five (5) year primary term with three (3) five-year renewal options, annual base rent for the first year at CDN$420,000 with annual increases, an option to tenant to purchase the leased premises and certain first refusal rights.
 
The Florida Purchases and Business
 Immediately after closing on the sale of the assets of GreeneStone Muskoka, the Company closed on the acquisition of the business and real estate assets of Seastone Delray pursuant to certain real estate and asset purchase agreements. This business is operated through its wholly owned subsidiary, Addiction Recovery Institute of America, LLC (“ARIA”). The purchase price for the ARIA assets was US$6,070,000 financed with a purchase money mortgage of US$3,000,000, and US$3,070,000 in cash.
On April 4, 2017 the Company changed its Corporate name from Greenestone Healthcare Corporation to Ethema Health Corporation.
 
On November 2, 2017, the Company entered into an Agreement to purchase from AREP 5400 East Avenue LLC (“the Landlord”) certain buildings in West Palm Beach, Florida, totaling approximately 80,000 square feet, on which the Company planned to operate a substance abuse treatment center. The purchase price of the Property was $20,530,000. The Company made a series of nonrefundable down payments totaling $2,940,546 in 2017 and 2018. The Company could not get the necessary financing to close on the deal.
 
On May 23, 2018, the Company converted the agreement to purchase the buildings from the Landlord into a real property lease agreement with a purchase option. The lease was for an initial 10 years and provided for two additional 10 year extensions.
 
In June 2018, the Company moved its ARIA operations into the West Palm Beach properties and in September 2018 received a license to operate in-patient detoxification and residential treatment services.
 
In June of 2019, the Company and the Landlord wished to proceed with marketing the property for sale and agreed to convert the long term lease into a month to month lease for a reduced amount of space.
 
The Company once again had an opportunity to purchase the property in October of 2019 but could not arrange for sufficient financing to complete the purchase and the Landlord subsequently entered into a conditional agreement with another purchaser and on December 20, 2019, the Company entered into an agreement with the landlord to terminate the lease agreement on January 31, 2020.
 
On June 30, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement (“the Stock Purchase Agreement”), whereby the Company agreed to acquire 51% of American Treatment Holdings, Inc. (“ATHI”) from The Q Global Trust (“Seller”) and Lawrence B Hawkins (“Hawkins”), which owned 100% of Evernia Health Services LLC. (“Evernia”), which operates drug rehabilitation facilities. The consideration for the acquisition was a loan to be provided by the Company to Evernia in the amount of $500,000.

The Company originally had a 180 day option, to purchase an additional 9% of ETHI for a purchase consideration of $50,000. On April 28, 2021, the Stock Purchase Agreement was amended whereby the option to purchase an additional 9% of ATHI for $50,000 was amended to purchase an additional 24%, an increase of 15% over the prior option, for 100,000,000 shares of common stock and $50,000. The remaining condition to closing, the receipt of approval for the change of ownership of the license from the Department of Children and Family Services of Florida, was satisfied by probationary approval, which was received on June 30, 2021. The Company exercised the option and issued the 100,000,000 shares of common stock, resulting in the Company owning 75% of ATHI.
