ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
General
The company, which was founded in 1963 in Columbus, Ohio, has evolved over time from an apparel-based specialty retailer to a segment leader focused on home fragrance, body care and soaps and sanitizer products operating under the Bath & Body Works, White Barn and other brand names. We strive to make the world a brighter, happier place through the power of fragrance. We care about our customers and believe in giving them a reason to celebrate with fragrance every day. We remain committed to improving our communities and fostering a diverse, equitable and inclusive culture that is focused on delivering exceptional fragrances and experiences. We are home to America’s Favorite Fragrances® and offer a breadth of exclusive fragrances for the body and home, including top-selling collections for fine fragrance mist, body lotion and body cream, 3-wick candles, home fragrance diffusers and liquid hand soap. For more than 30 years, customers have looked to Bath & Body Works for quality, on-trend products and the newest, freshest fragrances. We intend to build and transform an already strong foundation into a leading global omnichannel personal care and home fragrance brand.
As of January 28, 2023, our merchandise was sold through 1,802 company-operated stores and e-commerce sites in the United States of America ("U.S.") and Canada, and in 427 stores and 31 e-commerce sites in more than 45 other countries operating under franchise, license and wholesale arrangements. 
On August 2, 2021, the company completed the spin-off of its Victoria's Secret business, which included the Victoria's Secret and PINK brands, into an independent publicly traded company ("Victoria's Secret & Co." and such transaction, the "Separation") on a tax-free basis. Accordingly, the operating results of the Victoria's Secret business are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. All discussion within this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including amounts, percentages and disclosures for all periods presented, reflect only the continuing operations of the company unless otherwise noted. In connection with the spin-off of the Victoria's Secret business, the company changed its name from L Brands, Inc. to Bath & Body Works, Inc. ("we" or the "Company"). Additionally, starting on August 3, 2021, the Company's common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") under the stock symbol "BBWI."
Fiscal Year
Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31. As used herein, “2022,” “2021” and “2020” refer to the 52-week periods ended January 28, 2023, January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021, respectively. 
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe the following competitive strengths contribute to our leading market position, differentiate us from our competitors and will drive future long-term sustainable growth:
Industry Leading Brand and Products
We have developed and operate a well-known, beloved and broadly appealing brand, which allows us to target markets across the economic spectrum, across demographics and across the world. We are an affordable luxury brand with covetable offerings, and a key tenet of our strategy is offering products at all price points. Customers look to us to celebrate the season, transport them to another time and place, decorate their home and find the perfect gift.
We have also developed trusted and market leading products in the body care, home fragrance, and soap and sanitizer categories. Our products are differentiated through a combination of fragrance, packaging and quality at accessible prices. We also sell products under our trusted sub brands, including White Barn and Aromatherapy.
In-Store Experience and Store Operations
We view our customers' in-store experience as an important vehicle for communicating the image of our brand. We utilize visual presentation of merchandise, fragrance, in-store marketing, music and our sales associates to reinforce the image represented by our brand. Our in-store marketing is designed to convey the principal elements and personality of our brand. The store design, visual marketing and storytelling, fixtures, scents, and music are all carefully planned and coordinated to create a unique shopping experience. We display merchandise uniformly to ensure a consistent store experience, regardless of location. Store managers receive detailed plans designating fixture and merchandise placement to ensure coordinated execution of the Company-wide merchandising strategy. Our sales associates and store managers are a central element in bringing our seasonal storytelling to life by providing a high level of customer service.

Digital Experience 
In addition to our in-store experience, we strive to create a customer-centric digital platform that integrates the digital and physical brand experience and enables convenience for the customer when desired. Our digital presence, including social media, our websites and our loyalty application, allows us to get to know our customers better and communicate with them anytime and anywhere. 
Product Development
Quality and innovation are at the core of our sourcing strategy. We seek to drive efficiencies and mitigate risk through our strong technical research and prolific product development. Our merchant, design and sourcing teams have a long history of bringing innovative and covetable products to our customers. Our product offering and assortment strategy are key to elevating our brand, increasing our long-term pricing power and extending our reach. 
We believe a large part of our success comes from our ability to quickly assess and effectively adjust to changing consumer preferences. We leverage our differentiated product development capabilities to frequently deliver compelling new fragrances, packaging and other product launches. We are dedicated to delivering a full product pipeline by launching new fragrances and products every four to six weeks, with new products launching nearly every week. 
Sourcing and Logistics
Our predominantly domestic, vertically integrated supply chain enables us to successfully navigate a dynamic environment and to respond to changing consumer preferences with speed and agility. Our supplier base includes long-standing vendor relationships, and the majority of our products are produced at Beauty Park, a business park that includes several key vendors within close proximity to our Columbus, Ohio distribution centers. These strategic vendor relationships provide deep capabilities across our product categories.
While our Company-owned distribution centers located in central Ohio are core to our operations, we also utilize third-party distribution centers located throughout North America to position inventory geographically closer to our customers. Third party-operated direct channel fulfillment centers and pop-up fulfillment facilities throughout North America are also used to support our peak needs. In addition, in the fall of 2022, we completed construction of our first Company-operated direct channel fulfillment center. Located near Columbus, Ohio, this facility has 1.1 million square feet of space and state-of-the-art fulfillment capabilities to support the future growth in our direct business (also referred to as digital or e-commerce) and enhanced fulfillment capabilities for our business. 
Experienced and Committed Management Team
Our senior management team has significant retail and business experience at Bath & Body Works, Inc. and other companies such as Unilever, Avon Products, The Estée Lauder Companies, Ann Taylor and Loft, Banana Republic, Ross Stores, Abercrombie & Fitch, Madewell, Carter’s, Rosetta Stone and KPMG.
Our Board of Directors (the "Board") appointed Gina R. Boswell as our Chief Executive Officer and as a member of our Board, effective December 1, 2022. Sarah E. Nash, who had served as Executive Chair of the Board since February 2022 and Interim Chief Executive Officer since May 2022, remained Executive Chair through January 28, 2023, at which time she transitioned back to independent Chair of the Board.
Growth Strategies
Expanding our Customer Base and Customer Spend
As a leading fragrance company, we deliver customers their favorite fragrances in multiple forms and categories with industry- leading speed and innovation. We manage every touchpoint throughout the customer journey to deliver a highly differentiated shopping experience. We have a large, loyal customer base that spans income levels, age groups and ethnicities. We believe we have significant opportunity to acquire new customers, increase spend and further diversify our customer base. 
We are continuing to prioritize investment in our customer experience. As part of this investment, we launched our loyalty program nationwide in the U.S. during August 2022. Our enrollment results have exceeded our initial expectations, with more than 33 million members enrolled to date, and more than 80% of these members were active in the last 12 months. We believe we have opportunity to drive more value and attract more customers to the loyalty program by increasing engagement through personalization, fully integrating the program across social, physical and digital interactions, and making future program enhancements like accelerators and flexible rewards. Our loyalty customers typically spend more, have greater retention rates and make more trips than non-loyalty customers. Our loyalty sales represent approximately two thirds of our U.S. sales since launch in August 2022.

We also believe we have an opportunity to leverage data and analytics to build deeper customer connections to deliver more personalized marketing and develop a more targeted promotion strategy. We believe we can grow our customer base, increase engagement and drive incremental visits, all while decreasing our reliance on broad-based promotions, by implementing a more targeted marketing approach rooted in advanced analytics and customer segmentation.
Optimizing our Product Offering
Our product offering and assortment strategy are key to enhancing our brand, increasing our pricing power and extending our reach. We believe that offering our customer favorites in multiple forms is a competitive differentiator that drives our customer loyalty and purchases. Our cross-category assortment is a key reason for our customers to come back and visit our stores. Our products are designed to be used daily and replenished frequently. We believe we have a strong pipeline of products, and we expect to continue to launch new fragrances and products about every four to six weeks. 
Innovation and newness are key drivers of our business, and we believe we have opportunity for growth in our existing categories through new product launches, formula upgrades and packaging refreshes, which we believe drives traffic and repeat customers. We recently launched a new single-wick vessel in candles, which rounds out our candle portfolio and offers a burn time of 30 to 50 hours. We continue to increase our assortment of scent control wallflower heaters that offer our customers choice in how much scent to enjoy in each room of their home. As we look ahead to 2023, we are focused on delivering fresh and compelling new scents and exciting new product expansions to our fragrance portfolio.
In addition, we continue to learn our customers’ preferences in new and adjacent product lines and plan to continue to add more new and innovative products over time as we work to expand our brand’s global reach. We are focused on leveraging our core strengths in fragrance and innovation to extend our product leadership into categories such as Men's and Wellness. Our Men’s business was our fastest growing product category in 2022 as we test new forms and merchandising ideas. We are also expanding our Wellness collection that is geared towards elevating our customer’s daily wellness routine with curated collections for body and home.
We are also focused on enhancing our brand by developing products with customers' ingredient preferences in mind and on re-thinking our packaging. By the end of 2023, we anticipate that more than half of our products will be formulated without parabens, sulfates and dyes. We are testing recyclable aluminum soap vessels and have introduced the use of post-consumer recycled content in packaging across several of our product categories. Later in 2023, we will be offering hand soap in large cartons that enable our customers to refill their soap containers. By the end of 2025, we plan to increase the amount of post-consumer recycled content to 33% of our total plastic packaging portfolio.
Expanding our International Business
We have an opportunity to drive growth in our international business, which on a reported basis was approximately 4% of our Net Sales in 2022, leveraging our partnership-based, asset-light model. In 2023, we expect our international business to continue to accelerate and continue to have Net Sales growth and accretive operating margins. We believe we have scaling opportunities in existing markets and opportunities to enter into new markets to drive the growth of our international business. We believe our fragrance portfolio allows successful olfactive distortions to local preferences. 
Our franchise partners are committed to greater expansion and opened 89 net new stores in 2022, bringing the total to 427 in over 45 countries (excluding our Company-operated stores in Canada) as of January 28, 2023. Our partners plan to open between 50 and 80 net new international stores in 2023. Additionally, we expect to continue growing the digital components of our international business, including through country-specific web platforms tailored to local languages and preferences and through additional regional expansion. As of January 28, 2023, our partners operated 31 international e-commerce sites, an increase of four from January 29, 2022.
Advancing our Omnichannel Capabilities
We see a significant opportunity to better connect our stores and e-commerce platforms to deliver a seamless experience and increase our customer lifetime value. We are focused on omnichannel initiatives and enhanced capabilities to engage our customers how, when and where they want. During 2022, we rolled out buy online-pickup in store ("BOPIS") to over 800 Company-operated stores and have BOPIS capabilities in more than 1,300 stores as of January 28, 2023. In addition, in the fall of 2022, we completed construction of, and commenced initial operations in, our first Company-operated direct channel fulfillment center with 1.1 million square feet of space and state-of-the-art fulfillment capabilities. 
We seek to continuously improve the online experience for our direct channel by enhancing graphics, video and the marketing/content mix, as well as making our websites and loyalty application easier to navigate. We believe our increased focus on mobile and application interactions will continue to provide flexibility and convenience to our customers, while creating a seamless shopping experience. Our shopping and services initiatives will continue to modernize the customer’s digital shopping experience through features like enhancing the loyalty program and a shoppable mobile application.

Technology is a key enabler to our growth and separating our information technology systems from Victoria's Secret & Co. (as described below under "Information Systems") will enable us to make future strategic investments to strengthen our omnichannel capabilities. 
Real Estate
Company-operated Stores
The following table provides the number of our Company-operated retail stores as of January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022:

 | January 28, 2023 | January 29, 2022
United States | 1,693 | 1,651 | 
Canada | 109 | 104 | 
Total | 1,802 | | 1,755

The following table provides the changes in the number of our Company-operated retail stores for the past three fiscal years:

 | Beginningof Year | Opened | | Closed | | End of Year
2022 | 1,755 | | 95 | | (48) | | 1,802
2021 | 1,736 | | 54 | | (35) | | 1,755
2020 | 1,739 | | 27 | | (30) | | 1,736

We have a diversified store portfolio in the U.S. and Canada across venue tiers and types, with approximately half of our stores located off-mall as of January 28, 2023. We are continuing our off-mall expansion to limit our exposure to vulnerable mall locations. As a result of our strong brand and established retail presence, we have been able to lease high-traffic locations in most retail centers in which we operate. We proactively manage our stores and adjust our investment levels based on individual store and fleet performance. 
Over time, we expect low-single digit annual increases in North American square footage, with off-mall penetration steadily increasing. We will open new stores in emerging non-mall venues or as replacement stores for non-viable malls, while closing stores in non-viable or declining malls. During 2022, we opened 95 new, off-mall stores and permanently closed 48 stores, principally in malls, in North America, resulting in net square footage growth of 5% for the year. We are planning approximately 115 total real estate projects in 2023, consisting of approximately 90 new, off-mall stores and 25 remodels to our store design that incorporates our White Barn concept, partially offset by approximately 50 mall closures. We expect these projects to yield square footage growth of approximately 4% during 2023.
Our White Barn store design has demonstrated potential to increase sales and profitability, as White Barn locations typically experience increased sales and traffic following completion of the remodel. Approximately two-thirds of our stores were in the White Barn store design as of January 28, 2023, and we expect to prioritize the remaining higher performing core stores for conversion to the White Barn store design in viable locations over the next five years.
Franchise, License and Wholesale Arrangements
In addition to our Company-operated stores, our products are sold at partner-operated locations and websites in more than 45 countries through franchise, license and wholesale arrangements. Our partner-based, asset-light business model allows us to establish operating standards by owning assortment, pricing architecture, promotions, store designs and real estate approval while our partners make investments and contribute as experts in local real estate, people and practices. 
The following table provides the number of international stores operated by our partners as of January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022:
 | January 28, 2023 | January 29, 2022
International | 401 | | 317
International - Travel Retail | 26 | | 21 
Total | 427 | | 338

Additionally, our partners operated 31 international e-commerce sites as of January 28, 2023, compared to 27 as of January 29, 2022.
Revenue recognized under franchise and license arrangements generally consists of royalties earned and recognized upon sale of merchandise by franchise and license partners to retail customers. Revenue is generally recognized under wholesale and sourcing arrangements at the time the title to the products passes to the partner.

Additional Information
Merchandise Vendors
During 2022, we purchased merchandise from approximately 120 vendors, primarily located in the U.S. Our largest vendor supplied approximately 13% of our total merchandise purchases during 2022, while no other single vendor provided more than 10% of our merchandise purchases. Our five largest vendors supplied approximately 38% of our total merchandise purchases on a combined basis during 2022.
Distribution and Merchandise Inventory
Most of our merchandise is produced in the U.S. and is shipped to our distribution centers in the Columbus, Ohio area. In addition to our Company-operated distribution centers, we also utilize third-party logistics providers to warehouse and distribute product throughout North America. We proactively evaluate our distribution channels to ensure we are able to provide the right product at the right place to meet or exceed our customers’ expectations. Our policy is to maintain sufficient quantities of inventories on hand in our retail stores, fulfillment centers and distribution centers to enable us to meet customer demand.
We continue to actively manage our inventory to adjust for anticipated channel shifts and product category shifts. The current macroeconomic environment, including the impacts of continued inflationary cost pressure, requires agility, and we believe we are leveraging the speed that we have in our supply chain, our close partnerships with our suppliers and the capabilities of our sourcing, production and logistics teams to respond quickly. We believe Beauty Park and our predominantly domestic, vertically integrated supply chain enable us to successfully navigate a dynamic environment and present full and abundant product assortments on time to our customers with speed and agility.
Information Systems
Our management information systems consist of a full range of retail, financial and merchandising systems. The systems include applications related to point-of-sale, e-commerce, merchandising, planning, sourcing, logistics, inventory management, data security and support systems, including human resources and finance systems. Victoria's Secret & Co. currently administers and maintains operations of most existing technology and serves as a principal technology service provider to us under a transition services agreement we entered into in connection with the Separation ("TSA"). During the first quarter of 2022, we elected to accelerate the work of establishing separate information technology capabilities for the Company. Initiatives to separate systems are underway and we expect this work to be substantially completed in the summer of 2023. We believe the completion of the technology separation will enable us to more quickly develop critical capabilities to enhance our omnichannel capabilities and support the growth and profitability of our business.
Seasonal Business
Our operations are seasonal in nature and consist of two principal selling seasons: Spring (the first and second quarters) and Fall (the third and fourth quarters). The fourth quarter, including the holiday season, typically accounts for approximately one-third of our net sales and is our most profitable quarter. Accordingly, cash requirements are highest in the third quarter as our inventories build in advance of the holiday season. 
Working Capital 
We fund our business operations through a combination of available cash and cash equivalents and cash flows generated from operations. In addition, our credit facility is available for additional working capital needs and investment opportunities. 
Regulation
We and our products are subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign regulatory authorities. We are subject to a variety of tax and customs regulations and international trade arrangements.
Intellectual Property
Our trademarks, copyrights and patents, which constitute our primary intellectual property, have been registered or are the subject of pending applications in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and with the registries of many foreign countries and/or are protected by common law. We believe our products are identified by our intellectual property and our intellectual property is an integral tool in protecting innovation. Thus, we believe our intellectual property is of significant value. Accordingly, we intend to maintain our intellectual property and related registrations and vigorously protect our intellectual property assets against infringement.
Competition
The sale of home fragrance, body care and soap and sanitizer products is a highly competitive business with numerous competitors, including individual and chain specialty stores, department stores, online retailers and discount retailers. Brand image, presentation, marketing, design, price, service, fulfillment, assortment and quality are the principal competitive factors.

Human Capital Management
Human Capital
At Bath & Body Works, our purpose goes beyond selling product. We work to make a difference in our communities and foster a safe, welcoming, inclusive and empowering workplace for our thousands of associates.
The Human Capital and Compensation Committee (the “HCC Committee”) of our Board oversees, amongst other things, the Company’s programs, policies, practices and strategies relating to culture, talent, diversity, equity and inclusion, equal employment opportunities and the Company’s executive compensation programs. Our Board oversees the succession planning process for our Chief Executive Officer.
Workforce Demographics
As of January 28, 2023, we employed approximately 57,200 associates, 48,400 of whom were part-time. The Company supplements resources using temporary associates during peak periods, such as the end-of-the-year holiday season. Approximately 94% of our associates work in our stores, 3% in our distribution and fulfillment centers and the balance in our home office locations. None of our associates in the U.S. are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
Our customer base is predominantly women, and we ensure that we reflect this in our associate population and on our Board. As of December 31, 2022, women made up approximately 88% of our associate population, approximately 55% of our director level and above associate population and approximately 53% of our senior vice president level and above associate population. In addition, as of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, four of our six executive officers are women, including Gina R. Boswell, our Chief Executive Officer, and six of our 13 members of the Board are women, including Sarah E. Nash, our independent Board Chair and Patricia S. Bellinger, the Chair of our Nominating and Governance Committee.
In addition to gender diversity, we have a goal of employing a racially diverse workforce where everyone belongs and contributes fully to our success. As of December 31, 2022, our workforce was composed of 44% non-white associates, including 13% of leadership associates at the director level and above. In addition, as of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, two of our six executive officers and four of our 13 members of the Board were people of color.
Focus on Inclusion
We focus on recruiting, retaining and advancing diverse talent that reflects the customers we serve and the communities where we live and work. By continuing to encourage and support a workplace environment where diversity, equity and inclusion ("DEI") are valued, we believe we can serve our customers better, as well as attract and retain highly talented associates, suppliers and vendors of different backgrounds and experiences.
Led by our Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and with oversight from the HCC Committee, we have a DEI strategy based around our associates, business and communities:
•Recruitment: Increase the diversity of candidate slates and hires for all roles, with a specific focus on increasing representation of racially diverse associates at the director level and above. 
•Education and Development: Provide culturally significant learning, professional development and growth opportunities for all associates. 
•Engagement and Retention: Foster a culture of inclusion that engages associates in meaningful opportunities to build community. 
•Business: Leverage the voices of diverse associates and internal and external relationships to improve the customer experience and ensure our marketing and product assortment resonates with our customers. 
•Supplier Diversity: Provide diverse companies sustainable, long-standing business opportunities through partnerships with us.
•Community: Increase volunteerism and investment in organizations focused on racial equity, gender equity and social justice.
More than 90% of our corporate associates at the director level and above had completed DEI training as of January 28, 2023, which includes training on unconscious bias, equity and conscious inclusion. The training emphasizes both the Company’s and associates’ responsibilities to build an inclusive culture at the Company and accountability for senior leaders. In addition, as of January 28, 2023, more than 95% of our corporate associates had completed our core DEI online learning module made available to new hires during their onboarding. To further strengthen our commitment to advancing DEI, under the leadership

of our Chief Executive Officer, we joined the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion in December 2022, pledging to cultivate environments that support open dialogue on complex DEI conversations and share DEI best practices.
We currently have eight associate Inclusion Resource Groups (up from five in 2021) that provide opportunities for associates to connect with one another around their shared passion for creating an inclusive workplace for all associates. These groups provide professional development for associates, support the needs of the business, help shape the culture of our Company and provide engagement and volunteerism in the community. The Inclusion Resource Group programming is open to all associates who identify with, or are allies of, the following groups: Hispanic and Latino; LGBTQIA+; Black and African American; Asian and Pacific Islander; entry level and early career professionals; associates with disabilities and caregivers; military and veteran community; and women. During 2022, we hosted 58 events with approximately 8,800 attendees, and our associates volunteered more than 4,000 hours of time to non-profits in the communities where our associates are based.
The Company was recognized by The Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index as a 2022 "Best Place to Work for LGBTQIA+ Equality." For the fifth year in a row, the Company received a perfect score on the index, which rates companies on detailed criteria in the following four areas:
•Non-discrimination policies across business entities;
•Equitable benefits for LGBTQIA+ workers and their families;
•Supporting inclusive culture; and
•Corporate social responsibility.
Most recently, Newsweek announced that the Company is considered one of America’s Greatest Workplaces for Women in 2023. Companies are selected by those with the highest rankings on criteria such as “compensation and benefits”, “work-life balance” and “proactive management of a diverse workforce.” In addition, the Company was included on the Forbes Best Large Employer 2023 list. The ranking is determined by participants who rate their willingness to recommend their own employers to friends and family, followed by nominating organizations other than their own. We are also proud to be named a Diversity First Top 50 Company in 2023 by the Diversity Research Institute, which recognizes employers following extensive research and analysis into the racial and gender diversity of executive and board membership. 
These designations are some of the ways we have been recognized for our ongoing commitment to DEI. 
Commitment to Equitable and Competitive Wages
We are committed to equal opportunity and treatment for all associates which includes equal career advancement opportunities and equitable and competitive wages. Our commitment to pay equity is evaluated by conducting periodic assessments of pay equity based on gender, race and ethnicity. In addition, we evaluate fairness of total compensation with reference to both internal and external comparisons. 
Our compensation programs are designed to link annual changes in compensation to overall Company performance, as well as each individual’s contribution to the results achieved. Our pay for performance philosophy includes participation of our store leaders and all salaried associates in home office and distribution and fulfillment centers in our short-term cash incentive compensation program. In addition, our store leaders earn monthly bonuses based on performance. The emphasis on overall Company performance is intended to align the associates’ financial interests with the interests of our stockholders. 
Commitment to Providing Quality Benefits
We offer competitive, performance-based compensation; a company-matched savings and retirement plan; and flexible and affordable health, wellness and lifestyle benefits. Subject to certain eligibility requirements, associates can choose benefits and resources that fit their lifestyle, including, but not limited to, 14 weeks paid maternity leave, six weeks paid paternity leave, mental health benefits, family planning benefits including fertility, adoption and surrogacy, expanded bereavement leave time, military leave, tuition assistance, free access to life planning services and a generous merchandise discount. 
During 2022, we expanded our benefits with the addition of commuter benefits and a tobacco cessation program. In addition, we enhanced our associate stock purchase plan to allow associates to purchase Company stock at a discount.
Associate Engagement and Development
We are committed to investing in all our associates. During 2022, we conducted a survey of our home office workforce to assess associate engagement, culture, leadership communication and effectiveness, diversity and inclusion efforts, work-life balance and career development. In 2022, 87% of associates responded to the survey with an 84% favorable engagement rate. Leaders created action plans that were incorporated into their annual goals in response to input received via the survey. 
We provide diverse learning opportunities and challenging work experiences. We believe that associates can reach their career goals through multiple roles, career paths and locations. We offer a variety of enrichment experiences for those joining us as interns, new graduates, in mid-career or as a capstone to a career. Examples include:

•English as a Second Language Classes: A new offering for our distribution center associates, many of whom have English as a second language.
•Maintenance Technician Training: A new offering for our distribution center associates to build skills to aid in career advancement. 
Safety Is Our Priority
We are committed to providing all of our associates a healthy and safe working environment and for protecting the safety of our customers. Our health and safety programs are designed to meet or exceed regulatory requirements for the various industry sectors of our business and in the jurisdictions in which we operate.
Code of Conduct
We have a written Code of Conduct that is based on our values and is a resource which establishes standards for employee conduct that reinforces the Company's commitment to integrity and ethical conduct. We conduct an annual Code of Conduct compliance process that requires associates to complete a Code of Conduct disclosure and a separate training course. 
We maintain an Ethics Hotline, operated by a third-party, 24 hours a day, seven days a week where associates may anonymously report potential instances of unethical conduct and potential violations of law or Company policies.
