Item 1. Business.
 
The Company was incorporated in the State of New York on July 22, 1955 and is engaged in the design, development, manufacture and marketing of shock absorption, rate control, and energy storage devices for use in various types of machinery, equipment and structures. In addition to manufacturing and selling existing product lines, the Company continues to develop new and advanced technology products.
 
Principal Products
 
The Company manufactures and sells a single group of very similar products that have many different applications for customers. These similar products are included in one of eight categories; namely, Seismic Dampers, Fluidicshoks速, Crane and Industrial Buffers, Self-Adjusting Shock Absorbers, Liquid Die Springs, Vibration Dampers, Machined Springs and Custom Actuators. Management does not track or otherwise account for sales broken down by these categories. The following is a summary of the capabilities and applications for these products.
 
Seismic Dampers are designed to mitigate the effects of earthquake tremors on structures, and represent a substantial part of the business of the Company. Fluidicshoks速 are small, extremely compact shock absorbers with up to 19,200 inch-pound capacities, produced in 15 standard sizes for primary use in the defense, aerospace and commercial industry. Crane and industrial buffers are larger versions of the Fluidicshoks速 with up to 60,000,000 inch-pound capacities, produced in more than 60 standard sizes for industrial application on cranes, ships, container ships, railroad cars, truck docks, ladle and ingot cars, ore trolleys and car stops. Self-adjusting shock absorbers, which include versions of Fluidicshoks速 and crane and industrial buffers, automatically adjust to different impact conditions, and are designed for high cycle application primarily in heavy industry. Liquid die springs are used as component parts of machinery and equipment used in the manufacture of tools and dies. Vibration dampers are used primarily by the aerospace and defense industries to control the response of electronics and optical systems subjected to air, ship, or spacecraft vibration. Machined springs are precisely controlled mechanical springs manufactured from a variety of materials. These are used primarily for aerospace applications that require custom features that are not possible with conventional wound coil springs. Custom actuators are typically of the gas-charged type, using high pressure, that have custom features not available from other suppliers. These actuators are used for special military and aerospace applications.
 
Distribution
 
The Company uses the services of more than 15 sales representatives and distributors in the United States and Canada along with more than 30 representatives and distributors throughout the rest of the world. Specialized technical sales in aerospace and custom marketing activities are serviced by several sales agents, under the direction and with the assistance of the Company's President. Sales representatives typically have non-exclusive, yearly agreements with the Company, which, in most instances, provide for payment of commissions on sales at 10% of the product's net aggregate selling price. Distributors also have non-exclusive, yearly agreements with the Company to purchase the Company's products for resale purposes.
Competition
 
The Company faces competition on mature aerospace and defense programs which may use more conventional products manufactured under less stringent government specifications. Two foreign companies are the Company's competitors in the production of crane buffers.
 

The Company competes directly against two other firms supplying structural damping devices for use in the United States. For structural applications outside of the USA, the Company competes directly with several other firms particularly in Japan, China and Taiwan. The Company competes with numerous other firms that supply alternative seismic protection technologies.

Raw Materials and Supplies
 
The principal raw materials and supplies used by the Company in the manufacture of its products are provided by numerous U.S. and foreign suppliers. The loss of any one of these would not materially affect the Company's operations.
Dependence Upon Major Customers
 
The Company is not dependent on any one or a few major customers. Sales to four customers approximated 36% (17%, 8%, 6% and 5%, respectively) of net sales for 2019. The loss of any or all of these customers, unless the business is replaced by the Company, could result in an adverse effect on the results for the Company.
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
 
The Company holds 12 patents expiring at different times until the year 2035.
 
Terms of Sale
 
The Company does not carry significant inventory for rapid delivery to customers, and goods are not normally sold with return rights such as are available for consignment sales. The Company had no inventory out on consignment and no consignment sales for the years ended May 31, 2019 and 2018. No extended payment terms are offered. During the year ended May 31, 2019, delivery time after receipt of orders averaged 8 to 10 weeks for the Company's standard products. Due to the volatility of construction and aerospace/defense programs, progress payments are usually required for larger projects using custom designed components of the Company.
Need for Government Approval of Principal Products or Services
 
Contracts between the Company and the federal government or its independent contractors are subject to termination at the election of the federal government. Contracts are generally entered into on a fixed price basis. If the federal government should limit defense spending, these contracts could be reduced or terminated, which management believes would have a materially adverse effect on the Company.
Research and Development
 
The Company does not generally engage in major product research and development activities in connection with the design of its products, except when funded by aerospace customers or the federal government. The Company, however, engages in research testing of its products. For the fiscal years ended May 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company expended $319,000 and $263,000, respectively, on manufacturing research. This increase is primarily due to research and development required to meet new types of specifications on certain domestic seismic protection contracts in the current year. For the years ended May 31, 2019 and 2018, defense sponsored research and development totaled $26,000 and $22,000, respectively.
Government Regulation
 
Compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations which have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment has had no material effect on the Company, and the Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with such provisions.
 
The Company is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Act ("OSHA") and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, which establish strict standards for the protection of employees, and impose fines for violations of such standards. The Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with OSHA provisions and does not anticipate any material corrective expenditures in the near future. The Company currently incurs only moderate costs with respect to disposal of hazardous waste and compliance with OSHA regulations.
 
The Company is also subject to regulations relating to production of products for the federal government. These regulations allow for frequent governmental audits of the Company's operations and fairly extensive testing of Company products. The Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with these regulations and does not anticipate corrective expenditures in the future.
