 Item 1. Business.
 Overview
 We are a technology-based company with a well-established clinical diagnostic business and a therapeutic development business. Our clinical diagnostic business offers molecular diagnostic testing services, comprehensive genetic testing, and high-quality anatomic pathology laboratory services designed to provide physicians and patients with clinically actionable diagnostic information to improve the quality of patient care. Our therapeutic development business is focused on developing drug candidates for treating a broad range of cancers using a novel nanoencapsulation and targeted therapy platform designed to improve the therapeutic window and pharmacokinetic profile, or PK profile, of new and existing cancer drugs. We aim to transform from a genomic diagnostic business into a fully integrated precision medicine company.
Mission and Vision
 Founded in 2011, Fulgent began with two simple ideas: flexibility and affordability. We offer and develop flexible and affordable diagnostic and genetic tests and testing services designed to improve patient care and quality of life. We strive to provide the most effective and wide-ranging genetic and diagnostic testing menu on the market. Our long-term vision is to transform from a diagnostic business into a fully integrated precision medicine company focused on oncology through the addition of Fulgent Pharma Holdings, Inc., or Fulgent Pharma.
Our Clinical Diagnostic Tests and Testing Services
 We have broad testing capabilities with a testing and testing services menu that is scalable and affordable to our customers. Our testing and testing services include:
 Our comprehensive anatomic pathology tests and testing services include gastrointestinal pathology, dermatopathology, urologic pathology, breast pathology, neuropathology, and hematopathology. We plan to leverage our existing managed care contract networks and physician relationships to provide diagnostic testing and testing services complimentary to this testing portfolio. These tests and testing services are supported by our expansive geographic presence with several CLIA-licensed laboratories in the United States.
 Our specialized oncology tests and testing services utilize a wide array of technologies. These test and testing services utilize flow cytometry, cytogenetic analysis, florescence in-situ (FISH), immunohistochemistry, molecular genetics, NGS, and consultations in hematopathology and surgical pathology.
  We also offer NGS services and have experienced recent traction in NGS services related to hereditary cancer, cardiovascular genetics, reproductive health, neurodegenerative genetics, and our recently launched pharmacogenetic tests.
 Individual customers may also purchase certain tests and testing services through our direct-to-consumer Picture Genetics platform. These Picture Genetics tests help customers identify important health markers in their personal DNA.
 Our Technology Platform
Our business is built on our proprietary technology platform, which includes proprietary gene probes, data suppression and comparison algorithms, adaptive learning software, and proprietary laboratory information management systems. This platform provides a broad test menu, the ability to rapidly develop and launch new tests, customizable test offerings, lower costs per test, and high efficiency. As an example, this technology platform allowed us to rapidly respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and scale our business to provide COVID-19 tests with reliable results and rapid turnaround time in a way that surpassed even our largest competitors. We are proud that through this effort we supplied approximately 19.3 million COVID-19 tests from 2020 through 2022, generating over $1.7 billion in revenue.
Our Customers
 We currently classify our customers by their payor types: (i) Insurance, including claims covered by the Health Resources & Services Administration, or HRSA, COVID-19 Uninsured Program for uninsured individuals; (ii) Institutional, including hospitals, medical institutions, other laboratories, governmental bodies, payors, municipalities, and large corporations; and (iii) Patients who pay directly. Typically, we bill our Institutional customers for our tests, and they are responsible for paying us directly and billing their patients separately or obtaining reimbursement from third-party payors. In some cases, Institutional customers receive a per-visit or per-admission payment that includes our testing, which means that separate reimbursement is not available. A small percentage of our customers are patients, who elect to pay for tests themselves with out-of-pocket payments after their physicians have ordered our tests.
 We consider each single billing and paying unit to be an individual customer, even though a unit may represent multiple physicians and healthcare providers ordering tests. Aggregating customers that are under common control, one of our customers, the County of Los Angeles, contributed 19% and 26% of our total revenue in 2022 and 2021, respectively.
 Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing force currently consists of two internal teams of sales and marketing professionals, respectively, with deep experience in our industry, as well as a network of field-based sales representatives who are knowledgeable about our tests. The field sales team grew significantly in 2022, mostly driven by the acquisition of Symphony Buyer, Inc., or Inform Diagnostics, and Cytometry Specialists, Inc., or CSI. Historically, we have significantly relied on organic growth and word-of-mouth among our customers to generate interest in our tests, which we believe demonstrates the value of our offering. In recent years, we have invested significant time and capital to strengthen our sales and marketing efforts, including increasing the size and restructuring the organization of our internal team, re-focusing our initiatives and strategies, and increasing the overall scope of our marketing activities. On a regular basis, we continue to evaluate the need to grow the size of our sales team and market resources.
Our Suppliers
 We rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain laboratory substances used in the chemical reactions incorporated into our tests and testing services, which we refer to as reagents, as well as for the sequencers, collection kits, and various other equipment and materials we use in our laboratory operations. In particular, we rely on Illumina, Inc. as the sole supplier of the next generation sequencers and associated reagents we use to perform our genetic tests and as the sole provider of maintenance and repair services for these sequencers; on Roche Holdings AG for certain laboratory equipment, supplies, and services for our immunohistochemistry services; on Beckman Coulter Diagnostics for certain laboratory equipment, supplies, and services for our flow cytometry tests and testing services; and on Abbott Laboratories for certain laboratory equipment, supplies, and services for our FISH tests and testing services. While there are several sequencer suppliers that we believe could replace Illumina, and while we believe that we have sufficient alternative suppliers for our other needs, our laboratory operations could be interrupted if we encounter delays or difficulties in connection with securing these supplies, services, reagents, sequencers, other equipment, materials, or maintenance and repair services, which could occur for a variety of reasons, including if we need a replacement or temporary substitute for any of our limited or sole suppliers and are not able to locate and make arrangements with an acceptable replacement or temporary substitute.
Competition
Our competitors include dozens of companies focused on pathology, genetic, and diagnostic testing services, including specialty and reference laboratories that offer traditional single-gene and multi-gene tests and other diagnostic test providers, as well as drug delivery platform companies and 505(b)(2) drug developers in the cancer therapeutics area. Principal competitors include companies such as Quest Diagnostics Incorporated; Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings; Abbott Laboratories; Ambry Genetics, a subsidiary of Konica Minolta Inc.; Baylor Genetics; Caris Life Sciences; GeneDx Holdings Corp.; Invitae Corporation; Myriad Genetics, Inc.; Natera, Inc.; NeoGenomics Laboratories, Inc.; Perkin Elmer, Inc.; Tempus; and other commercial and academic laboratories. Other established and emerging healthcare, information technology, and service companies may develop and sell competitive tests, which may include informatics, analysis, integrated genetic tools and services for health and wellness.
 Additionally, participants in closely related markets, such as prenatal testing and clinical trial or companion diagnostic testing, could converge on offerings that are competitive with the type of tests we perform. Instances where potential competitors are aligned with key suppliers or are themselves suppliers could provide these potential competitors with significant advantages. Further, hospitals, research institutions, and eventually individual physicians and other practitioners may also seek to perform at their own facilities the type of genetic or diagnostic testing we would otherwise perform for them. In this regard, continued development of, and potential associated relative decreases in the cost of, equipment, reagents, and other materials and databases and genetic data interpretation services may enable broader direct participation in genetic testing and analysis and drive down the use of third-party testing companies such as ours. Moreover, cost decreases and increased direct participation, as well as cost-saving initiatives on the part of government entities and other third-party payors could intensify the downward pressure on the price for genetic analysis and interpretation generally. Moreover, the clinical diagnostic testing field continues to undergo significant consolidation, permitting larger clinical laboratory service providers to increase cost efficiencies and service levels and potentially resulting in more intense competition.
 We believe we compare favorably with our competitors. However, many of our competitors have longer operating histories; larger customer bases; more expansive brand recognition; deeper market penetration; substantially greater financial, technological, and research and development resources; and selling and marketing capabilities and considerably more experience dealing with third-party payors. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to changes in customer requirements or preferences, develop faster and better advancements for their technologies and tests, create and implement more successful strategies for the promotion and sale of their tests, obtain more favorable results from third-party payors regarding coverage and reimbursement for their offerings, adopt more aggressive pricing policies for their tests, secure supplies from vendors on more favorable terms, or devote substantially more resources to infrastructure and systems development. In addition, competitors may be acquired by, receive investments from, or enter into other commercial relationships with larger, well-established, and well-financed companies. Further, companies or governments that effectively control access to genetic or diagnostic testing through umbrella contracts or regional preferences could promote our competitors or prevent us from performing certain tests in certain territories. We may not be able to compete effectively against these organizations.
Fulgent Pharma
 In 2022, we completed our acquisition of Fulgent Pharma Holdings, Inc., or Fulgent Pharma. Our efforts at Fulgent Pharma are based on a novel nano-drug delivery platform technology capable of delivering various water insoluble or poorly soluble drugs. Unlike some of the drug delivery materials such as Human Serum Albumin, or HSA, which is only soluble in water, our nano-drug delivery materials used for drug candidate development are soluble not only in water, but also in various organic solvents, as well as capable of hot melt mixing with active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs. We believe these advantages will allow us to generate a
much broader range of drug candidate formulations, particularly amorphous drug candidate formulations, which can be used for both IV and oral formulations with a goal to improve PK profile, as well as safety and efficacy.
The first product candidate from this platform is FID-007, a nanoencapsulated paclitaxel, and the target markets we have chosen to investigate for this drug candidate are large and well-established, including head and neck, or H&N, pancreatic, breast, and non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, as shown in the figures below:
        Note: U.S. opportunity shown
 Sources: Evaluate Pharma, Wall Street research, and management pricing expectations
 1.H&N market opportunity for both 2ndline and 3rd line therapy
 FID-007 is currently being investigated in the United States in a Phase I clinical trial in patients diagnosed with various cancers including head and neck, ampullary, and pancreatic cancer. Top-line data from this trial is expected in the second quarter of 2023. Assuming positive data, we intend to seek regulatory approval in the United States using the 505(b)(2) pathway, which may shorten the clinical trial process and accelerate potential commercialization. We also plan to initiate Phase II clinical trials investigating the use of FID-007 in patients diagnosed with recurrent or metastatic head and neck and other cancers in late 2023 and 2024, respectively.
 Other Research and Development
We have assembled a highly qualified team with expertise in a number of fields important to our business, such as bioinformatics, genetics, software engineering, laboratory management, and sales and marketing. This team conducts all of our research and development activities, including efforts to develop and curate our expansive library of genetic information and further expand our technology platform.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of registered and unregistered intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, certain licenses, patents, trademarks, and customary contractual protections, to protect our core technology and intellectual property.
Trade Secrets
We rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology, and other proprietary information, to maintain and develop the competitive position afforded by many of our laboratory, analytic, and business practices. For example, significant elements of our genetic tests and our testing procedures, including aspects of specimen preparation, our bioinformatics algorithms, and related processes and our adaptive learning software, are based on unpatented trade secrets and know-how. We try to protect trade secrets and know-how by taking reasonable steps to keep them confidential, including entering into nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees and certain third parties, and entering into invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants that obligate them to assign to us any inventions developed in the course of their work for us.
Trademarks
We own registered and unregistered trademark and service mark rights under applicable U.S. and foreign law to distinguish and/or protect our brand, including our company name and logo.
Regulation
Federal Regulations Applicable to Our Laboratory Operations
 As we operate clinical laboratories in the United States, we are required to hold certain federal licenses, certifications, and permits to conduct our business. The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, establishes quality standards for all laboratory testing to ensure the accuracy, reliability and timeliness of patient test results. Our laboratories located in California, Texas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Arizona, and New York are CLIA-certified and are accredited by the College of American Pathologists, or CAP, a Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Service, or CMS, approved accrediting organization.
CLIA requires that we hold certificates for each of our laboratories applicable to the categories of testing that each laboratory performs and that we comply with various standards with respect to personnel qualifications, facility administration, proficiency testing, quality control and assurance, and inspections. Each of our laboratories must obtain a certificate from CMS, the agency that oversees CLIA, and CLIA compliance and certification is a prerequisite to be eligible to bill government payors and many private payors for our tests.
 We are subject to survey and inspection every two years to assess compliance with CLIA’s program standards, and we may be subject to additional unannounced inspections. We have CLIA certifications for our laboratories located in Temple City and El Monte, California; Houston and Irving, Texas; Needham, Massachusetts; Phoenix Arizona; Alpharetta, Georgia; and New York, New York. Each CLIA certification is valid for two years from the date of issuance. If one or more of our laboratories are found to be out of compliance with CLIA requirements, we may be subject to sanctions such as suspension, limitation or revocation of our CLIA certificate; a directed plan of correction; on-site monitoring; civil monetary penalties; civil injunctive suits; criminal penalties; exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs; and significant adverse publicity.
In addition, we elect to participate in the accreditation program of CAP. CMS has deemed CAP standards to be equally or more stringent than CLIA regulations and has approved CAP as a recognized accrediting organization. An inspection by CAP is performed in lieu of inspection by CMS for CAP-accredited laboratories. Because we are accredited by the CAP Laboratory Accreditation Program, we are deemed to also comply with CLIA.
State and Foreign Clinical Laboratory Licensure
Our clinical laboratories are required to maintain various state licenses issued by the respective Department of Health, based on all applicable state laws and regulations. State laws establish standards for day-to-day operations of our laboratories, including requirements with respect to the training and skills required of personnel, quality control, and proficiency testing requirements. If our clinical reference laboratories are out of compliance with the applicable state regulations, state agencies may suspend, restrict, or revoke our license to operate our clinical laboratories, assess substantial civil money penalties or impose specific corrective action plans. Any such actions could materially affect our business. Currently, we maintain good standing with all state authorities.
 Additionally, several states require licensure for the out-of-state laboratories that accept specimens originate from those states. For example, our Texas laboratories hold the out-of-state licenses from California, New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island to perform testing on specimens from these states; and our Temple City, California laboratory holds the required out-of-state
laboratory licenses from New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island in order to perform testing on specimens from these states. For laboratories holding licenses from New York, the laboratory director of those laboratories must also maintain a Certificate of Qualification issued by New York’s Department of Health, Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Program, or CLEP, in the permitted categories. The New York state laboratory laws and regulations impose stringent requirements for personnel qualifications, specimen retention, and consent for testing. Among other things, CLEP also requires approval on a test-specific basis before testing can be performed on specimens from New York.
 Other states may adopt similar licensure requirements in the future, which could require us to modify, delay, or discontinue our operations in such jurisdictions. If we identify any other state with such requirements, or if we are contacted by any other state advising us of such requirements, we intend to follow instructions from the state regulators as to how to comply with such requirements.
We are also subject to regulation in foreign jurisdictions, which we expect will increase as we seek to expand international utilization of our tests, or if jurisdictions in which we pursue operations adopt new or modified licensure requirements. Foreign licensure requirements could require review and modification of our tests in order to offer them in certain jurisdictions or could impose other limitations, such as restrictions on the transport of human blood or other tissue necessary for us to perform our tests that may limit our ability to make our tests available outside of the United States on a broad scale.
FDA Oversight of Our Tests and Testing Services
 The tests and testing services that we offer may be considered medical devices. Pursuant to its authority under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDC Act, the FDA has jurisdiction over medical devices, which are defined to include, among other things, in vitro diagnostic products, or IVDs, used for clinical purposes. The laws and regulations governing the marketing of IVDs are evolving, are extremely complex, and in many instances, there are no significant regulatory or judicial interpretations of these laws and regulations. The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, marketing and promotion, and sales and distribution of medical devices in the United States to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. In addition, the FDA regulates the import and export of medical devices.
We believe our tests fall within the definition of laboratory developed tests, or LDT. LDTs, which are a subset of IVDs that are intended for clinical use and designed, manufactured and used within a single laboratory. Although the FDA has statutory authority to assure that medical devices, including IVDs, are safe and effective for their intended uses, the FDA has historically exercised its enforcement discretion and not enforced applicable provisions of the FDC Act and regulations with respect to LDTs. As a result, we believe our diagnostic tests are not currently subject to the FDA’s enforcement of its medical device regulations and the applicable FDC Act provisions.
Even though we commercialize our tests as LDTs, our tests may in the future become subject to more onerous regulation by the FDA. If and when the FDA begins to actively enforce its premarket submission regulations with respect to LDTs generally or to any of our tests in particular, whether as a result of new legislative authority or following formal notice-and-comment rulemaking, we may be required to obtain premarket clearance for our tests under Section 510(k) of the FDC Act or approval of a pre-market approval application, or PMA. The process for submitting a 510(k) premarket notification and receiving FDA clearance usually takes from three to 12 months, but it can take significantly longer, and clearance is never guaranteed. The process for submitting and obtaining FDA approval of a PMA generally takes from one to three years or even longer, and approval is not guaranteed. PMA approval typically requires extensive clinical data and can be significantly longer, more expensive and more uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process. If premarket review is required for some or all of our tests, the FDA could require that we stop selling our tests and testing services pending clearance or approval and conduct clinical testing prior to making submissions to FDA to obtain premarket clearance or approval. The FDA could also require that we label our tests as investigational or limit the labeling claims we are permitted to make.
The FDA enforces its medical device requirements by various means, including inspection and market surveillance. If the FDA finds a violation, it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from an Untitled Letter or Warning Letter to more severe sanctions, such as: fines, injunctions and civil penalties; recall or seizure of products; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; and criminal prosecution. Failure to comply with any applicable FDA requirements could trigger a range of enforcement actions by the FDA, including warning letters, civil monetary penalties, fines, injunctions, criminal prosecution, consent decrees, repairs, replacements, refunds, recalls or seizures of products, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of operations and denial of or challenges to applications for clearance or approval, as well as significant adverse publicity.
Regulations Regarding Advertising of Laboratory Services or LDTs
 Our advertising for laboratory services and tests is subject to federal truth-in-advertising laws enforced by the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, as well as comparable state consumer protection laws. Under the Federal Trade Commission Act, or the FTC Act, the FTC is empowered, among other things, to (a) prevent unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce; (b) seek monetary redress and other relief for conduct injurious to consumers; and (c) gather and compile information and conduct investigations relating to the organization, business, practices, and management of entities engaged in commerce. The FTC has very broad enforcement authority, and failure to abide by the substantive requirements of the FTC Act and other consumer protection laws can result in administrative or judicial penalties, including civil penalties, injunctions affecting the manner in which we would be able to market services or products in the future, or criminal prosecution.
Rules and Regulations Relating to Payor Reimbursement for our Tests and Testing Services
 CPT Codes
We bill third-party payors, both commercial and government, for our tests and testing services using Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, codes, which are published by the American Medical Association, or AMA. CPT codes in their current form are not readily applied to many of the genetic tests we conduct. For example, for many of our multi-gene panels, there may not be an appropriate CPT code for one or more of the genes in a panel, in which case our test may be billed under a miscellaneous code for an unlisted molecular pathology procedure. Many third-party payors do not have a set reimbursement rate for this miscellaneous code. Prior to performing a test, we may negotiate the reimbursement rate with the payor if the benefits investigation has determined the test to be medically necessary, and the payor has issued prior authorization. When the test results are delivered, after we file the claim, we may also need to resubmit documentation or appeal a denial, which can cause delay in the reimbursement of the claim or our inability to get reimbursed.
 PAMA
In April 2014, Congress passed the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA, which included substantial changes to the way in which clinical laboratory services are priced and paid under Medicare’s CLFS. On June 23, 2016, CMS published the final rule implementing the reporting and rate-setting requirements. Under PAMA, laboratories that receive the majority of their Medicare revenue from payments made under the CLFS or the Physician Fee Schedule are required to report private payor payment rates and volumes for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests, or CDLTs, to CMS every three years (or annually for advanced diagnostic laboratory test, or ADLT). We do not believe that any of our tests meet the current definition of ADLT. We, therefore, must report private payor rates for our tests every three years. Laboratories that fail to report the required payment information may be subject to substantial civil monetary penalties.
 As required under PAMA, CMS uses the data reported by laboratories to develop Medicare payment rates for laboratory tests equal to the volume-weighted median of the private payor payment rates. For tests furnished on or after January 1, 2010, Medicare payments for CDLTs are based upon reported private payor rates. For a CDLT that is assigned a new or substantially revised CPT code, the initial payment rate is assigned using the gap-fill methodology, as under prior law.
On December 20, 2019, President Trump signed the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, which included the Laboratory Access for Beneficiaries Act, or LAB Act. The LAB Act delayed by one year the reporting of payment data under PAMA for CDLTs that are not ADLTs until the first quarter of 2021. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, which was signed into law on March 27, 2020, delayed the reporting period by an additional year, until the first quarter of 2022. Then, on December 10, 2021, Congress passed the Protecting Medicare and American Farmers from Sequester Cuts Act, which included a provision that further delayed the next PAMA reporting period for CDLTs that are not ADLTs to January 1, 2023 through March 31, 2023. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, enacted on December 29, 2022, delayed the next PAMA reporting period to January 1, 2024 through March 31, 2024. New CLFS rates for CDLTs will be established based on that data beginning in 2025, subject to phase-in limits. As a result, Medicare payment rates determined by data reported in 2017 will continue through December 31, 2026.
 In addition, under PAMA, as amended, the payment reduction cap will be 15% per test per year in each of the years 2024 through 2026.
Rules and Regulations Applicable to Our Research and Development Activities
 We engage in research and development activities, including research and development activities through our wholly owned subsidiary, Fulgent Pharma. Development of therapeutic products is subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. Therapeutic products require government authorization before they may be clinically tested and commercially marketed for
human therapeutic use in the United States and other countries. The precise regulatory requirements with which we will have to comply are undergoing periodic revisions and refinement.
 The steps required before a therapeutic product may be marketed in the United States are numerous and include, but are not limited to, the following:
 •completion of non-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies, chemical process development, and formulation studies according to good laboratory practices and other applicable regulations and guidance; 
 •the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may commence;
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials according to good clinical practices, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the therapeutic candidate for its intended use;
 •the submission of a New Drug Application, or NDA, to the FDA; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the therapeutic candidate is produced to assess readiness for commercial manufacturing and conformance to the manufacturing-related elements of the application, to conduct a data integrity audit, and to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate; and
 •FDA review and approval of the NDA.
 The testing and formulation processes required to market a therapeutic product involves substantial time, effort, and financial resources; and we cannot be certain that any approvals for any of our future therapeutic products will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
An institutional review board, or IRB, for each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve a new clinical protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution and must also approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each research subject or the subject’s legal representative, monitor the trial until completed, and otherwise comply with IRB regulations. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.

Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 •Phase 1: Initial safety study in healthy human subjects or patients where the candidate therapy is tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. 
 •Phase 2: Studies in a limited patient population designed to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to determine the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases, and to determine tolerance and optimal dosage. 
 •Phase 3: Studies in an expanded patient population to further evaluate clinical efficacy and to further test for safety.
 We cannot be certain that we will successfully complete Phase 1, Phase 2, or Phase 3 testing of any product candidate within any specific time period, if at all. Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as “Phase 4” clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, FDA may mandate the performance of “Phase 4” clinical trials.
Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements, or if the therapeutic candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the non-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with detailed descriptions of the product’s chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC), proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of a NDA requesting approval to market the product. Most innovative drug products obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDC Act, commonly referred to as a traditional or “full NDA.” In 1984, with passage of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act, informally known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, that established an abbreviated regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve generic drugs based on an innovator or “reference” product, Congress also enacted Section 505(b)(2) of the FDC Act, which provides a hybrid pathway combining features of a traditional NDA and a generic drug application. Section 505(b)(2) enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s prior findings of safety and efficacy data for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. Section 505(b)(2) NDAs may provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously
approved products; for example, an applicant may be seeking approval to market a previously approved drug for new indications or for a new patient population that would require new clinical data to demonstrate safety or effectiveness. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA in which the applicant relies, at least in part, on information from studies made to show whether a drug is safe or effective that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use. A Section 505(b)(2) applicant may eliminate or reduce the need to conduct certain non-clinical or clinical studies, if it can establish that reliance on studies conducted for a previously-approved product is scientifically appropriate.
  Even if a product receives marketing approval, the approval may be limited to specific indications and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk mitigation plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials and/or testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
  Satisfaction of the above FDA requirements or similar requirements of foreign regulatory agencies typically takes several years, and the actual time required may vary substantially, based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or indication. Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of potential products for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon us or our partners’ activities. The FDA or any other regulatory agency may not grant any approvals on a timely basis, if at all. Success in early-stage clinical trials does not assure success in later-stage clinical trials. Data obtained from clinical activities is not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit, or prevent regulatory approval. Even if a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific indications and dosages. Delays in obtaining, or failures to obtain regulatory approvals may have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we cannot predict what adverse governmental regulations may arise from future U.S. or foreign governmental action.
  Following approval of a new therapeutic product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping activities; reporting of adverse experiences with the product, samples, and distribution restrictions; complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations (i.e., “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses.
  Moreover, if there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or an NDA supplement, which may require the applicant to develop additional data or conduct additional non-clinical studies and clinical trials. Even if such trials are conducted, the FDA may not approve any expansion of the labeled indications for use in a timely fashion, or at all.
 In addition, FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports, and returned or salvaged products. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved therapeutics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA to assess compliance with cGMP and other requirements. Accordingly, both sponsors and manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance and other aspects of quality control and quality assurance, and to ensure ongoing compliance with other statutory requirements of the FDC Act. We cannot be certain that we or our suppliers will be able to comply with cGMP regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements.
  Accordingly, even after a new drug approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained, or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or the imposition of distribution or other restrictions. Other potential consequences of regulatory non-compliance include, among other things, fines, warning letters or other enforcement-related letters or clinical holds on post-approval clinical trials; product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and/or consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment, or exclusion from federal health care programs.

Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations and Patient Information Access Laws and Regulations Applicable to Our Business
 HIPAA and HITECH
Under the Administrative Simplification provisions of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the federal Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has issued regulations, or HIPAA Regulations, that establish uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and requirements for protecting the privacy and security of protected health information, or PHI, used or disclosed by healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses that conduct certain healthcare transactions electronically, known as “covered entities.” As a clinical laboratory, we are acting as a covered entity and are subject to HIPAA and HITECH. The following four principal regulations with which we are required to comply have been issued in final form under HIPAA and HITECH: privacy regulations, security regulations, the breach notification rule, and standards for electronic transactions, which establish standards for common healthcare transactions.
The privacy regulations of HIPAA and HITECH protect medical records and other PHI by limiting their use and release, giving patients a variety of rights, including the right to access their medical records, and limiting most disclosures of health information to the minimum amount necessary to accomplish an intended purpose. HIPAA also requires covered entities to enter into business associate agreements to obtain a written assurance of compliance with HIPAA from individuals or organizations who provide services to covered entities involving the use or disclosure of PHI, or also known as “business associates.” As a general rule, a covered entity or business associate may not use or disclose PHI, except as permitted under the privacy regulations of HIPAA and HITECH.
Covered entities must also comply with the security regulations of HIPAA and HITECH, which establish requirements for safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic PHI. The HIPAA security regulations require the implementation of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards and the adoption of written security policies and procedures.
 In addition, HITECH established, among other things, certain breach notification requirements with which covered entities must comply. In particular, a covered entity must report breaches of PHI that have not been encrypted or otherwise secured in accordance with guidance from the Secretary of HHS, or the Secretary. Required breach notices must be made as soon as is reasonably practicable, but no later than sixty days following discovery of the breach. Reports must be made to affected individuals, the Secretary, and, depending on the size of the breach, the local and national media. Covered entities are also subject to audit under HHS’s HITECH-mandated audit program and may be investigated in connection with privacy or data security.
 There are significant civil and criminal fines and other penalties that may be imposed for violating HIPAA. A covered entity or business associate is liable for civil monetary penalties for a violation that is based on an act or omission of any of its agents, including a downstream business associate, as determined according to the federal common law of agency. Penalties for failure to comply with a requirement of HIPAA and HITECH vary significantly depending on the failure and include civil monetary penalties of up to approximately $1.9 million per violation of the same requirement per calendar year (as of March 2022, subject to annual inflation adjustments). A single breach incident can violate multiple requirements, resulting in potential penalties in excess of $1.9 million. Additionally, a person who knowingly obtains or discloses individually identifiable health information in violation of HIPAA may face a criminal penalty of up to $50,000 and up to one year of imprisonment. These criminal penalties increase if the wrongful conduct involves false pretenses or the intent to sell, transfer or use identifiable health information for commercial advantage, personal gain, or malicious harm. Covered entities are also subject to enforcement by state attorneys general who were given authority to enforce HIPAA under HITECH. Further, to the extent that we submit electronic healthcare claims and payment transactions that do not comply with the electronic data transmission standards established under HIPAA and HITECH, payments to us may be delayed or denied.
In addition to our clinical laboratory services, we provide management and technology services to certain companies, institutions, and agencies that are covered entities and have entered into business associate agreements with these entities as business associates. In addition to being directly responsible for compliance with applicable HITECH Act requirements and HIPAA regulations as a business associate, we have contractually agreed to comply with HITECH and HIPAA Regulations; and in some instances, we have agreed to indemnify our covered entity clients if we breach our obligations with respect to these laws and regulations and/or in the event of a reportable breach of PHI.
 CMIA
 The HIPAA privacy, security, and breach notification regulations establish a uniform federal “floor” but do not supersede state laws that are more stringent or that provide individuals with greater rights with respect to the privacy or security of, and access to, their records containing PHI, or insofar as such state laws apply to personal information that is broader in scope than PHI, as defined under HIPAA. The compliance requirements of these laws, including additional breach reporting requirements, and the penalties for violation vary widely, and new privacy and security laws in this area are evolving. For example, several states, such as California, have implemented comprehensive privacy laws and regulations. The California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act, or CMIA, imposes restrictive requirements regulating the use and disclosure of health information and other personally identifiable information.
In addition to fines and penalties imposed upon violators, some of these state laws also afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. California’s patient privacy laws, for example, provide for penalties of up to $250,000 and permit injured parties to sue for damages.
CCPA/CPRA
 In addition to the CMIA, California recently adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, which came into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA established a new privacy framework for covered businesses by creating an expanded definition of personal information, establishing new data privacy rights for California consumers, imposing special rules on the collection of consumer data from minors, and creating a new and potentially severe statutory damages framework for businesses that violate the CCPA and/or fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Although the CCPA does not directly apply to medical information covered by HIPAA or CMIA, certain other personal information that our business may collect and use is within the scope of the CCPA and does not fall under the CCPA exception. Additionally, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, which expanded the CCPA, became effective on January 1, 2023 and, among other things, it established the California Privacy Protection Agency, or CPPA, a new regulatory authority charged with administering and enforcing the CRPA and privacy rights in California. The CPPA has the power to levy fines and bring other enforcement actions and is in the process of implementing further regulations that could have operational impacts. In addition to California, other states have similar privacy laws taking effect in 2023, including Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, and Utah. There are also several federal privacy proposals under consideration in Congress, and other states have already introduced privacy legislation for consideration in 2023. The CPRA and other state privacy laws could impact our operations or that of our collaborators and business partners and impose new regulatory requirements and increase costs of compliance.
Information Blocking Rules
 The National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, or ONC, coordinates the ongoing development of standards to enable interoperable health information technology infrastructure nationwide in the healthcare sector. In May 2020, ONC released the final Information Blocking Rule to implement the interoperability and patient access provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act, which took effect in 2021. We need to continually engage in ongoing reviews of all potential practices that could be considered likely to interfere with access, exchange, or use of electronic health information, as those practices are prohibited by the Information Blocking Rule unless one of the exceptions outlined in the Information Blocking Rule applies. Among other things, the Information Blocking Rule requires us to provide patients with on-demand access to laboratory test results. These requirements can be inconsistent with our obligations under state law and/or medical or ethical standards. It is currently unclear how the ONC will approach delays in providing patient access in these situations. Health care providers, including laboratories, are subject to civil monetary penalties for violations of the Information Blocking Rule, up to $1 million per violation.
Foreign Laws and Other Laws
 We are also subject to foreign privacy laws in the jurisdictions in which we sell our tests. The interpretation, application, and interplay of consumer and health-related data protection laws in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere are often uncertain, contradictory, and in flux. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and Cybersecurity Directive have been enacted in the European Union and became effective in May 2018. These regulations introduced many changes to privacy and security in the European Union, including stricter rules on consent and security duties for critical industries, including for the health sector generally and for genetic data specifically. The interpretation of some rules continues to evolve in guidance from the main regulatory authority, the European Data Protection Board, and some requirements may be completed by national legislation. This makes it difficult to assess the impact of these foreign data protection laws on our business at this time. More generally, foreign laws and interpretations governing data privacy and security are constantly evolving, and it is possible that laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our current practices, in which case we could be subject to government-imposed fines or orders requiring that we change our practices. These fines can be very high. For instance, the GDPR provides for fines of up to approximately $22 million or 4% of a group’s worldwide annual turnover for certain infringements. In addition, privacy regulations differ widely from country to country and are enforced by individual country data protection authorities, which have power to enforce privacy regulations. Various data protection authorities have issued fines in the millions of euros for violations of privacy laws. Many states have also implemented genetic testing and privacy laws imposing specific patient consent requirements and requirements for protecting test results. The interplay of federal and state laws may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues for us and our clients and potentially exposing us to additional expense, adverse publicity, and legal and regulatory liability. Further, as regulatory focus on privacy issues continues to increase, and laws and regulations concerning the protection of personal information expand and become more complex, these potential risks to our business could intensify. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer, health-related, and data protection laws are often uncertain, contradictory, and in flux. For example, increasing concerns about health information privacy have recently prompted the federal government to issue guidance, taking a newly expansive view of the scope of the laws and regulations that they enforce. The applicability and requirements of these laws and penalties for violations vary widely. Failure to maintain compliance, or changes in
state or federal laws regarding privacy or security, could result in civil and/or criminal penalties and damages and could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 Numerous other federal, state, and foreign laws, including consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of patient health information. In addition, Congress and some states are considering new laws and regulations that further and more broadly protect the privacy and security of medical records or health information. With the recent increase in publicity regarding data breaches resulting in improper dissemination of consumer information, all 50 states have passed laws regulating the actions that a business must take if it experiences a data breach, as defined by state law, including, in certain instances, prompt disclosure within a specified amount of time to affected individuals. Congress has also been considering similar federal legislation relating to data privacy and data protection. The FTC and states’ Attorneys General have also brought enforcement actions and prosecuted some data breach cases as unfair and/or deceptive acts or practices under the FTC Act and comparable state laws. In addition to data breach notification laws, some states have enacted statutes and rules requiring businesses to reasonably protect certain types of personal information they hold or to otherwise comply with certain specified data security requirements for personal information. We intend to continue to comprehensively protect all personal information and to comply with applicable laws regarding the protection of such information.
In many activities, including the conduct of clinical trials, we are subject to laws and regulations governing data privacy and the protection of health-related and other personal information. These laws and regulations govern our processing of personal data, including the collection, access, use, analysis, modification, storage, transfer, security breach notification, destruction, and disposal of personal data. We must comply with laws and regulations associated with the international transfer of personal data based on the location in which the personal data originates and the location in which it is processed.
 If we or our vendors fail to comply with applicable data privacy laws, or if the legal mechanisms we or our vendors rely upon to allow for the transfer of personal data from the European Union to the United States (or other countries not considered by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of data protection) are not considered adequate, we could be subject to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us, and our business could be adversely impacted if our ability to transfer personal data outside of the European Union is restricted, which could adversely impact our operating results. The GDPR has increased our responsibility and potential liability in relation to European Union personal data that we process, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR. However, our ongoing efforts related to compliance with the GDPR may not be successful and could increase our cost of doing business. In addition, data protection authorities of the different European Union member states may interpret the GDPR differently, and guidance on implementation and compliance practices is often updated or otherwise revised, which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in the European Union. In addition to the GDPR, other countries have enacted data protection legislation, which increase the complexity of doing international business and transferring sensitive personal information from those countries to the United States.
 The privacy and security of personally identifiable information stored, maintained, received, or transmitted, including electronically, is subject to significant regulation in the United States and abroad. While we strive to comply with all applicable privacy and security laws and regulations, legal standards for privacy continue to evolve, and any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others, or could cause reputational harm, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws Applicable to Our Business
 In the United States, we must comply with various fraud and abuse laws, and we are subject to regulation by various federal, state, and local authorities, including CMS, other divisions of HHS (such as the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, individual U.S. Attorney’s Offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. We also may be subject to foreign fraud and abuse laws.
Anti-Kickback and Fraud Statutes
In the United States, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in order to induce or in return for the referral of an individual for the furnishing of, or the recommending or arranging for the furnishing of, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending purchasing, leasing or ordering of any good, facility, service or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part by a federal healthcare program. Courts have stated that a financial arrangement may violate the Anti-Kickback Statute if any one purpose of the arrangement is to encourage patient referrals or other federal healthcare program business, regardless of whether there are other legitimate purposes for the arrangement. The definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including gifts, discounts, credit arrangements, payments of cash, consulting fees, waivers of co-payments, ownership interests, and providing anything at less than its fair market value. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements within the healthcare industry, although it does contain several exceptions. HHS has issued a series of regulatory “safe harbors” setting forth certain provisions that, if met, will immunize the parties to the arrangement from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Although full compliance with the statutory exceptions or regulatory safe harbors ensures against prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit within a specific statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the transaction or arrangement is illegal or that prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute will be pursued. Furthermore, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Penalties for violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute are severe and include imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute can serve as a basis of liability under the federal False Claims Act (described below). Many states also have anti-kickback statutes, some of which may apply regardless of payor type.
In addition, in October 2018, the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act of 2018, or EKRA, was enacted as part of the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act. EKRA is an all-payer anti-kickback law that makes it a criminal offense to pay any remuneration to induce referrals to, or in exchange for, patients using the services of a recovery home, a substance use clinical treatment facility, or laboratory. However, unlike the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, EKRA is not limited to services covered by federal or state health care programs but applies more broadly to services covered by “health care benefit programs,” including commercial insurers. Although it appears that EKRA was intended to reach patient brokering and similar arrangements to induce patronage of substance use recovery and treatment, the language in EKRA is broadly written. Further, certain of EKRA’s exceptions are inconsistent with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and regulations. Significantly, EKRA permits the U.S. Department of Justice to issue regulations clarifying EKRA’s exceptions or adding additional exceptions, but such regulations have not yet been issued.
 There are also U.S. federal laws related to healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government payor programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. A violation of this statute is also a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government payor programs.
False Claims Act
Another development affecting the healthcare industry is the increased enforcement of the federal False Claims Act and, in particular, actions brought pursuant to the False Claims Act’s “whistleblower” or “qui tam” provisions. The False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the federal government. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring an action under the False Claims Act on behalf of the federal government and permit such an individual to share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. In addition, providers and suppliers must report and return any overpayments received from the Medicare and Medicaid programs within 60 days of identification. Failure to identify and return such overpayments exposes the provider or supplier to False Claims Act liability. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties ranging from $5,500 to $11,000 for each false claim, as set by statute. However, the civil penalty amounts are adjusted annually for inflation. For civil penalties assessed after June 19, 2020, whose associated violations occurred after November 2, 2015, the civil penalty amount ranges between $11,665 and $23,331 per claim; as of December 13, 2021, the amounts increased to $11,803 and $23,607 per claim.
 In addition, various states have enacted false claim laws analogous to the federal False Claims Act, although many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payor and not merely a government payor program.
Civil Monetary Penalties Law
The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, or the CMP Law, prohibits, among other things, (1) the offering or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or state health care program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state health care program, unless an exception applies; (2) employing or contracting with an individual or entity that the provider knows or should know is excluded from participation in a federal health care program; (3) billing for services requested by an unlicensed physician or an excluded provider; and (4) billing for medically unnecessary services. The penalties for violating the CMP Law include exclusion, substantial fines, and payment of up to three times the amount billed, depending on the nature of the offense.
Physician Referral Prohibitions Laws and Regulations
 We are also subject to the U.S. federal law directed at “self-referrals,” commonly known as the “Stark Law,” which prohibits a physician from making referrals for certain designated health services, including laboratory services, that are covered by the Medicare program, to an entity with which the physician or an immediate family member has a direct or indirect financial relationship, unless an exception applies. Violation of the Stark Law results in a denial of payment for any services provided pursuant to a prohibited referral. A physician or entity that engages in a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law’s referral prohibition may be subject to substantial fines for each such arrangement or scheme. In addition, any person who presents or causes to be presented a claim to the Medicare program in violation of the Stark Law is subject to substantial civil monetary penalties of up to, an assessment of up to three times the amount claimed and possible exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. The Stark Law is a strict liability statute, meaning that a physician’s financial relationship with a laboratory must meet an exception under the Stark Law, or the referrals are prohibited. Thus, unlike the Anti-Kickback Statute’s safe harbors, if a laboratory’s financial relationship with a referring physician does not meet the requirements of a Stark Law exception, then the physician is prohibited from making Medicare and Medicaid referrals to the laboratory and any such referrals will result in overpayments to the laboratory and subject the laboratory to the Stark Law’s penalties. A violation of the Stark Law can serve as a basis of liability under the federal False Claims Act. Many states, including California, have comparable laws that are not limited to Medicare referrals. The Stark Law also prohibits state receipt of federal Medicaid matching funds for services furnished pursuant to a prohibited referral, but this provision of the Stark Law has not been implemented by regulations.
Physician Sunshine Laws Applicable to Our Business
 The Physician Payments Sunshine Act imposes reporting requirements on manufacturers of certain devices, drugs, and biologics for certain payments and transfers of value by them (and in some cases their distributors) to physicians, teaching hospitals, and certain advanced non-physician health care practitioners, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The reporting program, known as the Open Payments program, is administered by CMS. Because we manufacture our own LDTs solely for use by or within our own laboratory, we believe we are exempt from these reporting requirements. We may become subject to such reporting requirements under the terms of current CMS regulations, however, if the Verifying Accurate, Leading-edge IVCT Development Act, or VALID Act, or other legislation renders our tests regulated by FDA, or if FDA engages in notice-and-comment rulemaking to exercise authority over LDTs or otherwise requires us to obtain premarket clearance or approval for our tests. We also may become subject to these requirements if any therapeutic products currently in development are successfully approved by FDA and commercialized in the United States.
Anti-Bribery Laws Applicable to Our Business
 FCPA
We are subject to U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making payments in violation of law to non-U.S. government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing any other improper advantage. The sale of our tests internationally demands a high degree of vigilance in maintaining, implementing and enforcing a policy against participation in corrupt activity. Other U.S. companies in the medical device and pharmaceutical fields have faced substantial monetary fines and criminal penalties under the FCPA for allowing their agents to deviate from appropriate practices in doing business with non-U.S. government officials.
 Foreign Laws
We are also subject to similar anti-bribery laws in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. In Europe, various countries have adopted anti-bribery laws providing for severe consequences, in the form of criminal penalties and/or significant fines for individuals and/or companies committing a bribery offence. For instance, in the United Kingdom, under the Bribery Act of 2010, which became effective in July 2011, a bribery occurs when a person offers, gives, or promises to give a financial or other advantage to induce or reward another individual to improperly perform certain functions or activities, including any function of a public or private nature. Bribery of foreign public officials also falls within the scope of the Bribery Act of 2010. An individual found in
violation of the Bribery Act of 2010 faces imprisonment of up to 10 years and could be subject to an unlimited fine, as could commercial organizations for failure to prevent bribery.
Healthcare Policy Laws Applicable to Our Business
 In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, was enacted in the United States. The ACA made a number of substantial changes to the way healthcare is financed both by governmental and private payors. Although the ACA included a medical device tax, the tax never went into effect and was fully repealed by Congress with enactment of the 2019 federal spending package signed into law by President Trump on December 20, 2019.
 Since the ACA’s enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and as a result, certain sections of the ACA have not been fully implemented or were effectively repealed. However, following several years of litigation in the federal courts, in June 2021, the United States Supreme Court, or the Supreme Court, upheld the ACA when it dismissed a legal challenge to the Act’s constitutionality. Further legislative and regulatory changes under the ACA remain possible, although the new Democrat-led presidential administration has been taking steps to strengthen the ACA. Future changes or additions to the ACA, the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and changes stemming from other health care reform measures, especially with regard to health care access, financing or other legislation in individual states, could have a material adverse effect on the health care industry in the U.S. The uncertainty around the future of the ACA, and in particular the impact to reimbursement levels and the number of insured individuals, may lead to delay in the purchasing decisions of our customers.
In addition to the ACA, there will likely continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators and private third-party payors to reduce costs while expanding individual healthcare benefits. For example, in August 2022, President Biden signed into the law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or the IRA. Among other things, the IRA has multiple provisions that may impact the prices of drug products that are both sold into the Medicare program and throughout the United States. Starting in 2023, a manufacturer of drugs or biological products covered by Medicare Parts B or D must pay a rebate to the federal government if their drug product’s price increases faster than the rate of inflation. This calculation is made on a drug product by drug product basis and the amount of the rebate owed to the federal government is directly dependent on the volume of a drug product that is paid for by Medicare Parts B or D. Additionally, starting for payment year 2026, CMS will negotiate drug prices annually for a select number of single source Part D drugs without generic or biosimilar competition. CMS will also negotiate drug prices for a select number of Part B drugs starting for payment year 2028. If a drug product is selected by CMS for negotiation, it is expected that the revenue generated from such drug will decrease.
Prohibitions on the Corporate Practice of Medicine
Numerous states have enacted laws prohibiting business corporations, such as us, from practicing medicine and employing or engaging physicians to practice medicine, generally referred to as the prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine. These laws are designed to prevent interference in the medical decision-making process by anyone who is not a licensed physician. For example, California’s Medical Board has indicated that determining the appropriate diagnostic tests for a particular condition and taking responsibility for the ultimate overall care of a patient, including providing treatment options available to the patient, would constitute the unlicensed practice of medicine if performed by an unlicensed person. Violation of these corporate practice of medicine laws may result in civil or criminal fines, as well as sanctions imposed against the business corporation and/or the professional through licensure proceedings.
Environmental and Other Regulatory Requirements
Our facilities are subject on an ongoing basis to federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling, and disposal of regulated medical waste, hazardous waste, and biohazardous waste, including chemicals, biological agents and compounds and blood and other tissue specimens. Typically, we use licensed or otherwise qualified outside vendors to dispose of this waste. However, many of these laws and regulations provide for strict liability, holding a party potentially liable without regard to fault or negligence. As a result, we could be held liable for damages and fines if our, or others’, business operations or other actions result in contamination of the environment or personal injury due to exposure to hazardous materials. Our costs for complying with these laws and regulations cannot be estimated or predicted and depends on a number of factors, including the amount and nature of waste we produce, which depends in part on the number of tests we perform, and the terms we negotiate with our waste disposal vendors.
 Our operations are also subject to extensive requirements established by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration relating to workplace safety for healthcare employees, including requirements to develop and implement programs to protect workers from exposure to blood-borne pathogens by preventing or minimizing any exposure through needle stick or similar penetrating injuries.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
We believe growing and retaining a strong team is crucial to our success. As of February 15, 2023, we had 1,012 full-time employees, engaged in bioinformatics, genetic, COVID-19 and molecular testing, software engineering, laboratory management, sales and marketing, and corporate and administrative activities. Consistent with our core belief in the values of diversity and inclusion, as of December 31, 2022, underrepresented minorities (which include women, Asian, and Hispanic persons) made up 50% or more of each major level of our organization, including our board of directors, senior management, and rank and file staff. To encourage the professional and personal development of every Fulgent employee, we offer reimbursement for qualified educational expenses and successful completion of undergraduate, graduate, post-graduate, professional training, and licensure courses from accredited colleges, universities, and professional organizations. We also provide mandatory training courses on a variety of topics, including discrimination, harassment, HIPAA, insider trading, anti-corruption and anti-bribery internally and/or through third-party providers. We offer a comprehensive compensation program that is designed to attract and reward talented individuals who possess the skills necessary to support our business objectives, assist in the achievement of our strategic goals and create long-term value for our stockholders. We provide competitive salaries, stock-based compensation, and bonus programs. We also provide an expansive benefit offering including medical, dental, and vision health care coverage, life and AD&D coverage; optional legal, pet insurance, hospitalization, critical illness and accident coverage; insurance and disability coverage; 401(k) investment plans with Company matching; tax-advantaged savings accounts; paid time off and leaves of absence; and wellness programs. We provide added work life balance to our employees through hybrid work arrangements. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good.
 The following persons currently serve as the directors and executive officers of Fulgent:
