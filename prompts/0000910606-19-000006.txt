Item 1. Business
Regency Centers began its operations as a publicly-traded REIT in 1993, and, as of December 31, 2018, had full or partial ownership interests in 425 properties primarily anchored by market leading grocery stores. Our properties are principally located in affluent and infill trade areas of the United States, and contain 53.6 million square feet ("SF") of gross leasable area ("GLA"). Our ownership share of this GLA is 43.4 million square feet, including our share of the partially owned properties. All of our operating, investing, and financing activities are performed through the Operating Partnership, our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and through our co-investment partnerships.
On March 1, 2017, Regency completed its merger with Equity One Inc. ("Equity One"), whereby Equity One merged with and into Regency, with Regency continuing as the surviving public company. As part of the merger, Regency acquired 121 properties representing 16.0 million SF of GLA, including 8 properties held through co-investment partnerships. 
Our mission is to be the preeminent national owner, operator, and developer of shopping centers connecting outstanding retailers and service providers with surrounding neighborhoods and communities. Our goals are to:

• | Own and manage a portfolio of high-quality neighborhood and community shopping centers anchored by market leading grocers and located in affluent suburban and near urban trade areas in the country’s most desirable metro areas. We expect that this combination will produce highly desirable and attractive centers with best-in-class retailers. These centers should command higher rental and occupancy rates resulting in excellent prospects to grow net operating income ("NOI"); 


• | Maintain an industry leading and disciplined development and redevelopment platform to deliver exceptional retail centers at higher returns as compared to acquisitions;


• | Support our business activities with a strong balance sheet; and


• | Engage a talented, dedicated team of employees, who are guided by Regency’s strong values and special culture, which are aligned with shareholder interests.

Key strategies to achieve our goals are to:

• | Increase earnings per share and dividends and generate total shareholder returns at or near the top of our shopping center peers.


• | Sustain same property NOI growth at or near the top of our shopping center peers;


• | Develop and redevelop high quality shopping centers at attractive returns on investment;


• | Maintain a conservative balance sheet providing financial flexibility to cost effectively fund investment opportunities and debt maturities on a favorable basis, and to weather economic downturns; and


• | Attract and motivate an exceptional team of employees who operate efficiently and are recognized as industry leaders.

Corporate Responsibility
Regency’s vision is to be the preeminent national owner, operator and developer of shopping centers, connecting outstanding retailers and service providers with its neighborhoods and communities while practicing best-in-class corporate responsibility. Our corporate responsibility report highlights our commitment to stakeholders and the critical role Regency's core values have on how we practice corporate responsibility. We are committed to transparent reporting on sustainability and corporate responsibility efforts in accordance with the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative. A copy of our corporate responsibility report is available on our website, www.regencycenters.com.
Sustainability
We believe sustainability is in the best interest of our tenants, investors, employees, and the communities in which we operate and are committed to reducing our environmental impact, including energy and water use, greenhouse gas emissions, and waste. We believe this commitment is not only the right thing to do, but also supports the Company in achieving key strategic objectives in operations and development. We are committed to transparency with regard to our sustainability performance, risks and opportunities, and will continue to enhance disclosure using industry accepted reporting frameworks. More information about our sustainability strategy, goals, performance, and formal disclosures are available on our website at www.regencycenters.com.
Competition
We are among the largest owners of shopping centers in the nation based on revenues, number of properties, GLA, and market capitalization. There are numerous companies and individuals engaged in the ownership, development, acquisition, and operation of shopping centers that compete with us in our targeted markets, including grocery store chains that also anchor some of our shopping centers. This results in competition for attracting tenants, as well as the acquisition of existing shopping centers and new development sites. We believe that our competitive advantages are driven by:

• | our locations within our market areas;


• | the design and high quality of our shopping centers;


• | the strong demographics surrounding our shopping centers;


• | our relationships with our anchor tenants and our side-shop and out-parcel retailers;


• | our practice of maintaining and renovating our shopping centers; and


• | our ability to source and develop new shopping centers.

Employees
Our corporate headquarters are located at One Independent Drive, Suite 114, Jacksonville, Florida. We presently maintain 22 market offices nationwide, including our corporate headquarters, where we conduct management, leasing, construction, and investment activities. We have 446 employees throughout the United States and we believe that our relations with our employees are good.
Compliance with Governmental Regulations
Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be liable for the cost to remove or remediate certain hazardous or toxic substances at our shopping centers. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. The cost of required remediation and the owner's liability for remediation could exceed the value of the property and/or the aggregate assets of the owner. The presence of such substances, or the failure to properly remediate such substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the property or borrow using the property as collateral. Although we have a number of properties that could require or are currently undergoing varying levels of environmental remediation, known environmental remediation is not currently expected to have a material financial impact on us due to insurance programs designed to mitigate the cost of remediation, various state-regulated programs that shift the responsibility and cost to the state, and existing accrued liabilities for remediation.

Defined Terms
 In addition to the required Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") presentations, we use certain non-GAAP performance measures as we believe these measures improve the understanding of the Company's operational results. We continually evaluate the usefulness, relevance, limitations, and calculation of our reported non-GAAP performance measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public, and thus such reported measures could change.
The following terms, as defined, are commonly used by management and the investing public to understand and evaluate our operational results:

• | Same Property is a Retail Operating Property that was owned and operated for the entirety of both calendar year periods being compared. This term excludes all developments and Non-Same Properties. 


• | Non-Same Property is a property acquired, sold, or a Development Completion during either calendar year period being compared. Non-retail properties and corporate activities, including the captive insurance program, are part of Non-Same Property. 


• | Retail Operating Property is any retail property not termed a Property in Development. A retail property is any property where the majority of the income is generated from retail uses. 


• | Property In Development includes properties in various stages of development and redevelopment including active pre-development activities.


• | Development Completion is a property in development that is deemed complete upon the earliest of: (i) 90% of total estimated net development costs have been incurred and percent leased equals or exceeds 95%, or (ii) the property features at least two years of anchor operations, or (iii) three years have passed since the start of construction. Once deemed complete, the property is termed a Retail Operating Property the following calendar year.


• | Pro-Rata information includes 100% of our consolidated properties plus our economic share (based on our ownership interest) in our unconsolidated real estate investment partnerships.

We manage our entire real estate portfolio without regard to ownership structure, although certain decisions impacting properties owned through partnerships require partner approval. Therefore, we believe presenting our pro-rata share of certain operating metrics, along with other non-GAAP measures, makes comparisons of other REITs' operating results to the Company's more meaningful.
The pro-rata information is prepared on a basis consistent with the comparable consolidated amounts and is intended to more accurately reflect our proportionate economic interest in the operating results of properties in our portfolio. We do not control the unconsolidated investment partnerships, and the pro-rata presentations of the assets and liabilities, and revenues and expenses do not represent our legal claim to such items. The partners are entitled to profit or loss allocations and distributions of cash flows according to the operating agreements, which provide for such allocations according to their invested capital. Our share of invested capital establishes the ownership interests we use to prepare our pro-rata share.
The presentation of pro-rata information has limitations which include, but are not limited to, the following:

• | The amounts shown on the individual line items were derived by applying our overall economic ownership interest percentage determined when applying the equity method of accounting or allocating noncontrolling interests, and do not necessarily represent our legal claim to the assets and liabilities, or the revenues and expenses; and


• | Other companies in our industry may calculate their pro-rata interest differently, limiting the comparability of pro-rata information.

Because of these limitations, the pro-rata financial information should not be considered independently or as a substitute for our financial statements as reported under GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP financial statements, using the pro-rata information as a supplement.

• | NAREIT EBITDAre is a measure of REIT performance, which the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") defines as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding (i) interest expense, (ii) income tax expense, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) gains and losses from sales of depreciable property, (v)

 4

operating real estate impairments, and (vi) adjustments to reflect the Company's share of unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.

• | Operating EBITDAre (previously Adjusted EBITDA) begins with the NAREIT EBITDAre and excludes certain non-cash components of earnings derived from above and below market rent amortization and straight-line rents.


• | Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is defined as Operating EBITDAre divided by the sum of the gross interest and scheduled mortgage principal paid to our lenders plus dividends paid to our preferred stockholders.


• | Net Operating Income ("NOI") is the sum of base rent, percentage rent, and recoveries from tenants and other income, less operating and maintenance, real estate taxes, ground rent, and provision for doubtful accounts. NOI excludes straight-line rental income and expense, above and below market rent and ground rent amortization, tenant lease inducement amortization, and other fees. The Company also provides disclosure of NOI excluding termination fees, which excludes both termination fee income and expenses. 


• | NAREIT Funds from Operations ("NAREIT FFO") is a commonly used measure of REIT performance, which NAREIT defines as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains and losses from sales of depreciable property, net of tax, excluding operating real estate impairments, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. We compute NAREIT FFO for all periods presented in accordance with NAREIT's definition. Many companies use different depreciable lives and methods, and real estate values historically fluctuate with market conditions. Since NAREIT FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from depreciable property dispositions, and impairments, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, acquisition and development activities, and financing costs. This provides a perspective of our financial performance not immediately apparent from net income determined in accordance with GAAP. Thus, NAREIT FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of our operating performance, which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP; and, therefore, should not be considered a substitute measure of cash flows from operations. The Company provides a reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Stockholders to NAREIT FFO.
