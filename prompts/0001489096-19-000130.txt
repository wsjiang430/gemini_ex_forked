ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview
We are one of the largest providers of highly engineered industrial process heating solutions for process industries. For over 60 years, we have served a diverse base of thousands of customers around the world in attractive and growing markets, including oil & gas, chemical processing and power generation. We are a global leader and one of the few thermal solutions providers with a global footprint. We offer a full suite of products (heating units, heating cables, tubing bundles and control systems) and services (design optimization, engineering, installation and maintenance services) required to deliver comprehensive solutions to complex projects. We serve our customers through a global network of sales and service professionals and distributors in more than 30 countries and through our ten manufacturing facilities on three continents. These global capabilities and longstanding relationships with some of the largest multinational oil & gas, chemical processing, power and engineering, procurement and construction ("EPC") companies in the world have enabled us to diversify our revenue streams and opportunistically access high growth markets worldwide. For fiscal 2019, approximately 60% of our revenue was generated outside of the United States. 
During fiscal years 2015 and 2016, we acquired three companies, Unitemp Corporation ("Unitemp"), Sumac Fabrication Company Limited ("Sumac") and Industrial Process Insulators, Inc. ("IPI"), adding complementary products and services to our core thermal solution offerings. Additionally, in October 2017, we completed the acquisition of CCI Thermal Technologies Inc., now Thermon Heating Systems, Inc. ("THS"), allowing Thermon to greatly expand our product offerings and the end markets we serve. We continue to actively pursue both organic and inorganic growth initiatives that serve to advance our corporate strategy.
Our legacy thermal solutions product - also referred to as heat tracing - provides an external heat source to pipes, vessels and instruments for the purposes of freeze protection, temperature and flow maintenance, environmental monitoring, and surface snow and ice melting. We offer both electric and steam heat tracing, as both are utilized to a significant extent in our end markets. Customers typically purchase our products when constructing a new facility, which we refer to as "Greenfield projects", or when performing maintenance, repair and operations on a facility's existing heat-traced pipes or upgrading or expanding a current facility, which we refer to collectively as "MRO/UE." A large processing facility may require our heat tracing for a majority of its pipes, with the largest facilities containing hundreds of thousands of feet of heat-tracing cable and thousands of control points. While our products represent a fraction of the total cost of a typical processing facility, they are critical to the safe and profitable operation of the facility. These facilities are complex, with numerous classified areas that are inherently hazardous - and where product safety concerns are paramount. We believe that our strong brand and established reputation for safety, reliability and customer service are critical contributors to our customers' purchasing decisions.
Our customers' need for MRO/UE solutions provides us with attractive recurring revenue streams. Customers typically use the incumbent heat tracing provider for MRO/UE projects to avoid complications and compatibility problems associated with switching providers. We typically begin to realize meaningful MRO/UE revenue from new Greenfield installations one to three years after completion of the project as customers begin to remove and replace our products during routine and preventative maintenance on in-line mechanical equipment, such as pipes and valves. As a result, our growth has been driven by new facility construction, as well as by servicing our continually growing base of solutions installed around the world, which we refer to as our installed base. Approximately 51% of our revenue for fiscal 2019, excluding THS, was derived from such MRO/UE activities. 
In April 2015, we expanded our product offerings beyond our legacy heat tracing products and now offer temporary electrical power distribution products through our Sumac product line. Sumac products are sold in many of the same markets as our thermal solution offerings, which we believe will provide an attractive complementary offering to our customers that engage in new facility construction as well as maintenance, turnaround and expansion activities.

Our newest offerings - made possible through the acquisition of THS - give us the ability to access a much broader footprint of a typical refining or heavy manufacturing facility where our legacy products have generally been required. With our full suite of heating products, we can now extend beyond the external heating of pipes offered by heat tracing. Our family of environmental heating products (branded as “Ruffneck” and “Catadyne”) range from electric or gas-powered space heating for personnel operating in harsh and hazardous environments to specific components in the same environments that need special protection. THS also offers a broad spectrum of capabilities in the process heating line. Immersion, circulation, and other highly-engineered forms of process heating (branded as “Caloritech”) protects process fluids as they reside in tanks or vessels or in-transit through the plant. One can think of our legacy capabilities as heating “from the outside,” whereas our additional capabilities provide us the products to heat “from within.” THS holds an “N-stamp,” or Nuclear Component Certification, allowing us to serve the nuclear power sector with heating and filtration products. These highly specialized filters use advanced mediums and specialized metals to perform under extreme heat and pressure. These products are branded as “3L Filters.” Lastly, our “Fastrax” and “Hellfire” lines, as well as some “Caloritech” products, provide a full-spectrum offering to the rail and transit industry. In both rolling stock and rail infrastructure, THS is a market leader in providing heat to rail cars, tracks, and switches throughout the world.

Company History
Thermon, Inc., our principal operating subsidiary in the United States, was founded as a partnership in October 1954 and later incorporated in Texas in 1960. At that time, our primary product was a thermally conductive heat transfer compound invented by our founder, Richard Burdick. Under Mr. Burdick's leadership, we experienced steady growth by diversifying our products and expanding our geographic reach. Mr. Burdick and his family maintained a controlling interest in us until August 2007, when the controlling interest was sold to an affiliate of the Audax Group private equity firm. During Audax's tenure as our majority owner, we positioned ourselves to take advantage of rising demand in the energy end market and secured significant capital projects. 
On April 30, 2010, an investor group led by entities affiliated with CHS Capital LLC and two other private equity firms, which we refer to collectively as our "former private equity sponsors", acquired Audax's controlling interest in us. The acquisition and related transaction expenses were financed through the issuance of senior secured notes and an equity investment by our former private equity sponsors and certain members of our current and former management team. As used in this annual report, the "CHS Transactions" refer collectively to such acquisition, the equity investment in us by CHS, our other former private equity sponsors and certain members of our management team and related financing transactions.
In May 2011, we completed the initial public offering of our common stock (or "IPO"), and our common stock became listed on The New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "THR." Our former private equity sponsors sold shares of our common stock in both the IPO and a secondary public offering in September 2012. As of March 31, 2013, our former private equity sponsors had sold or otherwise disposed of all of their shares of common stock in the Company.
On March 2, 2015, we acquired substantially all of the operating assets and assumed certain operating liabilities of Unitemp located in Cape Town, South Africa in a $3.9 million cash transaction. Unitemp, formerly a distributor of Thermon's thermal solutions in South Africa, offers heating, sensing, portable instruments, monitoring and control solutions to industrial customers throughout Sub-Saharan Africa. On April 1, 2015, we acquired a 75% controlling interest in the business previously operated by Sumac for approximately $11.0 million in cash and up to $5.9 million of potential additional contingent cash consideration, which was settled for $5.8 million in fiscal 2017. Sumac is based in Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada and designs and manufactures temporary electrical power distribution equipment that is used in hazardous-location and general purpose areas within industrial facilities. On July 31, 2015, we acquired 100% of the capital stock of IPI, an insulation contractor located in Port Neches, Texas serving the U.S. refining, petrochemical, power and energy, marine and pulp and paper industries, in a $21.8 million cash transaction. IPI has a significant presence in the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast region.

In October 2017, we, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, acquired 100% of the equity interests of CCI Thermal Technologies Inc. and certain related real estate assets for $262.4 million CAD (approximately $204.6 million USD at the exchange rate as of October 30, 2017) in cash. Such subsidiary and CCI Thermal Technologies Inc. amalgamated immediately after the closing of the acquisition to form Thermon Heating Systems, Inc., an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. THS is engaged in industrial process heating, focused on the development and production of advanced heating and filtration solutions for industrial and hazardous area applications and is headquartered in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. THS markets its products through several diverse brands known for high quality, safety and reliability, and serves clients in the energy, petrochemical, electrical distribution, power, transit and industrial end markets globally. We believe we will be able to leverage our existing global sales force to further expand the reach of THS's product offerings.
Industry Overview
We estimate that the market for industrial process heating design and parts was approximately $4.0 billion in annual revenue in 2018. With our October 2017 acquisition of THS, our addressable market in fiscal 2018 grew by almost $1.0 billion in annual revenue, consisting of the process heating ($800 million) and transportation ($180 million) industries. This diversified the product and service mix to encompass the industrial process heating industry, which includes industrial heat tracing. We estimate that the industrial heat tracing market is composed of approximately 60% electric heat tracing and 40% steam heat tracing. While some environments welcome a conversion to electric heat tracing, a significant number of applications will remain protected by steam - due to both safety and the fact that many processes generate steam as a by-product, making it readily available. The industrial electric heat tracing industry is fragmented and consists of more than 30 companies that typically only serve discrete local markets with manufactured products and provide a limited service offering. The market for steam heat tracing solutions is equally as fragmented, but served by fewer companies, as the applications can be extremely high-temperature - requiring specific domain knowledge and manufacturing and installation techniques that are unique. Much like electric and steam heat tracing, the process heating market is highly fragmented. Industrial process heating providers differentiate themselves through the quality and reputation of their products, the length and quality of their customer relationships and their ability to provide comprehensive solutions. Large multinational companies drive the majority of spending for the types of major industrial facilities that require process heating, and we believe that they prefer providers who have a global footprint and a comprehensive suite of products and services. We believe we are one of only a few companies that meet these criteria.
The major end markets that drive demand for process heating include oil & gas, chemical processing and power generation. We believe that there are attractive near-to medium-term trends in each of these end markets. 

· | Oil & Gas. Process heating is used to facilitate the processing, transportation and freeze protection of energy products in both upstream and downstream oil and gas applications. According to the International Energy Agency ("IEA"), natural gas supplies 22% of the energy used worldwide, and makes up nearly a quarter of electricity generation, and plays a crucial role as a feedstock for industry. Also, IEA estimates that global oil and gas upstream capital spending will increase over 4% in 2019. The oil and gas end market accounted for approximately 38% of the total market for industrial process heating in 2019, or approximately $1.5 billion in revenue. As global oil prices continue to recover from the recent depression, Thermon is well-positioned to take advantage of the near-to medium-term growth trends associated with this primary end market. 


· | Chemical Processing. Process heating is required for temperature maintenance and freeze protection in a variety of chemical processing applications. Factors that may impact process heating demand in chemicals end markets include the rapid industrialization of the developing world, a shift in base chemical processing operations to low-cost feedstock regions, a transition of Western chemical processing activities from commodity products to specialty products and environmental compliance. The IEA estimates that new global petrochemicals capacity will account for 33% of oil-demand growth by 2030. We estimate that the chemicals end market (including petrochemical) accounted for approximately 14% of the total market for industrial process heating in 2019, or approximately $560 million in revenue.


· | Power Generation. Process heating is required for high-temperature product maintenance, freeze protection and environmental regulation compliance in coal and gas facilities and for safety systems in nuclear facilities. An important driver of demand for process heating solutions for power generation is increasing demand for electricity worldwide. We estimate that the power generation end market accounted for approximately 7% of the total market for industrial process heating in fiscal 2019, or approximately $280 million in revenue. According to the IEA's World Energy Outlook 2018, electricity currently accounts for 19% of final energy consumption, a share that is expected to increase as demand growth for electricity outpaces all other fuels. According to the IEA's World

3

Energy Outlook 2018's New Policies Scenario, electricity will account for 24% of final energy consumption in 2040.

· | Transportation. Process heating is required to safely clear and heat rail switches, melt snow and ice from platforms, and provide comfort heating and defrosting in rolling stock. With over 1.1 million kilometers of operational railway in the world, it is still one of the most economical and safe solutions for passengers and products globally. According to an estimate by IEA based on International Union of Railways ("UIC"), Urban, passenger and freight rail continues to grow on the same curve as global gross domestic product, or GDP. Of this growth, the commercial rail and transit sector represents the largest increase at approximately 8.9% through 2028. We estimate that our transportation industry end markets accounted for approximately 6% of the total market for industrial process heating in fiscal 2019, or approximately $240 million in revenue.

Segments
We operate in four reportable segments based on four geographic countries or regions in which we operate: (i) United States and Latin America ("US-LAM"), (ii) Canada, (iii) Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") and (iv) Asia-Pacific ("APAC"). Within our four reportable segments, our core products and services are focused on thermal solutions primarily related to the electrical heat tracing industry. Each of our reportable segments serves a similar class of customers, including engineering, procurement and construction companies, international and regional oil and gas companies, commercial sub-contractors, electrical component distributors and direct sales to existing plant or industrial applications. Profitability within our segments is measured by operating income. Profitability can vary in each of our reportable segments based on the competitive environment within the region, the level of corporate overhead, such as the salaries of our senior executives, and the level of research and development and marketing activities in the region, as well as the mix of products and services. Since March 2015, we acquired THS, Unitemp, IPI and Sumac. THS (formerly known as CCI Thermal Technologies Inc.) develops and produces advanced industrial heating and filtration solutions for industrial and hazardous area applications that closely align with Thermon's core business and serves similar end markets in North America. As such, we have elected to report THS's operations through our US-LAM and Canada reportable segments. Both Unitemp and IPI offer thermal solutions and have been included in our EMEA and US-LAM reportable segments, respectively. Sumac provides temporary power products that differ from our core thermal solutions business. As operating results from Sumac comprise less than 10% of our total sales and operating income, Sumac has been aggregated in our Canada segment. See Note 18, "Segment Information" for financial data relating to our four reportable geographic segments.

Electric Heat Tracing Applications
We manufacture critical components of an electric heat tracing system, including heating cables, control and monitoring systems and heating systems for tanks and hoppers. We customize these products to fit the specific design parameters for each client's installation. We offer various electric heating cables, including conductive polymer self-regulating heating cables, power limiting cables, constant wattage heating cables and MI high temperature heating cables.
Self-regulating heating cables- Our self-regulating heating cables are flexible and engineered to automatically increase or decrease heat output as pipe or vessel temperature changes. BSX™ self-regulating cables are designed to provide freeze protection or process temperature maintenance to metallic and non-metallic piping, vessels and equipment. HTSX™ self-regulating heating cable is suitable for heat tracing applications involving crude oil and most chemicals. 
Power-limiting and constant watt heating cables- Power limiting and constant watt heating cables are flexible parallel resistance cables used to heat trace piping in lengths longer than 500 feet. Such intermediate lengths of pipe are commonly found in pipe racks that connect process units within a plant. These heaters allow longer lengths between power supply points than self-regulating cables. HPT cables offer a power limiting feature along with larger power bus wires to allow delivery of an increased heat output over that found with self-regulating cables.
TEK™ HTEK™ and MIQ™ cables- The TEK™ and HTEK™ series resistance, constant watt heating cables are used where circuit lengths exceed the limitations of parallel resistance heating cables. By using series constant watt heating cables, a single power supply point can energize circuit lengths up to 12,000 feet. MIQ™ high performance mineral insulated heating cables are used for high temperature maintenance, high temperature exposure and/or high watt density applications that exceed the limitations of thermoplastic insulated cables. MIQ™ cables are composed of a high nickel/chromium alloy sheath, which is well-suited for high temperature service and offers high resistance to stress corrosion in chloride, acid, salt and alkaline environments.
ThermTracTM cables - A ThermTrac skin effect system provides a cost-effective alternative to conventional resistance heat tracing on long pipelines by eliminating the need for an extensive power distribution system. A ThermTrac system is designed to heat a pipeline in excess of 15 miles long from a single power point. The versatility of the system makes it well-suited for temperature maintenance, freeze protection and heat-up applications. The system generates heat by the resistance of the electrical current flowing through both the conductor and the inner skin of a heat tube.
Steam Heating Solutions
In 1954, we began manufacturing heat transfer compounds that greatly improved the heat delivery of steam tracing systems. Today, in addition to the broad range of heat transfer compounds, we also offer steam tracers and tubing bundles that provide our customers with comprehensive steam tracing solutions. We manufacture our heat transfer compounds in various configurations so that they can be applied to different surfaces, which increases the heat transfer rate of steam or fluid tracers.
Our heat transfer compounds create an efficient thermal connection between the heat tracing system and the process equipment. Through the elimination of air voids, heat is directed into the pipe wall primarily through conduction rather than convection and radiation. This requires fewer tracing pipes to maintain specified temperature requirements, substantially reducing operating and investment cost. Steam tracing offers the most cost effective solution for certain heavy oil and natural gas processing applications. We have also patented our SafeTrace® steam tracing products for use in applications with stringent temperature requirements.
Currently, we are adding capabilities to include full steam heating solutions. This includes the design, engineering, procurement, integration, installation, and insulation of steam systems that include the steam supply manifold, the condensate return manifold, and the tubing, valves, fittings, heat trace, and other components that exist in-between.

Temperature Controls and Monitoring
We supply a wide range of control and monitoring products, from simple mechanical thermostats to sophisticated microprocessor-based systems that control and monitor the status of electric heat tracing systems. We provide individual units for smaller projects, as well as multi-point controllers that can be integrated into and communicate with a plant's central data management and control system.
We offer a variety of temperature control monitoring systems as part of our TraceNet™ family of controller solutions. TraceNet™ controllers allow operators to assess control parameters, set control algorithms and monitor operating conditions throughout heat tracing installations. In conjunction with our TraceNet™ monitoring software, over 30,000 heat trace circuits can be monitored within the same network. We actively seek to expand our TraceNet™ product offerings with smart, connected solutions delivering customers the most advanced, reliable and easy-to-use monitoring solutions in the marketplace.
Instrumentation
We specialize in pre-insulated and heat-traced tubing bundles with accessories that offer a complete instrument heating system. Our complete range of products includes both electric- and steam-heated bundles containing various types of tubing (such as copper, stainless steel and polymer) to meet the needs of process and environmental applications. Such applications include transporting samples of gas or liquid in our customized, temperature-controlled tubing bundles to an instrument that typically performs an analysis for purposes of process management or ensuring compliance with internal requirements or applicable environmental laws and regulations.
Project Services
As a manufacturer and global expert in process heating solutions, our customers often times rely on Thermon to deliver a range of project services, which may include:
•Engineering and design
•Procurement and project management services
•Turnkey installation
•Recurring facility assessment or audit
•Maintenance services
Our customers rely on Thermon’s design and engineering expertise on projects around the world. These services are combined with our heat tracing and process heating products under one contract to deliver an integrated solution that improves the overall value proposition for the customer. By delivering design drawings in conjunction with early project specifications, we can address our customer needs for design optimization studies, product selection assistance and computer-generated drawing packages. Often these are new facilities or Greenfield projects but they may also include upgrades or expansions and maintenance projects where our existing customers are upgrading their facilities. Project services are important to our business model and growth strategy to secure Greenfield contracts that both establish and enhance new and existing customer relationships.
Project services also include full turnkey solutions whereby we contract to install a complete heat tracing or process heating solution. We refer to this as our construction business which is primarily located in the southern United States near many of our customers in the downstream and mid stream petroleum, chemical and power generation industries.
Thermon Heating Systems Products
In October 2017, we acquired 100% of the equity of CCI Thermal Technologies Inc. and immediately rebranded as Thermon Heating Systems, Inc. ("THS"). THS develops, designs and manufactures the following high quality and durable advanced industrial heating and filtration solutions: 

• | Environmental heating (branded as“Ruffneck” and “Catadyne”) - which provides electric or gas-powered space heating for both hazardous and non-hazardous areas;


• | Process heating (branded as “Caloritech”) - provides a myriad of highly-engineered heating products to multiple end-markets with the purpose of heating and maintaining a process fluid at specified temperatures. Some products also serve the transportation sector with both radiant and convection-style heating;

• | Filtration (branded as “3L Filters”) - which provides highly-specialized filtration solutions for the most stringent environments, including the nuclear industry; and


• | Transportation (branded as “Fastrax” and “Hellfire”) - provides heating applications to both rolling stock (rail cars) and rail infrastructure (track and switch).

Sumac Temporary Power Products
In April 2015, we acquired a 75% controlling interest in the business previously operated by Sumac. Sumac's line of products and solutions are designed to provide a safe and efficient means of supplying temporary electrical power distribution and lighting at energy infrastructure facilities for new construction and during maintenance and turnaround projects at operating facilities. Sumac products include power distribution panels, master/slave sub-panels, power cords and lighting fixtures - and are sold to end-users operating in many of the same markets as our core thermal solutions, including heavy industrial settings, oil and gas refining and upgrading, power generation plants, petrochemical production facilities and mining operations. A number of these products are engineered-to-order based on proprietary designs. 
Sumac's products are designed around the "plug and play" concept and differentiated from others in the industry through unique safety features that include arc flash protection i.e., protecting users while making and breaking connections under electrical load, and offering ground fault protection. Certain products are certified to safely operate in hazardous areas such as live plant environments that process combustible chemicals and materials. Sumac's suite of products is designed to allow for quick reconfigurations of electrical power distribution panels to meet the changing needs of contractors as work moves from one phase to the next during construction and facility maintenance operations. These features help our customers save considerable time on the job site and realize significant cost savings while maintaining the highest level of safety. We believe we will be able to leverage our existing global sales force to further expand the reach of Sumac's product offerings.
Manufacturing and Operations
We have ten manufacturing facilities on three continents. We manufacture the products that generate a majority of our total sales at our principal facility in San Marcos, Texas including flexible heating cables, heat tracing compound and tubing bundles. Our facilities are highly automated, which reduces labor costs. Our facilities incorporate numerous manufacturing processes that utilize computer-controlled equipment and laser technology. We maintain a ready supply of spare parts and have on-site personnel trained to repair and perform preventative maintenance on our specialized equipment, reducing the likelihood of long term interruptions at our manufacturing facilities. Our manufacturing facilities are equipped to provide us with maximum flexibility to manufacture our products efficiently and with short lead times. This in turn allows for lower inventory levels and faster responses to customer demands.
Our flexible heat cable products are manufactured in San Marcos, Texas. The manufacturing building has approximately 48,000 square feet of floor space, including offices. The facility has excess capacity and will support growth of our primary heat cable sales to an aggregate revenue capacity of $400 to $500 million, depending on pricing and product mix. 
Our electronic cross-linking facility, which we refer to as our "ECLF," is also located at the San Marcos facility. Cross-linking enhances the thermal, chemical and electrical stability of our low-temperature self-regulating heater cables. By performing cross-linking in-house, we condense the overall manufacturing cycle by approximately six weeks. This enhances our ability to ensure a high level of product quality and to better control the production process. 
Our pre-insulated tubing products are manufactured in our facilities in San Marcos and the Netherlands. The majority of our pre-insulated tubing product is custom ordered and made to customers' specifications in a two-part process. The thermal insulation is first applied over the heating cable and process tubing, and a protective plastic outer jacket is extruded onto the bundle to protect the insulation. 
During fiscal 2016, we completed an expansion of our primary pre-insulated tubing product manufacturing plant located in San Marcos, Texas, which significantly increased our production capacity for our instrumentation tube-bundle product line. The total cost of the expanded facility, including the purchase of new capital equipment, was $3.5 million. 
Our MI cable manufacturing facility in Edmonton, Canada gives us adequate capacity to service the demands of clients in the oil sands projects of Western Canada in a time efficient manner. The facility's strategic location has enabled us to expand our sale of MI cable, which is well-suited for high temperature applications and harsh, arctic environments, into a global business.

THS products are currently fabricated at five THS facilities in North America: Edmonton, Oakville, and Orillia in Canada, and Denver and Houston in the United States. THS maintains state of the art facilities and maintains several recognized facility certifications. 
Sumac's products are currently fabricated at a facility in Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada. Sumac's customer base has primarily been in the oil sands region of Alberta, Canada, which is a remote location. We are in the process of expanding Sumac's temporary power solution presence in the U.S. gulf-coast region with the addition of fabrication capacity at our San Marcos, Texas facility.
In 2017, we completed construction of our newest manufacturing facility in Russia, Thermon Eurasia LLC, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary has begun local production of key products in the greater Moscow region. The new production facility, approximately 20,300 square feet, focuses on manufacturing, fabrication, packaging and quality control of high-temperature self-regulating heating cables, low-temperature self-regulation heating cables, series constant watt cables, mineral insulated heating circuits, power and splice boxes, mechanical thermostats, electronic control modules, heat tracing kits and accessories, control panels and power distribution boards. The facility has helped us better serve our customers in the region through a comprehensive local suite of heat tracing products and services, including sales support, logistics, engineering, technical support, project management, and field services for electric and steam heat tracing, as well as other industrial process heating applications. We believe Russia and the adjacent Eurasian countries represent a very important and promising market opportunity for Thermon, and the new production facility is a key strategic investment. Our capital investment for the new facility was $1.0 million.
We maintain quality control testing standards in all of our manufacturing operations and perform various quality control checks on our products during the manufacturing process. We believe that our highly automated manufacturing process and multiple quality control checkpoints create high levels of operational efficiency.
Purchasing Strategy- Our critical raw materials include polymers, graphite, copper and stainless steel. For most of these materials, we purchase from multiple suppliers in order to avoid any potential disruption of our manufacturing process. For a small number of raw material items that require specific quality specifications, we have single source supply arrangements. We manage the inherent supply risk through purchase contracts and the maintenance of increased safety stock levels at all times. We evaluate pricing and performance of all suppliers annually. For our low-volume custom-built electronic controller components, we select a single supplier based on past performance reliability and monitor the process closely as volumes are too low to divide this product over multiple suppliers. Our purchase specifications are usually based on industry or manufacturer standards. Testing of the raw materials is performed and documented by our suppliers and is reviewed by us at the time of receipt.
Distribution- Our primary distribution centers are located in San Marcos, Texas, Calgary, Alberta and the Netherlands. Inventory is typically shipped directly from these distribution centers to customers, the construction site or our regional sales agents or distributors. Our sales agents may maintain "safety stocks" of core products to service the immediate MRO/UE requirements of customers who are time-sensitive and cannot wait for delivery from one of the central distribution centers. In the United States, a network of agents maintains safety stocks of core products. In Canada, customers are serviced from the central distribution center in Calgary. THS maintains a sufficient supply of inventoried catalog stores at all five THS locations to quickly service customers' needs. Highly customizable engineered products are primarily manufactured out of the Oakville, Canada location. In Europe, customers are serviced from the central distribution center in the Netherlands. In Asia, safety stock of materials are kept in Yokohama, Japan; Seoul, Korea; Shanghai, China; Pune, India; and Melbourne, Australia. Safety stocks are also warehoused in Moscow, Russia, Mexico City and Mexico. We expect to utilize warehouses that have been added through the acquisition of Sumac, IPI and Unitemp in Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada, Port Neches, Texas and Cape Town and Johannesburg, South Africa, respectively, to store inventory for sales to existing Sumac, IPI and Unitemp customers. 
In April 2015, we completed the expansion of our primary distribution center located in San Marcos, Texas at a total cost of $3.9 million including equipment. The expansion has significantly increased our storage capacity, reduced outside storage costs and consolidated warehouse operations for improved efficiencies.
Customers
We serve a broad base of large multinational customers, many of which we have served for more than 60 years. We have a diversified revenue mix with thousands of customers. None of our customers represented more than 10% of total revenue in fiscal 2019.

Sales and Marketing
Our direct sales force is focused on positioning us with major end-users and EPC companies during the development phase of Greenfield projects with the goal of providing reliable, cost-effective process heating solutions. We utilize a network of more than 100 independent sales agents and distributors in over 30 countries to provide local support to customer facilities for MRO/UE. We actively participate in the growth and development of the domestic and international electrical standards established in the countries in which we sell products. We believe that we have established credibility as a reliable provider of high quality process heating products. In addition, we believe that our registered trademarks in the United States and numerous additional brand names are recognized globally, giving us excellent brand recognition.
Standards and Certifications-We continually test our products to demonstrate that they can withstand harsh operating environments. Our products and associated design practices are subjected to various tests, including heat output, thermal stability and long-term aging, with the goal of producing products capable of performing at or beyond the expectations of our customers. All products are further tested and certified by various approval agencies to verify compliance with applicable industry standards.
We evaluate our products for electrical safety requirements, environmental assessments and market based assessments for the particular applications and harsh climates that Thermon services. Our products comply with national and international heat tracing industry standards such as ANSI/IEEE-515, ANSI/IEEE, 515.1, ANSI/IEEE-844, UL 508A, UL 698, UL 1030 and UL 499 in the United States, Canadian Standards Association 130.03, 72, 46, 88, 14 and 30 in Canada; and International Electrical Commission IECx 60079-30-1, IECEx 60079-30-2, IECEx 60079-0, IECEx 60079-1 and IECEx 60079-2 in international markets. We also hold many product certifications from local country approval agencies and registration bodies around the world. We actively monitor the introduction of new domestic or global standards and certifications, and pursue certifications relating to the electrical heat tracing industry. 
Competition
The global industrial electric heat tracing industry is fragmented and consists of more than 30 companies, which typically only serve discrete local markets and provide a limited service offering. We believe that we are the second largest participant in the industrial electric heat tracing market and one of only a few solutions providers with a comprehensive suite of products and services, global capabilities and local on-site presence. Our most significant competitor is nVent Electric plc (NYSE: NVT), which was spun-off of Pentair plc (NYSE:PNR) in April 2018.
We have entered the broader industrial process heating market following the THS transaction in October 2017. The industrial process heating market, which includes industrial heat tracing, also tends to be fairly fragmented with several smaller companies serving discrete local markets with limited offerings. The primary competitors of THS vary by end-market, but generally we view nVent Electric, NIBE, Watlow and Chromalox as competitors in various areas across the spectrum of end-markets we now serve.
Industrial process heating providers differentiate themselves through value-added services, long-term customer relationship management and the ability to provide a full range of solutions. We differentiate ourselves from local providers by a global footprint, a full suite of products and services and a track record with some of the largest multinational energy, chemical processing, power and EPC companies in the world. In addition, we are almost entirely dedicated to providing thermal solutions and complementary products and services whereas some of our competitors' thermal solutions operations constitute only one of numerous operating segments.
Intellectual Property and Technology
The industrial process heating industry, as well as the complementary markets where we intend to expand, are highly competitive and subject to the introduction of innovative techniques and services using new technologies. While we have patented some of our products and processes, we historically have not relied upon patents to protect our design, manufacturing processes or products, and our patents are not material to our operations or business. Instead, we rely significantly on maintaining the confidentiality of our trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, other proprietary rights and other information related to our operations. Accordingly, we require all employees to sign a nondisclosure agreement to protect our trade secrets, business strategy and other proprietary information. We rely on registered and unregistered trademarks in the United States and abroad and have many recognized brand names.

Research and Development
Our research and development activities are focused on identifying new technologies to enhance our industrial process heating solutions through identifying opportunities to maximize product reliability and reduce the customer's total cost of ownership, which consists of capital expenses, maintenance costs and energy costs. Current product development initiatives include polymer research and continued advancement of integrated control and monitoring systems. Software development activities include advanced heat tracing network monitoring communication software and engineering design software initiatives.
Employees
As of March 31, 2019, we employed approximately 1,465 persons on a full-time basis worldwide and retained approximately 228 independent contractors. We have never experienced any organized work stoppage or strike; however, approximately 1% of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our employee relations to be good.
Governmental Regulation
Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to complex United States and foreign laws governing, among others, anti-corruption matters, export controls, economic sanctions, antiboycott rules, currency exchange controls and transfer pricing rules. These laws are administered, among others, the U.S. Department of Justice, the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service, or the "IRS," Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, or "BIS," the Office of Antiboycott Compliance, or "OAC," and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or "OFAC," as well as the counterparts of these agencies in foreign countries. Our policies mandate compliance with these laws. Despite our training and compliance programs, no assurances can be made that we will be found to be operating in full compliance with, or be able to detect every violation of, any such laws. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.
Environmental Compliance
Our operations and properties are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air or water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances or wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites, the emission of greenhouse gases, and workplace health and safety. Certain environmental laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs, without regard to fault, on persons who have disposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment. In addition, we could become liable to third parties for damages resulting from the disposal or release of hazardous substances into the environment. Some of our sites are affected by soil and groundwater contamination relating to historical site operations, which could require us to incur expenses to investigate and remediate the contamination in compliance with environmental laws. Some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution, and these permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation by issuing authorities. A failure to obtain, maintain, and comply with these permit requirements could result in substantial penalties, including facility shutdowns. From time to time, we could be subject to requests for information, notices of violation, and/or investigations initiated by environmental regulatory agencies relating to our operations and properties. Violations of environmental and health and safety laws can result in substantial penalties, civil and criminal sanctions, permit revocations, and facility shutdowns. Environmental and health and safety laws may change rapidly and have tended to become more stringent over time. As a result, we could incur costs for past, present, or future failure to comply with all environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. In addition, we could become subject to potential regulations concerning the emission of greenhouse gasses, and while the effect of such future regulations cannot be determined at this time, they could require us to incur substantial costs in order to achieve and maintain compliance. In the ordinary course of business, we may be held responsible for any environmental damages we may cause to our customers' premises.
