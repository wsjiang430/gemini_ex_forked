ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
Lisata Therapeutics, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “we,” “us,” “our,” “Lisata” or the “Company”) is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative therapies for the treatment of solid tumors and other major diseases. Our lead investigational product candidate, LSTA1 (formerly known as CEND-1), is designed to activate a novel uptake pathway that allows co-administered or tethered anti-cancer drugs to penetrate solid tumors more effectively. LSTA1 actuates this active transport system in a tumor-specific manner, resulting in systemically co-administered anti-cancer drugs more efficiently penetrating and accumulating in the tumor, while normal tissues are not affected. LSTA1 also has the potential to modify the tumor microenvironment (“TME”), with the objective of making tumors more susceptible to immunotherapies. We and our collaborators have amassed significant non-clinical data demonstrating enhanced delivery of a range of emerging anti-cancer therapies, including immunotherapies and RNA-based therapeutics. To date, LSTA1 has also demonstrated favorable safety, tolerability, and activity in completed and ongoing clinical trials designed to enhance delivery of standard-of-care chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer. We are exploring the potential of LSTA1 to enable a variety of treatment modalities to treat a range of solid tumors more effectively. In addition, we have clinical development programs based on our autologous CD34+ cell therapy technology platform that are advancing toward their next development milestone while incurring no capital outlay.
Our leadership team has decades of collective biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical product development experience across a variety of therapeutic categories and at all stages of development from preclinical through to product registration and launch. Our goal is to develop and commercialize products that address important unmet medical needs based on a broad and versatile portfolio of candidates. Our current development pipeline includes: 
•LSTA1, the subject of Phase 1b/2a and 2b clinical studies being conducted globally in a variety of solid tumor types, including metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (mPDAC), in combination with a variety of anti-cancer regimens;
•HONEDRA® (LSTA12, formerly CLBS12), recipient of SAKIGAKE designation, pursuant to which early conditional approval in Japan for the treatment of critical limb ischemia (“CLI”) and Buerger’s disease is being sought based on the current results of a clinical trial executed in Japan. HONEDRA® was the recipient of orphan drug designation in March 2021 from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for Buerger's disease; and
•LSTA201 (formerly, CLBS201), the subject of a recently completed study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of CD34+ cell therapy as a regenerative treatment for patients with chronic kidney disease related to type 2 diabetes (diabetic kidney disease or “DKD”).

Merger with Cend Therapeutics, Inc. and Name Change
On September 15, 2022, we, then operating as Caladrius Biosciences, Inc. (“Caladrius"), completed our acquisition of Cend Therapeutics, Inc. (the “Merger”), in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”), dated as of April 26, 2022, by and among us, Cend Therapeutics, Inc. (“Cend”) and CS Cedar Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”).
Pursuant to the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement and effective September 15, 2022 (the “Effective Time”): (i) Merger Sub merged with and into Cend, with Cend surviving as our wholly owned subsidiary, (ii) we changed our name to Lisata Therapeutics, Inc., and (iii) we effected a 1:15 reverse stock split of our common stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”) prior to the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, each share of Cend's common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time was converted into the right to receive shares of our common stock, based on an exchange ratio of 0.5338, after taking into account the Reverse Stock Split (the “Exchange Ratio”). In connection with the Merger close, we issued an aggregate of 3,772,768 shares of common stock, based on the Exchange Ratio, to holders of Cend, in exchange for all of the Cend capital stock outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the Merger.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we assumed all of the outstanding and unexercised options to purchase shares of Cend capital stock under the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Cend Plan”), and, in connection with the Merger, such options were converted into options to purchase shares of our common stock based on the Exchange Ratio. At the closing of the Merger, we assumed Cend's stock options to purchase an aggregate of 1,227,776 shares of our common stock. 
Caladrius was considered to be the accounting acquirer based on the terms of the Merger Agreement and certain factors including: (i) Caladrius owned approximately 52% of our outstanding shares of common stock immediately following the close of the Merger; (ii) although both entities contributed to our new management team, the Caladrius team had more individuals on the management team and holds the chief executive officer (“CEO”), chief medical officer (“CMO”) and other senior management roles; (iii) Caladrius paid a premium to acquire Cend’s assets; and (iv) Caladrius was significantly larger than Cend regarding total assets, operations, and research and development activities. The Merger was accounted for as an asset acquisition as substantially all of the fair value is concentrated in in-process research and development (“IPR&D”). Cend’s assets (except for cash and working capital) were measured and recognized as an allocation of the transaction price based on their relative fair values as of the transaction date with any value associated with IPR&D with no alternative future use being expensed as reported in the consolidated statement of operations. The prior reported operating results prior to the closing of the Merger are those of Caladrius alone.
COVID-19 Considerations
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, was reported to have surfaced in China. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 to be a pandemic and the world's economies began to experience pronounced effects. Despite the FDA approval of multiple COVID-19 vaccines in late 2020, there remains uncertainty around the extent and duration of disruption and any future related financial impact cannot reasonably be estimated at this time. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented a universal work from home policy, which remains in effect, as well as stringent social distancing and other hygiene policies for employees when they are required in the office. As a result, we also reduced the size of leased space at our Basking Ridge headquarters thereby reducing leasing costs. Our clinical study of HONEDRA® in Japan experienced significant delays in enrollment due to the States of Emergency in effect in Japan for most of 2020, 2021 and 2022 covering Tokyo and other regions in response to an increased number of COVID-19 infections. With our expectation that COVID-19 in Japan would continue to negatively impact clinical site operations and enrollment of patients in the HONEDRA® clinical trial, we elected to suspend trial enrollment, seek a development partner and consult with the Japanese regulatory authorities regarding the submission of patient data already accrued. Lisata's' Phase 2b FREEDOM Trial of XOWNA® in the U.S. had also experienced delays in enrolling patients as a result of COVID-19. While early enrollment proceeded to plan with the first patient treated in January 2021, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a general slowing of enrollment, including supply chain disruptions affecting the availability of qualified catheters used in the diagnosis of CMD and/or administration of XOWNA® as well as with a contrast agent typically used in many catheter laboratories. In May 2022, we announced that enrollment in the FREEDOM Trial had been suspended and that we intended to conduct an interim analysis of the data from not less than the first 20 patients enrolled using the six-month follow-up data to evaluate the efficacy and safety of XOWNA® in subjects with CMD. Following this analysis along with Key Opinion Leaders’ input, we determined that execution of a redesigned FREEDOM-like trial would be the appropriate next step, but the cost of such a trial would be prohibitively expensive to undergo without a strategic partner. Accordingly, our board of directors concluded that XOWNA® development will only be continued if a strategic partner that can contribute the necessary capital for a redesigned trial is identified and secured. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify such a partner and enter into an agreement with such partner on acceptable terms or at all.
Reverse Stock Split
Index

On September 14, 2022, in connection with the Merger, we implemented the Reverse Stock Split, which was approved at our annual meeting of stockholders on September 13, 2022. The Reverse Stock Split became effective on September 14, 2022 at 5:00 pm and our common stock began trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market on a post-split basis at the open of business on September 15, 2022. As of September 14, 2022, every fifteen shares of our issued and outstanding common stock (and such shares held in treasury) were automatically converted into one share of common stock, without any change in the par value per share. In addition, proportionate adjustments were made to the per share exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of all outstanding stock options, stock appreciation rights, convertible notes and warrants to purchase shares of common stock, the number of shares issuable upon the vesting of all restricted stock awards, and the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance pursuant to the our equity incentive compensation plans. Any stockholder who would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of common stock created as a result of the Reverse Stock Split received a cash payment equal to the product of such resulting fractional interest in one share of common stock multiplied by the closing trading price of the common stock on September 15, 2022. The Reverse Stock Split was effectuated in order to increase the per share trading price of our common stock to satisfy the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market.
All share and per share amounts of common stock, options and warrants in the accompanying financial statements have been restated for all periods presented to give retroactive effect to the Reverse Stock Split. Accordingly, the consolidated statements of equity reflect the impact of the Reverse Stock Split by reclassifying from “common stock” to “additional paid-in capital” in an amount equal to the par value of the decreased shares resulting from the Reverse Stock Split. 
Development Programs
Targeted Solid Tumor Penetration via CendR Active Transport
Many solid tumor cancers, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (“PDAC”), are surrounded by dense fibrotic tissue, or stroma. This limits the efficacy of current chemotherapies for these cancers. Emerging immunotherapy treatments, including checkpoint inhibitors, adoptive cell therapies such as chimeric antigen receptor T (“CAR-T”) cells, as well as nucleic acid-based therapies, such as short interfering RNA (“siRNA”), antisense oligonucleotides (“ASO”), and messenger RNAs (“mRNAs”) also face challenges in penetrating solid tumors. Many tumors also exhibit an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (“TME”), which suppresses patients’ immune systems’ ability to fight their cancer and can limit effectiveness of immunotherapies and/or contribute to metastases. These factors negatively impact the ability of many therapeutic agents to effectively treat these cancers.
To address the tumor stroma’s role as a primary impediment to effective treatment, Lisata’s approach is to activate the C-end rule (“CendR”), or CendR system, a naturally occurring active transport system. Lisata’s lead investigational drug, LSTA1 (a specific internalizing R-G-D or iRGD peptide) activates this transport system in a tumor-specific manner (Sugahara, Science, 2010). This results in tumors selectively and more efficiently taking up systemically administered anticancer drugs as if they were nutrients. As a result, more drug accumulates in the tumor than would accumulate without LSTA1, while normal tissues are not affected. Moreover, the drugs penetrate tumor cells farther away from blood vessels with LSTA1 present than without. The overall result is enhanced anticancer activity without an increase in side effects. Anticancer drugs can be coupled/tethered or conjugated to LSTA1 or other CendR peptides in Lisata’s portfolio, but can be also co-administered with LSTA1. Lisata believes that the co-administration option is an advantage because it is not necessary to create a new chemical entity with its attendant development and regulatory hurdles, providing a potentially faster-to-clinic and potentially faster-to-market product opportunity for a range of solid tumor cancers and for co-administration with a range of therapies.
Clinical progress with other approaches to address delivery to highly fibrotic tumors, such as PEGylated hyaluronidase and hedgehog inhibitors, has been limited by toxicity and side effects. LSTA1 has demonstrated favorable safety/tolerability and activity in clinical trials to enhance delivery of standard-of-care chemotherapy for mPDAC. Lisata and its collaborators have also amassed non-clinical data demonstrating enhanced delivery of a range of emerging anticancer therapies, including immunotherapies, and RNA-based therapeutics. LSTA1’s cancer-targeted delivery may enable such emerging treatment modalities to potentially more effectively treat a range of solid tumors.
LSTA1 as a treatment for solid tumor cancers in combination with other anti-cancer agents
LSTA1 is an investigational drug that actuates the CendR active transport mechanism while also having the potential to modify the TME and make it less immunosuppressive. It is targeted to tumor vasculature, tumor cells and some intratumoral immunosuppressive cells by its affinity for alpha-v, beta-3 and beta-5 integrins that are upregulated on these cells. LSTA1 is a nine amino acid cyclic internalizing RGD (“iRGD”) peptide that, once bound to these integrins, is cleaved by proteases expressed in tumors to release a peptide fragment, called a CendR fragment, which binds to a second receptor, called neuropilin-1, to activate a novel uptake pathway that allows circulating moieties such as anticancer drugs to more selectively penetrate solid tumors. The ability of LSTA1 and iRGD peptides to modify the TME to enhance delivery and efficacy of co-
Index

administered drugs has been demonstrated in many preclinical models in a range of solid tumors with the results from Lisata, collaborators and research groups around the world having been the subject of over 200 scientific publications.
With regard to clinical development, LSTA1 is the subject of a completed Phase 1b clinical trial of 31 first-line metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients, of which 29 were evaluable. Results from the trial showed that the safety profile of the LSTA1 combination regimen was similar to standard of care (“SoC”) alone with LSTA1 being well-tolerated with no-dose limiting toxicities. An Objective Response Rate (“ORR”) of fifty nine percent was observed, including a rare complete response, which compares favorably to the twenty three percent ORR observed in the “MPACT” clinical trial that served as the basis for approval of nab-paclitaxel for use in combination with gemcitabine for the treatment of first line, metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. A Disease Control Rate (“DCR”); (partial and complete responses plus stable disease) of over seventy nine percent was observed in comparison to a DCR of forty eight percent observed in the MPACT trial. Reduction in the level of circulating tumor biomarker CA19-1 was observed in ninety six percent of patients versus sixty one percent in the MPACT trial. Importantly, median progression-free survival and median overall survival of nearly ten months and over thirteen months was observed, respectively, vs. less than six months and less than nine months, respectively, in the MPACT trial. These results have been published in The Lancet Gastroenterology and Hepatology (Dean, et al. 2022).
Additionally, LSTA1 is the subject of multiple ongoing and planned clinical trials being conducted globally in a variety of solid tumor types and in combination with several chemotherapy and immunotherapy anti-cancer regimens. The following diagram summarizes these studies.
Ischemic Repair (CD34+ Cell Technology)
The CD34+ cell was discovered as a result of the deliberate search for a cell capable of stimulating the development and/or repair of blood vessels. All tissues in the body maintain their function by replacing cells over time. In addition to the maintenance function, the body must also be capable of building new blood vessels after injury. A CD34+ cell is an endothelial progenitor cell that has the ability to stimulate new blood vessel formation at the level of the microvasculature. No other native cell discovered to date has demonstrated this same capability.
Our proprietary cell technology using autologous (a patient’s own naturally occurring) CD34+ cells has led to the development of therapeutic product candidates designed to address diseases and conditions caused by ischemia. Ischemia occurs when the supply of oxygenated blood to healthy tissue is restricted or reduced. Through the administration of CD34+ cells, we seek to promote the development and formation of new microvasculature and thereby increase blood flow to the impacted area. We believe that a number of conditions caused by underlying ischemic injury can be improved through our CD34+ cell technology, including, but not limited to, Buerger's disease, CLI, CMD, and DKD.

XOWNA® for Treatment of Coronary Microvascular Dysfunction
In 2017, with the assistance of a $1.9 million grant from the National Institutes of Health (Award Number R44HL135889), we initiated our program for XOWNA® for the treatment of CMD, a disease that afflicts as many as 1.6 million patients in the United States alone, with no current targeted treatment options. That study, the ESCaPE-CMD Trial, was a Phase 2a proof-of-concept, open label study that enrolled patients at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, CA. Those data showed a positive therapeutic effect with a statistically significant improvement in angina frequency, coronary flow reserve, Canadian Cardiovascular Society Angina Class and Seattle Angina Questionnaire scores, as well as an acceptable safety profile. The full data set from that study was presented at the SCAI 2020 Scientific Sessions Virtual Conference on May 14, 2020 by Dr. Timothy Henry, FACC, of the Christ Hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio.
In December 2020, we commenced enrollment in our Phase 2b FREEDOM Trial of XOWNA®, a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of intracoronary artery delivery of autologous CD34+ cells in subjects with Coronary Microvascular Dysfunction (CMD) and without obstructive coronary artery disease and was expected to complete enrollment in approximately 12 months. While early enrollment proceeded to plan with the first patient treated in January 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in insurmountable enrollment rate challenges and population heterogenicity. As a result, in May 2022, we announced that enrollment in the FREEDOM Trial had been suspended and that we intended to conduct an interim analysis of the data from not less than the first 20 patients enrolled using the 6-month follow-up data to evaluate the efficacy and safety of XOWNA® in subjects with CMD. Following this analysis, along with Key Opinion Leaders’ input, we determined that execution of a redesigned FREEDOM-like trial would be the appropriate next step, but the cost of such a trial would be prohibitively expensive to undergo without a strategic partner. Accordingly, our board of directors concluded that XOWNA® development will only be continued if a strategic partner that can contribute the necessary capital for a redesigned trial is identified and secured. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify such a partner and enter into an agreement with such partner on acceptable terms or at all.
HONEDRA® for Treatment of Critical Limb Ischemia
Our randomized, open-label, registration-eligible study of HONEDRA® in Japan for the treatment of CLI and Buerger's disease has, to date, demonstrated positive trends in both safety and efficacy. The HONEDRA® study's enrollment, however, has been significantly curtailed by the COVID-19 pandemic's impact in Japan, including the States of Emergency in Japan that have persisted for much of 2020, 2021, and 2022. Due to the significant and continued operational and financial burden incurred as a result of these COVID-19 delays, coupled with the unpredictability of the timing of site enrollment re-initiation, we suspended further enrollment in the fourth quarter of 2021. Following study suspension, we completed all protocol-defined patient observations and are preparing the clinical study report. HONEDRA® is now in the pre-consultation phase of the registration process with the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (“PMDA”) in Japan. Data from the follow-up of all patients completed in the registration-eligible clinical trial in Japan has been compiled and are being reviewed by the PMDA after which the PMDA is expected to provide important perspective to be considered in preparation for the formal consultation meetings which precede the Japanese new drug application. If successful in the pre-consultation process, we expect formal clinical consultation to occur during 2023. In the meantime, we are focusing our efforts on consummating a partnership for the product in Japan. Such a partnership may become the basis for the completion of development and registration of HONEDRA® in Japan and, eventually commercialization of the product in that country. Despite receipt of orphan designation from the FDA in March 2021 in the United States for LSTA12 as a potential treatment for Buerger's disease, based on a response from the FDA in October 2021 regarding a development plan for U.S. registration, we have decided not to pursue U.S. development in Buerger's disease.
LSTA201 for Treatment of Diabetic Kidney Disease
Progressive kidney failure is associated with attrition of the microcirculation of the kidney. Pre-clinical studies in kidney disease and injury models have demonstrated that protection or replenishment of the microcirculation results in improved kidney function. Based on these observations, we elected to move forward with a Phase 1b, open-label, proof-of-concept trial evaluating LSTA201 dosed via intra-renal artery injections in subjects with DKD. This protocol included six subjects in total with the first two subjects sequentially dosed and followed for a two-week safety observation period. Clearance by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (“DSMB”) overseeing the study then permitted the treatment of the next four patients, with all patients being followed for safety and therapeutic effect. A read-out of data will occur after the six-month follow-up visit for all patients. A key criterion for continued development of LSTA201 will be our ability to demonstrate a therapeutic effect that will make it competitive in the field of DKD treatment, i.e., kidney function regeneration, as indicated by increased glomerular filtration rate. The Company treated the first patient in the LSTA201 proof-of-concept study in April 2022 and completed treatment for all six subjects during the third quarter of 2022. Top line results, which were reported on February 6, 2023, showed that LSTA201 was safe and well-tolerated by patients with no serious adverse events related to the therapy. However, patients experienced no consistent increase in Glomerular Filtration Rate. Nevertheless, based on input from the study's principal investigator/key opinion leader, the Company believes there is still the potential for use of CD34+ cell therapy 
Index

for the treatment of DKD. However, further development of LSTA201 would require significantly larger studies and capital investment. Thus, LSTA201 development will only be continued if a strategic partner that can contribute the necessary capital for future development is identified.
TECHNOLOGY COLLABORATION AND OUT-LICENSING OPPORTUNITIES
Pancreatic Cancer & Advanced Solid Tumors (LSTA1: CendR Platform™)
Our lead investigational drug from the CendR Platform™, LSTA1, may hold broader potential to be combined as a co-administration treatment with an array of anti-cancer agents to benefit solid tumor cancer patients. We will seek to collaborate with chemotherapy, targeted- and immuno-therapy developers, in addition to our clinical collaboration with Roche/Genentech that plans to combine that company’s checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy Tecentriq (atezolizumab) with the LSTA1/gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel treatment regimen for treatment of pancreatic cancer. The Company plans to enter partnerships to exploit the CendR Platform™ for applications to enhance or enable effective treatment of solid tumor cancers across a range of treatment modalities, including nucleic acid-based treatments such as antisense, siRNA, mRNA and gene editing approaches, immunotherapies such as adoptive cell immunotherapy as well as immune checkpoint inhibitors, and additional targeted therapy treatments for solid tumor cancer applications. 
Intellectual Property Platform
Our developed and owned LSTA1 and CendR Platform™ patent portfolio comprises the following:
a.Two pending patent applications in the United States;

Product Opportunity for Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)
In the United States, there are approximately 62,000 new cases of pancreatic cancer diagnosed annually. Outside of the United States, there are an additional 434,000 annual pancreatic cancer diagnoses. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) accounts for more than 80% of all pancreatic cancer cases, so worldwide, nearly 397,000 annual incidences of PDAC are diagnosed. Further, PDAC is one of the most aggressive and lethal malignancies, with a 5-year survival rate of 11%, resulting in approximately 50,000 deaths annually in the United States alone. Moreover, on a global scale, pancreatic cancer results in over 466,000 deaths per year.
Ischemic Repair (CD34+ Cell Technology)
Our CD34+ Cell Technology is an autologous cell platform technology with potential application to a broad array of ischemic conditions and we will seek to out-license the technology in geographies and/or indications in which we do not intend to pursue development ourselves. 
Intellectual Property Platform
Our developed and owned ischemic repair patent portfolio comprises the following:
a.Nine U.S. patents, three European Union (“EU”) patents (each filed in four individual countries) and fourteen other patents in the United Kingdom, Japan, Canada, and Russia;
b.Claims cover, inter alia, a pharmaceutical composition that contains a therapeutic concentration of non-expanded CD34+ stem cells that move in response to SDF-1 or VEGF, together with a stabilizing amount of serum, that can be delivered to repair an injury caused by vascular insufficiency;

Market Opportunity for CLI
In Japan, there are approximately 300,000 patients with CLI, of whom approximately 51,000 are not candidates for revascularization, together with an addressable population of approximately 560,000 patients in the EU and 300,000 in the United States. 
The field of cardiovascular cell therapy development is competitive. There are a number of companies that are developing cell-based therapies for ischemic diseases. These companies are utilizing a number of different therapeutic approaches in their development efforts. There are both autologous and allogeneic based competitive therapies that derive cells principally from four sources: fat, peripheral blood, cord blood, and bone marrow. HONEDRA® is an autologous cell therapy that derives its cells from the peripheral blood of the patient via apheresis. 
Market Opportunity for CMD
In the United States there is an addressable population of approximately 400,000 to 1,600,000 patients with CMD, while the addressable population is roughly 1,200,000 to 4,800,000 in the EU and between 43,000 and 166,000 in Japan.
Market Opportunity for DKD
In the United States, stage 3 and 4 DKD patients represent an addressable population of approximately 7,000,000 and there is an estimated addressable population of 12,000,000 patients in the EU.
SEASONALITY
We do not believe that our operations are seasonal in nature.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION 
The healthcare industry is one of the most highly regulated industries in the United States and abroad. Various governmental regulatory authorities, as well as private accreditation organizations, oversee and monitor the activities of individuals and businesses engaged in the development, manufacture and delivery of health care products and services. The following is a general description of certain current laws and regulations that are relevant to our business:
Premarket Review and Approval of Pharmaceutical and Biological Products in the United States
Pharmaceutical and biological products, including cellular therapies, are subject to extensive pre- and post-market regulation by the FDA and other global agencies. For example, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act”) and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products, including biological products, intended for therapeutic uses. Biological products are approved for marketing under provisions of the Public Health Service Act (“PHS Act”). However, biological products that also meet the definition of “drugs” under the FD&C Act are also subject to regulation under FD&C Act provisions and to applicable provisions from two sets of implementing regulations, those for biological products and those for drugs. Another distinction between pharmaceuticals and cellular therapies is that the PHS Act requires the submission of a Biological Licensing Application (“BLA”), rather than a New Drug Application (“NDA”), for market authorization of a cellular therapy candidate like ours. Generally, the application process and requirements for product approval under BLA is similar to those for an NDA, and the review process for biological products is associated with similar approval risks and application costs as for chemical entity drug products.
Failure to comply with applicable requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, by the FDA and other global agencies, such as the issuance of a clinical hold, refusal to approve pending NDAs or BLAs, withdrawal of an approval, issuance of warning letters and other types of enforcement letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice, or DOJ, or other global governmental entities. Under certain circumstances, individual members of company management may also be subject to civil or criminal penalties related to company violations of applicable legal requirements.
An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new pharmaceutical or biological product in the United States typically must undertake the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the good laboratory practice or GLP regulations;
Index

•submission to a health authority of an IND or clinical trial application (“CTA”), which includes the detailed clinical protocol, which must take effect before human clinical trials can commence;
•approval of the clinical trial protocol and the sponsor's safeguards for human subjects by one or more institutional review boards, or “IRBs,” depending on the numbers of clinical sites and other features of the study design, before each clinical trial may be initiated;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or “GCPs,” to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug or biological product for each proposed indication for which regulatory approval is sought;
•satisfactory completion of regulatory audits of the Sponsor, clinical research organizations, or clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
•preparation and submission to a health authority of an NDA or BLA or MAA, as appropriate;
•review of the product by a regulatory advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable, as determined by the FDA at its discretion;
•satisfactory completion of one or more regulatory inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with the regulations establishing current Good Manufacturing Practices, or “cGMPs,” and current Good Tissue Practices or “cGTPs” (if applicable), and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls used for the manufacture, processing and packing of the drug or biological product are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and
•payment of applicable user fees and securing regulatory approval of the NDA or BLA or MAA. 
Satisfaction of regulatory pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease. Moreover, submission of an IND or CTA may not result in authorization to initiate a clinical trial if the regulator raises concerns or questions about the design of the clinical trial or the preclinical or manufacturing information supporting it, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. A separate submission to an existing IND or separate CTA must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. After a trial is initiated, a regulator may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with applicable requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with federal regulations and GCPs, which are meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors. In addition, sponsors of most clinical trials involving regulated products, including drugs and biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on a public registry and results database managed by the National Institutes of Health called ClinicalTrials.gov. Registration information that must be submitted includes information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. Failure to comply with applicable clinical trial registration or results reporting obligations can result in civil monetary penalties or the withholding of grant funds from a federally funded grantee.
Clinical trials for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or may be combined. Under certain circumstances, a fourth post-approval phase may be required.
•Phase 1: Trials in this phase are initially conducted in a limited population of healthy volunteers to test the product candidate for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion in healthy humans or, on occasion, in patients, such as cancer patients, when the drug or biologic is too toxic to be ethically given to healthy individuals.
•Phase 2: These clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to determine the presence and approximate magnitude of therapeutic effect of the product for specific targeted indications and to identify appropriate therapeutic dose and dose frequency as well as any corresponding additional possible adverse effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
Index

•Phase 3: These are commonly referred to as pivotal or registration studies. When Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dose range of the product is effective and has an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 clinical trials are typically undertaken in a larger patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple and geographically-dispersed clinical trial sites. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug or biologic as a requirement for marketing authorization.
•Phase 4: In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA or BLA for a product candidate on the sponsor's agreement to conduct additional clinical trials after NDA or BLA approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily carry out additional trials post approval to gain more information about the drug or biologic.
Submission of an NDA, BLA or MAA
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted as part of an NDA/BLA/MAA seeking approval to market the drug product for one or more indications. Approval of the NDA/BLA/MAA is required before marketing of the product may begin. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA/BLA/MAA is substantial. Most NDA/BLA/MAA submissions are additionally subject to a substantial application user fee. The current fee in the United States for fiscal year 2023 is $3,242,026 (some small businesses may qualify for a waiver under certain circumstances) and an annual program fee, currently $393,933, must also be paid for each approved prescription drug or biological product. These fees are typically adjusted annually.
Most regulators have a defined time frame from receipt of an NDA/BLA/MAA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the Agency's threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the regulator begins an in-depth review. If the application is not sufficiently complete, the regulator may issue a Refusal to File, or RTF, letter, although some regulators may permit an applicant to correct certain easily correctable deficiencies before filing without taking an official RTF action. Under certain review performance goals to which the agencies have agreed, most applications for standard review of drug or biological products are reviewed within ten to twelve months, and most applications for priority review drugs or biologics are reviewed within six to eight months. If a sponsor submits a major amendment to a filed NDA/BLA/MAA at any time during the review cycle, the regulator may extend these reviews. Priority review can be applied to drugs or biologics that, in the regulator's determination, offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment for a disease or condition for which no adequate therapy exists. Priority review requests must be submitted in conjunction with the original NDA/BLA/MAA for which the sponsor is seeking the designation, and the regulator decision will be made in conjunction with its official action to file the application and begin the substantive review process.
Before approving an NDA/BLA/MAA, the regulator will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to ensure compliance with GCPs. Additionally, the regulator will also inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. These pre-approval inspections cover all facilities associated with an NDA/BLA/MAA submission, including drug component manufacturing (such as active pharmaceutical ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing, and control testing laboratories. The regulator will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with applicable cGMP and cGTP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the drug or biological product within required specifications and the NDA or BLA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug or biologic is safe and effective for the proposed indication.
The regulator may refer applications for novel drug or biological products, or drug or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but the regulator will carefully consider them.
After the regulator fully evaluates the NDA/BLA/MAA and the relevant manufacturing facilities, the regulator will issue either an approval/licensure letter or a complete response letter (“CRL”). A CRL generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the regulator to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the regulator's satisfaction in a resubmitted NDA/BLA/MAA, the regulator will issue an approval letter. Regulators generally commit to reviewing such resubmissions within a specified time frame, depending on the type of information being provided to address the deficiencies in the CRL. Even with the submission of this additional information, however, the regulator ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
If the regulator approves a drug or biological product for marketing, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product; require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling; require that post-approval 
Index

studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug’s safety after approval; require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization; or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, such as a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy or “REMS,” which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The regulator may also limit further marketing of a product or withdraw the marketing approval, based on results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or patient populations, making certain types of manufacturing changes or seeking to make additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and regulator review and approval.
One potential condition of approval is that the regulator may require an applicant to develop a REMS to manage real or perceived risks of the product. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the regulator will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. REMS requirements are tailored to the specific risk/benefit profile of a drug and can include requirements such as medication guides for patients, detailed communication plans for health care professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or “ETASU.” ETASU may include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, restricted distribution, and the use of patient registries. The regulator may require a REMS as a condition of approval or may add such a requirement at any point post-approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product. The requirement for a REMS and the specific components that are involved can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a product. If the regulator concludes a REMS plan is needed, the sponsor of the NDA or BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The regulator will not approve an NDA without a REMS, if required.
Expedited Review Programs (Fast Track, Breakthrough, RMAT) and Accelerated Approval Pathways
The regulator is authorized to facilitate the development and expedite the review of certain drugs or biologics that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the Fast Track Program, the sponsor of an IND for a drug candidate may request that the regulator designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a Fast Track drug concurrent with, or after, the submission of the IND for the drug candidate. The regulator must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for Fast Track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. In addition to other benefits such as the ability to engage in more frequent interactions with the regulator, the regulator may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track drug’s NDA or BLA before the application is complete. This “rolling review” is available if the applicant provides, and the regulator approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. The regulator's time period goal for reviewing an application, however, does not begin until the last section of the NDA/BLA is submitted. Additionally, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the regulator if the regulator believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
Separately, under the regulator’s accelerated (conditional) approval regulations, the regulator may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients beyond existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow the regulator to withdraw approval of the drug such that accelerated approval is also referred to as U.S. “conditional” approval. Products granted accelerated approval also are subject to additional requirements for the pre-dissemination review by the regulator of proposed promotional materials both during the NDA review process and for 120 days after marketing approval.
In addition to the above, the regulator may designate an investigational product as a Breakthrough Therapy or as a Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (“RMAT”), depending on the type of investigational product and its ability to meet applicable eligibility criteria. Breakthrough Therapy designation is a process designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint(s). The RMAT designation requires similar eligibility criteria to be met, but it is available only to cell therapies, tissue therapies, and other products that meet the statutory definition of a “regenerative medicine therapy.” Specifically, a biological product is eligible for RMAT 
Index

designation if: (a) the product candidate is a regenerative medicine therapy, which is defined in the FD&C Act as a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or any combination product using such therapies or products, except for those regulated solely under the PHS Act (that is, excluding those biological products that are not also regulated as “drugs” under the FD&C Act); (b) the product candidate is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and (c) preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Both Breakthrough Therapy and RMAT designations are intended to help accelerate product development by allowing more frequent interactions with the regulator and receiving intensive regulator guidance on drug development.
Pediatric Information
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), NDAs or BLAs or supplements to NDAs or BLAs must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug or biologic for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. Sponsors must also submit pediatric trial plans and those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric trial or trials the applicant plans to conduct, including trial objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the regulator, and the regulator’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. The regulator or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time. The regulator may grant full or partial waivers or deferrals by age group for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation, although the regulator has recently taken steps to limit what it considers abuse of this statutory exemption in PREA by announcing that it does not intend to grant any additional orphan drug designations for rare pediatric subpopulations of what is otherwise a common disease.
The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (“BPCA”) provides approved NDA and BLA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity that attaches to the end of all existing marketing exclusivities and patents for the drug or biologic. Conditions for exclusivity include the regulator’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug or biologic in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the regulator making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the regulator's request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the regulator within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.
Orphan Drugs
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the regulator may designate a candidate as an orphan drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States) Orphan drug designation must be requested by an applicant before submitting an NDA or BLA for the relevant drug candidate. If the regulator grants orphan drug designation, the regulator will publicly disclose the generic identity of the drug candidate and its potential orphan use. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
If a product with orphan status receives the first regulator approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product generally will receive orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the regulator may not approve any other applications for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances comprising methods by which a second sponsor can demonstrate clinical superiority of its drug in comparison to the first approved orphan drug. Regardless of the orphan drug designation, a competitor may receive regulator approval for a different product (i.e., a different therapeutic agent from the orphan drug) for the same indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity and may obtain approval for the same product (i.e., the same therapeutic agent as the orphan drug) but for a different indication. If a designated orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was described in its orphan drug designation request, it may not be entitled to exclusivity under the Orphan Drug Act. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation, the sponsor receives a waiver of the NDA or BLA application user fee and is eligible for tax credits for certain research. The current tax credit regulation allows companies to claim up to 25% of the qualified clinical testing expenses in the current year and three prior years to offset their investment in rare (orphan) conditions.
Post-Approval Requirements
Drugs and biological products manufactured, marketed or distributed pursuant to regulator approval decisions are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the regulator, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, 
Index

periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion, and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as manufacturing changes or adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to regulator review and approval before they can be implemented. There also are continuing, annual program fee requirements for any marketed, approved prescription products, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture of approved drugs are required to register their facilities with the regulator and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the regulator for compliance with cGMP/cGTP requirements. Prescription drug distribution facilities are also subject to state licensure, including inspections, by the relevant local regulatory authority. Changes to the manufacturing process, specifications or container closure system for an approved drug or biologic are strictly regulated and often require prior regulator approval before being implemented. Regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP or cGTP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and others involved in the product’s manufacturing process. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP/cGTP compliance and ensure ongoing compliance with other statutory requirements the FD&C Act, such as the requirements for making manufacturing changes to an approved NDA or BLA.
Even after a new drug or biologic approval is granted, the regulator may withdraw that approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. If a previously unknown problem, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, is discovered or the manufacturer fails to comply with regulatory requirements, the regulator may require revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; may impose additional post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or may impose distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences of regulatory non-compliance include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
•refusal of the regulator to approve pending NDAs/BLAs or supplements to approved NDAs/BLAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; 
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties;
•consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment, or exclusion from federal health care programs; or
•mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information.
Health authorities strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of prescription drug and biological products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant penalties. In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to a variety of federal and state laws.
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. Most recently, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCSA, was enacted with the aim of building an electronic system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs distributed in the United States, including most biological products. The DSCSA mandates phased-in and resource-intensive obligations for pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers over a 10‑year period. The original DSCSA requirements for traceability at the product lot level are expected to be in force by November 2023. However new requirements are being developed to require traceability of product at the package level and these are expected to begin implementation in 2023. From time to time, additional new legislation and regulations may be implemented that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the 
Index

FDA. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or regulatory changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
Other Health Care Regulations
If our product candidates are approved in the United States, we will have to comply with various U.S. federal and state laws, rules and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and physician self-referral laws, rules and regulations. Violations of the fraud and abuse laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, in some instances, exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Other federal and state laws and regulations that could directly or indirectly affect our ability to operate the business and/or financial performance include:
–state and local licensure, applicable to the processing and storage of human cells and tissues;
–laws and regulations administered by the United States Department of Health and Human Services, including the Office for Human Research Protections and the Office of Inspector General;
–state laws and regulations governing human subject research;
–federal and state coverage and reimbursement laws and regulations, including laws and regulations administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and state Medicaid agencies;
–the federal Medicare and Medicaid Anti-Kickback Law and similar state laws and regulations;
–the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and similar state laws and regulations;
–the federal physician self-referral prohibition commonly known as the Stark Law, and state equivalents of the Stark Law;
–the federal transparency requirements under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act that require manufacturers of FDA-approved drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies covered by Medicare or Medicaid to report, on an annual basis, to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value physicians, teaching hospitals, and certain advanced non-physician health care practitioners and physician ownership and investment interests;
–Occupational Safety and Health Administration requirements;
–state and local laws and regulations dealing with the handling and disposal of medical waste; and
–the Intermediate Sanctions rules of the IRS providing for potential financial sanctions with respect to “Excess Benefit Transactions” with tax-exempt organizations.
Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines, or the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures to the extent that those laws impose requirements that are more stringent than the Physician Payments Sunshine Act. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Japan's Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Authority Regulation of Regenerative Medicine 
Prior to 2014, there was no specific regulatory oversight of regenerative medicine products in Japan. However, in November 2013, the Japanese authorities revised the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law and renamed it the Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices, and Other Therapeutic Products Act (the “PMD Act”). The new legislation became effective on November 25, 2014 and provides for a timely introduction of innovative regenerative medicine products. The new legislation formalizes a legal basis for development of regenerative medicine therapies. The new legislation defines regenerative medicine products as processed human cells that are intended to be used for either (1) the reconstructive repair, or formation of structures or functions of the human body; (2) the treatment or prevention of human diseases; or (3) gene therapy.
The legislation allows the PMDA/Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (“MHLW”) to award conditional approval to a regenerative medicine therapy if there is evidence of adequate safety and results which predict likely efficacy. The evidence for efficacy may be based on surrogate endpoints and may come from an exploratory study. This conditional approval is time-
Index

limited, and there must be an agreement with PMDA/MHLW as to follow-up collection of information which confirms efficacy and safety, similar to a post-marketing commitment in the United States.
Under the PMD Act, products under consideration may also be given a SAKIGAKE designation (similar to an FDA “Breakthrough” or “RMAT” designation in certain respects) with a priority six month review period. Additionally, there is a commitment that the PMDA will facilitate research and development by giving scientific and regulatory advice to sponsors from the early stage of development.
According to the new legislation, the sponsor prepares a marketing authorization application which is submitted for review to the PMDA. The PMDA reviews the application and prepares a review report and recommendation which is submitted to the MHLW. The MHLW reviews the recommendation and makes a decision regarding approval of the product. This procedure allows for both a conditional approval and subsequently for a full approval after the post-marketing commitments have been fulfilled.
SUMMARY OF RISK FACTORS
Our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that are summarized below. The below summary of risk factors should be read together with the more detailed discussion of risks set forth following this section under the heading “Risk Factors,” as well as elsewhere in this Annual Report. 
•We have incurred substantial losses and negative cash flow from operations in the past and expect to continue to incur losses and negative cash flow for the foreseeable future. Additionally, we anticipate that we will need substantial additional financing to continue our operations; if we are unable to raise additional capital, we may be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate one or more of our product development programs, and our business will consequently be harmed.
•We are substantially dependent on our lead product candidate, LSTA1. If we are unable to advance LSTA1 or any of our other product candidates through clinical development, obtain regulatory approval and ultimately begin commercializing, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.
•The commercial potential and profitability of our product candidates are unknown. We currently have no marketing and sales organization and have no experience in marketing products, and our products may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, hospitals, cancer treatment centers and others in the medical community.
•Our cell therapy business is based on novel technologies that are inherently expensive and risky.
•We recently completed the Merger and face ongoing risks related to the ongoing integration of our business with Cend’s business as well as potential Merger-related litigation.
•Our business has been and may continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
•We may be unable to manage multiple late-stage clinical trials for a variety of product candidates simultaneously.
•If serious or unacceptable side effects are identified during the development of any of our product candidates, we may need to abandon or limit our development of that product candidate.
•A Fast Track or breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA and other similar regulatory designations may not lead to a faster development, regulatory review, or approval process.
•Our clinical trials may fail to demonstrate adequately the safety and efficacy of our product candidates, which failure would prevent or delay regulatory approval and commercialization.
•We presently rely on contract manufacturing organizations to produce our product candidates at development and commercial scale quantities and have not yet qualified an alternate manufacturing supply, which could negatively impact our ability to meet any future demand for the products.
•Any supply chain disruption could impact our ability to perform clinical trials and seek future regulatory submissions.
•We may enter into collaborations, strategic alliances, additional licensing arrangements, acquisitions, business combinations and/or other strategic transactions, and we may not realize the benefits of any such arrangement. 
•If competitors develop and market products that are more effective, safer, or less expensive than our product candidates or offer other advantages, our commercial prospects will be limited.
•We may need to grow the size of our organization, and may experience difficulties in managing this growth.
Index

•We are involved in a litigation matter that may consume resources and management time, and an adverse resolution could require us to pay damages or otherwise adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.
•We may be subject to significant product liability claims and litigation, including potential exposure from the use of our product candidates in human subjects, and our insurance may be inadequate to cover claims that may arise.
•We may be unable to hire or retain key officers or employees needed to implement our business strategy.
•A variety of risks associated with operating our business internationally could materially adversely affect our business. 
•We conduct significant operations through our Australian subsidiary. If we lose our ability to operate in Australia, or if the subsidiary loses eligibility for certain Australian tax credits, our business and results of operations will suffer.
•Our internal computer systems, or those used by our clinical investigators, clinical research organizations or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of development programs for our product candidates. 
•The development and commercialization of our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation and the failure to receive regulatory approvals would likely have a material and adverse effect on our business and prospects. Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval of our product candidates in one jurisdiction does not mean that it will be successful in obtaining regulatory approval of our product candidates in other jurisdictions.
•We may be subject to numerous and varying privacy and security laws, and our failure to comply could result in penalties and reputational damage.
•We will continue to be subject to extensive regulation following any product approvals, and if we fail to comply with these regulations, we may suffer a significant setback in our business.
•Health care companies have been the subject of federal and state investigations, and we could become subject to investigations in the future. Further, unintended consequences of health care reform legislation in the United States may adversely affect our business.
•It is uncertain to what extent government, private health insurers and third-party payors will approve coverage or provide reimbursement for the therapies and products to which our research and development relate. 
•Inadequate funding for the FDA, the SEC and other government agencies could prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner or otherwise prevent those agencies from performing normal business functions on which the operation of our business may rely, which could negatively impact our business.
•If we are unable to obtain or maintain our licenses, patents or other intellectual property we could lose important protections that are material to continuing our operations and our future prospects.
•Litigation and third-party claims relating to intellectual property are expensive, time-consuming and uncertain, and we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to protect against infringement by third parties or defend ourselves against claims of infringement.
•Our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to limitations.
•Our stock price has been, and will likely continue to be, highly volatile.
•We may fail to comply with the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, such that our common stock may be delisted and our ability to access the capital markets could be negatively impacted.
•Future fundraising and strategic transactions may cause dilution, and we currently have a significant number of securities outstanding that are exercisable for our common stock, which could result in significant additional dilution.
•Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover, which could limit the price investors are willing to pay for our common stock and could entrench management.
•Failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.
