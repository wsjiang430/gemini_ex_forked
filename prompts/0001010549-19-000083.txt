Overview
--------

 Greenway Technologies, Inc., through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Greenway Innovative Energy, Inc., is primarily engaged in the research, development and commercialization of a proprietary Gas-to-Liquids (GTL) syngas conversion system that can be economically scaled to meet individual natural gas field/resource requirements. The Company's proprietary and patented technology has now been realized in Greenway's recently completed first generation commercial-scale G-ReformerTM unit, a unique and critical component to the Company's overall GTL technology solution. Greenway's objective is to become a material direct and licensed producer of renewable GTL synthesized diesel and jet fuels, with a near term focus on U.S. market opportunities. 
 Greenway’s GTL Technology
 In August 2012, Greenway Technologies acquired 100% of Greenway Innovative Energy, Inc. (“GIE”) which owns patents and trade secrets for a proprietary technology to convert natural gas into synthesis gas (“syngas”). Based on a new, breakthrough process called Fractional Thermal Oxidation™ (“FTO”), the Company believes that GIE’s G-Reformer, combined with conventional Fischer-Tropsch (“FT”) processes, offers an economical and scalable method to converting natural gas to liquid fuel. On February 15, 2013, GIE filed for its first patent on its GTL technology. U.S. Patent number 8,574,501 was issued on November 5, 2013. On November 4, 2013, GIE filed for a second patent covering other unique aspects of the design. The Company has identified several other areas in its technology to file for patent protection and such efforts are ongoing.
 On June 26, 2017, Greenway, in conjunction with the University of Texas at Arlington (“UTA”), announced that they had successfully demonstrated Greenway’s GTL technology at the Company sponsored Conrad Greer Laboratory at UTA, proving the viability of the science behind the technology.
 On March 6, 2018, the Company announced the completion of its first commercial scale G-Reformer. The G-Reformer is the critical component of the Company’s innovative Greer-Wright Gas-to-Liquids system. A team consisting of individuals from the Company, UTA and the Company’s contracted fabricator worked together to test and calibrate the newly-built G-Reformer unit. The testing substantiated the units’ synthesis gas generation capability and demonstrated additional proficiencies within certain prior prescribed testing metrics.

The Company believes that its proprietary G-Reformer is a major innovation in gas reforming and GTL technology in general. Initial tests have demonstrated that the Company’s solution is superior to legacy technologies which are costly, have a larger footprint and cannot be easily deployed at field sites to process associated gas, stranded gas, coal-bed methane, vented gas, or flared gas, all markets the Company seeks to service. The proprietary technology based around the G-Reformer is unique in that it also allows for transportable GTL plants with a much smaller footprint when compared to legacy large-scale technologies. The Company believes its technologies and processes will allow for GTL plants to be built with substantially lower up-front and ongoing costs resulting in more profitable results for O&G operators. Greenway is now working to commercialize both its G-Reformer and its GTL solutions and is in discussions with a number of oil and gas companies, smaller oil and gas operators and other interested parties to license and obtain joint venture or other forms of capital funding to build its first complete gas-to-liquid plant.
 GTL Industry –Market 
 GTL converts natural gas – the cleanest-burning fossil fuel – into high-quality liquid products that would otherwise be made from crude oil. These products include transport fuels, motor oils and the ingredients for everyday necessities like plastics, detergents and cosmetics. GTL products are colorless and odorless. They contain almost none of the impurities, e.g., sulphur, aromatics and nitrogen, that are found in crude oil.
 According to industry research, the market for GTL products accounted for $10.98 billion in 2017 and is expected to reach $22.89 billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 8.5%. Products created by this process include GTL Diesel, GTL Naphtha, GTL Other (e.g., lubricants), where GTL Diesel accounts for more than 68% of the market. Market share of these products has not changed significantly over the last four years. Increasing population across the globe have led to the increase in the power consumption. There is a high demand for clean natural gas liquids products (“NGL”) in the commercial sector, including as blend-stock for petrochemical plants and refineries, as well as in the automobile and packaging industries, among others. Due to their clean nature, NGL products have wide use as fuel in motor vehicles, furnaces for heating and cooking, and as a household energy source. Greenway’s focus is in the production of high cetane diesel and Jet A fuels, a multi-billion-dollar market segment.
 Development of stringent environmental regulations by numerous governments to control pollution and promote cleaner fuel sources is expected to complement industry growth. U.S. guidelines implemented such as the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board Act, 2006, Oilfields (Regulation and Development) Act of 1948, and Oil Industry (Development) Act, 1974 are likely to continue to encourage GTL applications in diverse end-use industries to conserve natural gas and other resources.
 Key industry players include: Linc Energy; Gas Techno; Compact GTL; Primus Green Energy; Chevron Corporation; Velocys; Royal Dutch Shell; Sasol Limited; NRG Energy; Ventech Engineers and Petrobras. In terms of production and consumption, Shell had the largest market share in 2018, virtually all of which is located overseas.
 Mining Interest
 In December 2010, UMED acquired the rights to approximately 1,440 acres of placer mining claims located on Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) land in Mohave County, Arizona for 5,066,000 shares of restricted Common A stock. Early indications, from samples taken and processed, provided reason to believe that the potential recovery value of the metals located on the 1,440 acres is significant, but only actual mining and processing will determine the ultimate value which may be realized from this property holding. The Company is currently exploring strategic options to partner or sell its interest in this acreage, while it focuses on its emerging GTL technology sales and marketing efforts.
Company History
 Greenway Technologies, Inc. was originally incorporated as Dynalyst Manufacturing Corporation (“Dynalyst”) under the laws of the State of Texas on March 13, 2002. In connection with the merger with Universal Media Corporation (“UMC”), a Nevada corporation, on August 17, 2009, the Company changed its name to Universal Media Corporation. The transaction was accounted for as a reverse merger, and Universal Media Corporation was the acquiring company on the basis that Universal Media Corporation’s senior management became the entire senior management of the merged entity and there was a change of control of Dynalyst. The transaction was accounted for as recapitalization of Dynalyst’s capital structure. In connection with the merger,

Dynalyst issued 57,500,000 restricted common shares to the shareholders of Universal Media Corporation for 100% of Universal Media Corporation.
 On August 18, 2009, Dynalyst approved the amendment of its articles of incorporation and filed with the Texas Secretary of State an amendment to change its name to Universal Media Corporation and approved the increase in authorized shares to 300,000,000 shares of common A stock, par value $0.0001 and 20,000,000 shares of common B, par value $0.0001.
 On March 23, 2011, Universal Media Corporation approved the amendment of its articles of incorporation and filed with the Texas Secretary of State an amendment to change our name to UMED Holdings, Inc.
 On June 22, 2017, Greenway Technologies, Inc.in recognition of its primary operational activity, approved the amendment of its certificate of formation and filed on June 23, 2017, with the Texas Secretary of State to change its name to: Greenway Technologies, Inc.
 Employees
 As of April 15, 2019, we have 5 full-time employees. Four of these employees are located in, or near our corporate offices in Arlington, Texas; one is located in North Carolina, but travels extensively on Company business. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our employee relations to be satisfactory.
Going Concern
 The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $26,818,584. During the twelve-months ended December 31, 2018, the Company used net cash of $1,289,436 for operating activities. As a pre-revenue entity, these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. While the Company is attempting to commence revenue generating operations and thereby generate sustainable revenues, the Company’s current cash position is not sufficient to support its daily operations.
 The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is therefore in doubt and dependent upon achieving a profitable level of operations or on the ability of the Company to obtain necessary financing to fund ongoing operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of public or private offerings, or both. Management believes that the actions presently being taken to implement the Company’s business plan and generate revenues will provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. While Management believes in the viability of its strategy to generate revenues and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to further implement our business plan and generate revenues.
