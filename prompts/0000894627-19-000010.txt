 Item 1. Business
 BACKGROUND
 VAALCO Energy, Inc. is a Delaware corporation, incorporated in 1985 and headquartered at 9800 Richmond Avenue, Suite 700, Houston, Texas 77042. Our telephone number is (713) 623-0801 and our website address is www.vaalco.com. As used in this Annual Report, the terms, “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” and “VAALCO” refer to VAALCO Energy, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires.
 We are a Houston, Texas-based independent energy company engaged in the acquisition, exploration, development and production of crude oil. Our primary source of revenue has been from the Etame PSC related to the Etame Marin block located offshore Gabon in

West Africa. We also currently own interests in an undeveloped block offshore Equatorial Guinea, West Africa. Our consolidated subsidiaries are VAALCO Gabon (Etame), Inc., VAALCO Production (Gabon), Inc., VAALCO Gabon S.A., VAALCO Angola (Kwanza), Inc., VAALCO UK (North Sea), Ltd., VAALCO International, Inc., VAALCO Energy (EG), Inc., VAALCO Energy Mauritius (EG), Limited and VAALCO Energy (USA), Inc. 
 STRATEGY
 We own producing properties and conduct operating activities offshore West Africa with a focus on maximizing the value of our Gabon resources and expanding into new development opportunities across Africa. Our financial results are heavily dependent upon the margins between prices received for our offshore Gabon oil production and the costs to find and produce such oil. In light of the volatility of oil prices over the past several years, we have focused on maximizing our margins by reducing costs, paying off debt, divesting non-core assets, minimizing capital expenditures and maintaining our existing production at optimal levels.  On September 25, 2018, the term of the Etame PSC with Gabon related to the Etame Marin block located offshore Gabon was extended through 2028 with options to extend up to an additional ten years (“PSC Extension”). The PSC Extension provides us with the extended time horizon necessary to pursue developing the resources we have identified at Etame.  As a result of these efforts, our financial position has improved, and we believe that we have working capital sufficient to sustain current operations and fund development projects on our Etame license in Gabon. In combination with improved oil pricing and positive production performance, the PSC Extension enabled us to increase proved reserves during 2018 by 76% to 5.4 MMBbls at December 31, 2018 which include reserves for wells we are drilling in 2019. We are seeking to further increase production and reserves by pursuing accretive growth opportunities where we can leverage our proven technical and operational capabilities in areas where we have established favorable relationships with host governments and local joint venture owners. 
 Our strategy is to create long-term value for all stakeholders by focusing on profitable growth from low-risk reserve development while maintaining financial discipline. Specifically, we seek to:

· | Focus on maintaining production and lowering costs to increase margins and preserve optionality to capitalize on an increase in prices;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Manage capital expenditures related to our Etame 2019 drilling program so that expenditures can be funded by cash on hand and cash from operations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Continue our focus on operating safely and complying with internationally accepted environmental operating standards;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Optimize production through careful management of wells and infrastructure, including minimizing downtime;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Maximize our cash flow and income generation;
--+----------------------------------------------


· | Continue planning for additional development in Etame as well as future exploration and development in Equatorial Guinea;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Preserve a strong balance sheet by maintaining conservative leverage ratios and exhibiting financial discipline;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Opportunistically hedge against exposures to changes in oil prices; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Actively pursue strategic, value-accretive mergers and acquisitions of similar properties to diversify our portfolio of producing assets.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We believe that we have strong management and technical expertise specific to West Africa, and that our strengths include: 

· | Our reputation as a safe and efficient operator in Africa;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


· | Our history of establishing favorable operating relationships with host governments and local joint venture owners;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Our subsurface knowledge of key plays and risks in the broader regional framework of discoveries and fields;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Our operational capacity to take on new development projects;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


· | Our familiarity with local practices and infrastructure; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


· | Our market intelligence to provide early insight into available opportunities.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION
 For operating segment and geographic financial information, see Note 5 to the Financial Statements. Our only reportable operating segments are Gabon and Equatorial Guinea.
 Gabon Segment
 Offshore – Etame Marin Block
 Our most significant asset, which accounts for approximately 100% of our current revenues, is the Etame PSC related to the Etame Marin block located offshore Gabon. The Etame Marin block covers an area of approximately 46,200 gross acres located 20 miles offshore in water depths of approximately 250 feet. The Etame, Avouma/South Tchibala, Ebouri, Southeast Etame and North Tchibala fields are included in the block. Our working interest in the Etame Marin block is 31.1%, and we are designated as the operator on behalf of a consortium of four companies (which we refer to as the “Consortium”). The fields are subject to a 7.5% back-in carried interest by the government of Gabon, which they have assigned to a third party.  Our working interest decreases to 30.3% in June 2026 when the back-in carried interest increases to 10%.

Fields in the Etame Marin block.  There are currently five producing fields in the Etame Marin block: the Etame field which currently has five producing wells; the Avouma/South Tchibala field which currently has three producing wells; the Ebouri field which currently has one producing well; the Southeast Etame field which currently has one producing well and the North Tchibala field which has two wells producing from the Dentale formation.
 Development.  Following the installation of the platform for the Etame field and the platform for the Southeast Etame/North Tchibala fields in 2014, we commenced a multi-well drilling campaign which brought on five new wells in 2015.  In February 2016, due to the continuing low commodity prices, we released the rig and incurred expenses of $7.9 million in 2016, net to us, related to its demobilization and early release. These expenses are reflected in “Other operating expenses” in the Financial Statements. See also “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations – Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016.”
 On November 22, 2016, we closed on the purchase of an additional 2.98% working interest (3.23% participating interest) in the Etame Marin block from Sojitz Etame Limited (“Sojitz”), which had an effective date of August 1, 2016.  See Note 4 of the Financial Statements for further discussion.
 Periodically, we perform workovers on our wells to maintain or restore production. In May 2018 we mobilized a hydraulic workover unit to the Avouma platform to replace the electronic submersible pump (“ESP”) systems in the Avouma 2-H and the South Tchibala 1-HB wells and restored production to both wells in June 2018. While the hydraulic workover unit was on location, we decided to pro-actively replace the ESPs in the South Tchibala 2-H well to upgrade the system to those just installed in the other two wells.  Since completion of the Avouma workovers in 2018, the new ESP systems have operated continuously as designed. Excluding the Avouma platform wells, the wells with ESPs on our three other platforms have operated without incident for up to four years.     As discussed in Note 9, the PSC Extension requires the Consortium to drill two wells and two appraisal well bores by September 16, 2020. The Consortium is planning to drill the two wells and two appraisal well bores during the second half of 2019. The Consortium may drill a third well as part of this drilling campaign.  
 Our current net production is averaging approximately 3,752 BOPD, up from a 3,500 BOPD average for fiscal year 2017 as a result of the workovers performed in 2018. 
 At December 31, 2018, we had estimated net proved reserves of 5.4 MMBbls. For 2018, our proved reserve additions of 3.7 MMBbl were equal to 270% of our 2018 Gabon production, as reflected in the reserve report issued by our independent petroleum engineering firm, Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (“NSAI”).  We added 1.1 MMBbls of reserves through reservoir performance additions and proved undeveloped reserves, 2.2 MMBO as a result of the PSC Extension and 0.4 MMBbls through positive pricing revisions. The increase in the average of the first-day-of-the-month prices adjusted for quality, transportation fees and market differentials required by SEC rules to determine reserves, was from $53.49 for the 2017 year-end report to $70.83 for the 2018 year-end report.  
 For 2018, our total proved reserves replacement was 270% of our 2018 total net production in Gabon. See “— Reserve Information” below. These results occurred primarily due to (i) better-than-forecasted results for production and (ii) increased crude oil prices.
 Production.  Production operations in the Etame Marin block include nine platform wells, plus three subsea wells across all fields tied back by pipelines to deliver oil and associated natural gas through a riser system to allow for delivery, processing, storage and ultimately offloading the oil from a leased FPSO vessel anchored to the seabed on the block. Production from seven of our wells is aided by ESPs.  We currently have twelve producing wells.  The FPSO has production limitations of approximately 25,000 BOPD and 30,000 barrels of total fluids per day. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, aggregate production from the block was approximately 5.1 MMBbls (1.4 MMBbls net to us), 5.6 MMBbls (1.5 MMBbls net to us) and 6.2 MMBbls (1.5 MMBbls net to us), respectively. Our net share of barrels produced reflects an allocation of cost oil and profit oil after reduction for a royalty of approximately 13%.
 Hydrogen Sulfide Impact
 Four of our wells are currently shut-in for safety and marketability reasons because of high levels of hydrogen sulfide (“H2S”). These wells have been excluded from the above-referenced well count.  To re-establish and maximize production from the impacted areas, additional capital investment will be required, including the construction of one or more processing facilities capable of removing H2S, the recompletion of the temporarily abandoned wells and the potential drilling of additional wells. Previously, these identified processing facilities were not economic; however, the Consortium will be re-evaluating this during 2019. As of December 31, 2018, we had no proved reserves booked for the wells impacted by high levels of H2S. Exploration
 At December 31, 2018, we had $13.7 million in undeveloped leasehold costs related to the Etame Marin block. These costs are associated with the exploitation area expansion related to the PSC Extension. Abandonment Costs
 Under the PSC terms, the Consortium has agreed to a cash funding arrangement for the eventual abandonment of all offshore wells, platforms and facilities on the Etame Marin block.  We are required under the Etame PSC to conduct abandonment studies to update the amounts being funded for the eventual abandonment of the offshore wells, platforms and facilities on the Etame Marin block. The current abandonment study was completed in November 2018 resulting in estimated gross abandonment costs of approximately $61.8   
 
8

million ($19.2 million, net to VAALCO) on an undiscounted basis. Through December 31, 2018, $37.4 million ($11.6 million, net to VAALCO) on an undiscounted basis has been funded. The annual abandonment cost requirements net to VAALCO are expected to be $0.8 million for 2019 through 2028.  Amounts paid are reimbursable through the Cost Account and are non-refundable.  Our estimated liabilities for the abandonment of these Gabon offshore facilities as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $14.8 million and $20.2 million, respectively, which are included in the total “Asset retirement obligation” line item on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. Initial recording of this liability is offset by a corresponding capitalization of asset retirement costs reflected under “Property and equipment – successful efforts method” in the line item “Wells, platforms and other production facilities” on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.
 Equatorial Guinea Segment
 We have a 31% working interest in an undeveloped portion of a block offshore Equatorial Guinea that we acquired in 2012 (the “Block P interest”). For a number of years, the Block P interest was in suspension; however, in September 2018, the Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons lifted the suspension.  We are awaiting the Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons (the “EG MMH”) to approve our appointment as technical operator for Block P.  Compania Nacional de Petroleos de Guinea Equatorial (“GEPetrol”) will act as the administrative operator.  Under the terms of lifting of the suspension, a new joint owner is expected to assume GEPetrol’s working interest obligations and be presented to the EG MMH by March 28, 2019.  Once the joint owner is approved, we are required to drill one exploration well within one year.  While there is no monetary penalty for failing to meet the terms of the lifting of the suspension, we would lose our interest in the license, and the associated capitalized unproved leasehold costs of $10.0 million as of December 31, 2018 would become impaired.  We and our joint venture owners are evaluating the timing and budgeting for development and exploration activities under a development and production area in the block, including the approval of a development and production plan.  Our production sharing contract covering this development and production area provides for a development and production period of 25 years from the date of approval of a development and production plan.     Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) Production Reductions
 During 2017 and 2018, Gabon, as a member of OPEC, agreed to reduce its production by up to 9,000 Bbl per day.  As a result of natural production declines, production in 2017 and 2018 was not impacted by this agreement. In December 2018, OPEC decided to further reduce overall production by 0.8 MBOPD for the first six months of 2019 versus the October 2018 levels.  We have not been advised whether this will require us to reduce production for 2019.  We do not expect our production or drilling plans will be impacted by the agreement because of natural declines in production and because production from the new wells would not occur until later in 2019.  Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that this agreement or future agreements would not result in limitations on our production.
 DRILLING ACTIVITY
 We have had no drilling activity during the period from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018.  As discussed above, we are planning to drill up to two to three wells, and two appraisal well bores during 2019 at the Etame Marin block.

  RESERVE INFORMATION
 Estimated Reserves and Estimated Future Net Revenues
 Reserve Data
 In accordance with the current guidelines of the SEC, estimates of future net cash flow from our properties and the present value thereof are made using an unweighted, arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each of the 12 months of the year adjusted for quality, transportation fees and market differentials. Such prices are held constant throughout the life of the properties except where such guidelines permit alternate treatment, including the use of fixed and determinable contractual price escalations. For 

 
9

2018, the average of such price used for our reserve estimates was $70.83 per Bbl for crude oil from Gabon. This compares to the average of such price used for 2017 of $53.49 per Bbl.
 Reserves reported below consist of net proved reserves related to the Etame Marin block located offshore Gabon in West Africa.  There have been no estimates of total proved net oil or natural gas reserves filed with or included in reports to any federal authority or agency other than the SEC since the beginning of the last fiscal year.  The table below sets forth our estimated net proved reserve quantities for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 as prepared by NSAI, independent petroleum engineers.

  ﻿
 The information set forth in the foregoing tables includes revisions for certain reserve estimates attributable to proved properties included in preceding years’ estimates. Such revisions are the result of additional information from subsequent completions and production history from the properties involved or the result of an increase or decrease in the projected economic life of such properties resulting from changes in product prices. Crude oil amounts shown for Gabon are recoverable under a PSC, and the reserves in place at the end of the contract remain the property of the Gabon government.  The reserves at the end of the contract are not included in the table above.
 We do not reflect proved reserves on discoveries in our reserve estimates until such time as a development plan has been prepared and approved by our joint owners and the government, where applicable.  The proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2018 in the table above are related to the two wells which the Consortium plans to drill in 2019.  
 In 2018, we replaced 270% of production by adding a total of 3.7 MMBbls of proved reserves including 2.2 MMBbls of proved reserves additions as a result of extending the Etame PSC in Gabon. VAALCO also added 1.1 MMBbls of proved reserves as a result of improved reservoir performance and another 0.4 MMBbls of proved reserves as a result of higher oil pricing.
 The upward revision of the previous estimates of proved reserves in 2017 were primarily a result of improved well performance and to a lesser degree the higher average crude oil prices.  
 The upward revision of the previous estimates of proved reserves in 2016 was primarily a result of improved well performance and lower costs. Purchases of minerals in place in 2016 was related to the additional 2.98% working interest in the Etame Marin block we acquired from Sojitz in November 2016. The lower average crude oil price used for 2016 estimates only partially offset the favorable 

 
10

impacts of well performance, operating cost reductions, and the other factors. Sales of minerals in place in 2016 was related to the sale of the Hefley field in the U.S. in December 2016. 
 There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures, including many factors beyond our control. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner, and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. The quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered, production and operating costs, the amount and timing of future development expenditures and future oil and natural gas sales prices may all differ from those assumed in these estimates. The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows should not be construed as the current market value of the estimated oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties.
 Historically, we have reviewed on an annual basis all of our proved undeveloped reserves (“PUDs”) to ensure an appropriate plan for development exists.  At December 31, 2018, we had PUDs associated with the two wells which the Consortium plans to drill in 2019.  As a result of crude oil prices in 2017 and 2016, our PUDs were uneconomic to develop at prices calculated in accordance with SEC guidelines. Accordingly, we had no PUDs recorded at December 31, 2017 and 2016. 
 Controls over Reserve Estimates
 Our policies and practices regarding internal controls over the recording of reserves is structured to objectively and accurately estimate our oil and natural gas reserves quantities and present values in compliance with SEC regulations and generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”). Compliance with these rules and regulations with respect to our reserves is the responsibility of a reservoir engineer, who is our principal engineer. Our principal engineer has over 20 years of experience in the oil and natural gas industry, including over 10 years as a reserve evaluator and trainer, and is a qualified reserves estimator, as defined by the Society of Petroleum Engineers’ standards. Further professional qualifications include a Bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering and Master’s degree in petroleum engineering, extensive internal and external reserve training, and asset evaluation and management. In addition, the principal engineer is an active participant in industry reserve seminars, professional industry groups and is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors meets periodically with management to discuss matters and policies related to reserves.
 Our controls over reserve estimation include retaining NSAI as our independent petroleum and geological firm for all years presented. We provide information to NSAI about our oil and natural gas properties which includes, but is not limited to, production profiles, ownership and production sharing rights, prices, costs and future drilling plans. NSAI prepares its own estimates of the reserves attributable to our properties. The reserves estimates shown herein have been independently evaluated by NSAI, a worldwide leader of petroleum property analysis for industry and financial organizations and government agencies. NSAI was founded in 1961 and performs consulting petroleum engineering services under Texas Board of Professional Engineers Registration No. F-2699. Within NSAI, the technical persons primarily responsible for preparing the estimates set forth in the NSAI reserves report incorporated herein are Mr. John R. Cliver and Mr. Zachary R. Long. Mr. Cliver, a Licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Texas, has been practicing consulting petroleum engineering at NSAI since 2009 and has over 5 years of prior industry experience. He graduated from Rice University in 2004 with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Chemical Engineering and from the University of Texas at Austin in 2008 with a Master of Business Administration Degree. Mr. Long, a Licensed Professional Geoscientist in the State of Texas, has been practicing consulting petroleum geoscience at NSAI since 2007 and has over 2 years of prior industry experience. He graduated from University of Louisiana at Lafayette in 2003 with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Geology and from Texas A&M University in 2005 with a Master of Science Degree in Geophysics.

 CUSTOMERS
 For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we sold our crude oil production from Gabon under a term contract with pricing based upon an average of Dated Brent in the month of lifting, adjusted for location and market factors. The contracted purchaser was Glencore Energy UK Ltd. (“Glencore”) for these periods and through January 2019. Sales of oil to Glencore were approximately 100% of revenues sold to customers for 2018. We have signed a new contract with Mercuria Energy Trading SA which covers sales from February 2019 through January 2020.
 The terms of the Etame PSC includes provisions for payments to the government of Gabon for: royalties based on 13% of production at the published price and a shared portion of “Profit Oil” determined based on daily production rates, as well as a gross carried working interest of 7.5% (increasing to 10% beginning June 20, 2026) for all costs.  Prior to February 1, 2018, the government of Gabon did not take any of its share of Profit Oil in-kind.  Beginning February 1, 2018, the government of Gabon elected to take its Profit Oil in-kind with the only lifting made in September 2018. 
 EMPLOYEES
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 108 full-time employees, 75 of whom were located in Gabon. We are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements, although some of the national employees in Gabon are members of the NEOP (National Organization of Petroleum Workers) union. We believe relations with our employees are satisfactory. COMPETITION
 The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. Competition is particularly intense from other independent operators and from major oil and natural gas companies with respect to acquisitions and development of desirable oil and natural gas properties and licenses, and contracting for drilling equipment. There is also competition for the hiring of experienced personnel. In addition, the 

 
12

drilling, producing, processing and marketing of oil and natural gas is affected by a number of factors beyond our control which may delay drilling, increase prices and have other adverse effects which cannot be accurately predicted.
 Our competition for acquisitions, exploration, development and production includes the major oil and natural gas companies in addition to numerous independent oil companies, individual proprietors, investors and others. Many of these competitors have financial and technical resources and staff that are substantially larger than ours. As a result, our competitors may be able to pay more for desirable oil and natural gas assets, or to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and licenses than our financial or personnel resources will permit. Furthermore, these companies may also be better able to withstand the financial pressures of lower commodity prices, unsuccessful wells, volatility in financial markets and generally adverse global and industry-wide economic conditions. These companies may also be better able to absorb the burdens resulting from changes in relevant laws and regulations, which may adversely affect our competitive position. Our ability to generate reserves in the future will depend on our ability to select and acquire suitable producing properties and/or developing prospects for future drilling and exploration.
 INSURANCE 
 For protection against financial loss resulting from various operating hazards, we maintain insurance coverage, including insurance coverage for certain physical damage, blowout/control of a well, comprehensive general liability, worker’s compensation and employer’s liability. We maintain insurance at levels we believe to be customary in the industry to limit our financial exposure in the event of a substantial environmental claim resulting from sudden, unanticipated and accidental discharges of certain prohibited substances into the environment. Such insurance might not cover the complete claim amount and would not cover fines or penalties for a violation of environmental law. We are not fully insured against all risks associated with our business either because such insurance is unavailable or because premium costs are considered uneconomic. A material loss not fully covered by insurance could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. REGULATORY
 General
 Our operations and our ability to finance and fund our operations and growth are affected by political developments and laws and regulations in the areas in which we operate. In particular, oil and natural gas production operations and economics are affected by:
· | change in governments;
--+-----------------------


· | civil unrest;
--+--------------


· | price and currency controls;
--+-----------------------------


· | limitations on oil and natural gas production;
--+-----------------------------------------------


· | tax, environmental, safety and other laws relating to the petroleum industry;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | changes in laws relating to the petroleum industry;
--+----------------------------------------------------


· | changes in administrative regulations and the interpretation and application of administrative rules and regulations; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | changes in contract interpretation and policies of contract adherence.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

  In any country in which we may do business, the oil and natural gas industry legislation and agency regulation are periodically changed, sometimes retroactively, for a variety of political, economic, environmental and other reasons. Numerous governmental departments and agencies issue rules and regulations binding on the oil and natural gas industry, some of which carry substantial penalties for the failure to comply. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and our potential for economic loss.
 Gabon
 Our exploration and production activities offshore Gabon are subject to Gabonese regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Moreover, these laws and regulations could change in ways that could substantially increase our costs or affect our operations. The following is a summary of certain applicable regulatory frameworks in Gabon.
 In 2014, a new Hydrocarbons Law entered into force to regulate oil and gas activities in Gabon. It repealed some prior laws relating to oil activities as well as all contradictory regulations contained in the remaining non-repealed laws of the oil and gas sector.
 Pursuant to the Hydrocarbons Law, petroleum resources in Gabon are the property of the Gabon and petroleum companies undertake operations on behalf of the Government of Gabon. In order to conduct petroleum operations, oil and gas companies must enter into a hydrocarbons agreement, typically an exploration and production sharing contract, which is signed on behalf of Gabon by the Minister in charge of Hydrocarbons and the Minister in charge of Economy. Such agreement is subject to enactment by Presidential Decree, and its provisions must conform to the Hydrocarbons Law, subject to being null and void. 
 Furthermore, under Article 260 of the 2014 Hydrocarbons Law, all oil and gas companies, even those carrying out operations under the previous legal framework, must make payment of two financial contributions set forth in the new Hydrocarbons Law, namely the Investment Diversification Fund (payment of 1% of the Contractor’s turnover during the production phase), and the Hydrocarbons 

 
13

Investment Fund (payment of 2% of the Contractor’s turnover during the production phase), within two years of the entry into force thereof. Under Article 260, oil and gas companies must also, within a maximum of one year from publication of the Hydrocarbons Law, set up and domicile the site rehabilitation funds for the Hydrocarbon activities at the Banque des Etats de l’Afrique Centrale or at a Gabonese banking or financial institution.
 The Hydrocarbons Law provides for a detailed legal framework in terms of organization of the sector, contents and terms and conditions of hydrocarbons agreements, liability, local content, safety and environment, domestic supply requirements, fiscal terms such as production sharing, royalty, bonuses and other charges, corporate income tax, customs, and local training obligations. 
 The powers to make many of the day-to-day decisions concerning petroleum activities, including the granting of certain consents and authorizations, remain vested with the Hydrocarbons General Directorate, a government authority. In addition, the national oil company—Société Nationale des Hydrocarbures du Gabon—currently holds, manages and takes participations in petroleum activities on behalf of Gabon. Pursuant to Article 4 of the Hydrocarbons Law, Gabon may acquire an equity stake of up to 20%, at market value, within any companies applying for or already holding an exclusive production authorization. The contractor must carry Gabon in its 20% participating interest in the hydrocarbons agreements during the exploration phase. The parties are free to agree on a higher stake at market value. Further, under Article 86 of the Hydrocarbons Law, the national oil company may also acquire participating interests of up to 15%, at market value. 
 In addition to general labor regulations, which require that the workforce of any company in Gabon complies with a 90/10 ratio of Gabon national to foreign expatriate workers, pursuant to the Hydrocarbons Law, subcontracting activities are awarded in priority to Gabonese companies in which at least 80% of the workforce consists of Gabonese nationals. In this respect, only technically qualified license holders may be hired as subcontractors. 
 Under the 2014 Hydrocarbons Law, assignment of interests in production sharing contracts is subject to the Ministry of Hydrocarbons’ consent and to Gabon’s preemption rights. Foreign companies carrying out production activities under the form of a local branch must incorporate a local company within two years of the entry into force of the Hydrocarbons Law under its Article 254.
 With respect to natural gas, Gabon shall enjoy exclusive marketing rights for non-associated gas while any non-commercial share of associated natural gas remains the property of Gabon. 
 Hydrocarbons agreements entered into prior to the Hydrocarbon Law’s publication remain in force until their expiration and should continue to be governed by their own provisions. Our understanding is that the Hydrocarbons Law applies to any issues not expressly dealt with in these contracts’ provisions. 
 Our production sharing contract governing our rights to the Etame Marin block offshore Gabon was entered into before the publication of the Hydrocarbon Law. The Etame PSC contains a stabilization clause, which provides for the stability of the legal, tax, economic and financial conditions in force at the signing of the Etame PSC. Pursuant to the Etame PSC, these conditions may not be adversely altered during the term of the agreement; however, we can make no assurance that the interpretation of the Hydrocarbon Law will not adversely affect our operations or assets in Gabon. 
 As discussed in “— Segment and Geographic Information—Gabon Segment—Offshore – Etame Marin Block—Production,” production from the Etame block is stored in an FPSO which we lease from a third party.  Over the past 15 years, this vessel was imported under a temporary import license.  In November 2018, a permanent import license for the FPSO was issued.    ﻿
 Equatorial Guinea
 ﻿
 Our exploration and production activities in Equatorial Guinea are subject to the applicable regulations of the country. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Moreover, these laws and regulations could change in ways that could substantially increase our costs or affect our operations. The following is a summary of certain applicable regulatory frameworks in Equatorial Guinea.
 ﻿
 All hydrocarbons existing in Equatorial Guinea’s onshore territory, as well as in its sovereign and jurisdictional waters, are Gabon property and part of the public domain. The monetization of such hydrocarbons is to be pursued exclusively by Gabon under its constitution, which reserves the exploitation of mineral and hydrocarbons resources exclusively to Gabon and the public sector. However, the constitution also provides that Gabon can delegate to, grant a concession to or associate itself with private parties for purposes of exploration and production activities in the manner and cases set forth by law.
 ﻿
 Private oil companies have been allowed to conduct petroleum operations in Equatorial Guinea through PSCs signed by the minister responsible for petroleum operations on behalf of Gabon. PSCs are subject to ratification by the President of the Republic and become effective only on the date the contractor is notified of presidential ratification. The powers to sign and amend PSCs and supervise their performance belong to the ministry responsible for petroleum operations.  In addition, GEPetrol, holds, manages and takes participations in petroleum activities on behalf of Gabon.
 ﻿
 In 2006, the Parliament of Equatorial Guinea passed a new hydrocarbons law (“2006 Hydrocarbons Law”) which superseded the previous 1981 Hydrocarbons Law, as amended in 2000, incorporating not only the regime applicable to the exploration, appraisal, development and production of hydrocarbons, but also rules on their transportation, distribution, storage, preservation, 

 
14

decommissioning, refining, marketing, sale and other disposal. The 2006 Hydrocarbons Law contains provisions on a number of aspects concerning exploration and production operations and contracts, such as national content obligations, unitization, transfers and abandonment. The 2006 Hydrocarbons Law has increased the Gabon’s benefits under exploration and production contracts and, to a certain extent, has reduced the ability of the minister responsible for petroleum operations to negotiate some contractual terms (e.g. by imposing minimum royalties of 13%).
 ﻿
 The 2006 Hydrocarbons Law expressly repeals any conflicting provisions of equal or lower standing, in particular the 1981 Hydrocarbons Law, and provides that all petroleum operations are subject thereto. However, the 2006 Hydrocarbons Law does not amend any conflicting clauses of existing PSCs which continue to govern the performance of petroleum operations.  In 2013, the 2006 Hydrocarbons Law was complemented by the Petroleum Regulations, which address in further detail a broad range of matters concerning upstream, midstream and downstream activities. 
 ﻿
 The Block P PSC was entered into before the publication of the 2006 Hydrocarbons Law and Petroleum Regulations. The Etame PSC contains a stabilization clause, whereby in case the economic balance of Gabon or the contractor under the Etame PSC is materially altered as a result of any change in laws, orders or regulations in Equatorial Guinea, the parties should make the necessary adjustments to the relevant provisions to the Etame PSC, observing the principle that the affected party should be restored to substantially the same economic conditions if such changes had not occurred.   However, we can make no assurance that the interpretation of the 2006 Hydrocarbons Law or Petroleum Regulations will not adversely affect our operations or assets in Equatorial Guinea.
 ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS
 General
 Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws and regulations, including laws and regulations in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection or pollution control. The cost of compliance could be significant. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial and damage payment obligations, or the issuance of injunctive relief (including orders to cease operations). Environmental laws and regulations are complex and have tended to become more stringent over time. We also are subject to various environmental permit requirements. Some environmental laws and regulations may impose strict liability, which could subject us to liability for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or for conduct or conditions caused by prior operators or third parties. To the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that prohibits or restricts drilling or imposes environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to the oil and natural gas industry in general, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.  Although no assurances can be made, we believe that, absent the occurrence of an extraordinary event, compliance with existing laws, rules and regulations regulating the release of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment will not have a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position with respect to our existing assets and operations. We cannot predict, however, what effect future environmental regulation or legislation, enforcement policies, or claims for damages to property, employees, other persons, the environment or natural resources could have on us.
 In addition, a number of governmental bodies have adopted, have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to the potential impact of climate change and to the lobbying effects of various climate change non-governmental organizations. Legislation and increased regulation regarding climate change could impose significant costs on us, our venture joint owners, and our suppliers, including costs related to increased energy requirements, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting, and other costs to comply with such regulations.  Given the political significance and uncertainty around the impact of climate change and how it should be dealt with, we cannot predict how legislation and regulation will affect our financial condition and operating performance. In addition, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about potential impacts on climate change by us or other companies in our industry could harm our reputation or impact the marketability of oil and natural gas. The potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and would be particular to the geographic circumstances in areas in which we operate. These may include changes in rainfall and storm patterns and intensities, water shortages, changing sea levels, and changing temperatures. These impacts may adversely impact the cost, production, and financial performance of our operations.
 In part because they are developing countries, it is unclear how quickly and to what extent Gabon or Equatorial Guinea will increase their regulation of environmental issues in the future; any significant increase in the regulation or enforcement of environmental issues by Gabon or Equatorial Guinea could have a material effect on us. Developing countries, in certain instances, have patterned environmental laws after those in the U.S., which are discussed below. However, the extent to which any environmental laws are enforced in developing countries varies significantly.
 With regards to our development operations offshore West Africa, we are a member of Oil Spill Response Limited (OSRL), a global emergency and oil spill-response organization headquartered in London. OSRL has aircraft and equipment available for dispersant application or equipment transport, including active recovery boom systems and other booms that can be used for offshore or shoreline responses.  In addition, OSRL can provide communications equipment, safety equipment, transfer pumps, dispersant application systems, temporary storage equipment, generators, boats and vessels and oiled wildlife equipment.  
 See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion on the impact of these and other regulations relating to environmental protection.

Environmental Regulations in the U.S.
 Currently, we conduct no operations in the U.S. and have only inconsequential interests in two U.S. properties.   However, our prior operations in the U.S., and any future operations we may conduct in the U.S., may subject us to certain liabilities under U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations.  In the U.S., environmental laws and regulations are administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and counterpart state agencies.  
 These U.S. laws and regulations, as well as state counterparts, generally restrict the level of pollutants emitted to ambient air, discharges to surface water, and disposals or other releases to surface and below-ground soils and ground water. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil, and criminal penalties; the imposition of investigatory, remedial, and corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures; delays in the permitting, development, or expansion of projects; and the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting some or all of our activities in a particular area. Moreover, multiple environmental laws provide for citizen suits, which allow environmental organizations to act in the place of the government and sue operators for alleged violations of environmental law. 
 Some of our prior operations on U.S. onshore properties involved hydraulic fracturing activities associated with drilling in shale formations. Hydraulic fracturing has been increasingly the subject of significant focus among many non-governmental organizations and regulators. Hydraulic fracturing requires the use and disposal of water, and public concern has been growing over its possible effects on drinking water supplies, as well as the adequacy of both water supply sources and disposal methods.
 Superfund
 The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the “Superfund” law, generally imposes joint and several liability for costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damages, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons with respect to the release into the environment of substances designated under CERCLA as hazardous substances (“Hazardous Substances”). These classes of persons, or so-called potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”), include the current and certain past owners and operators of a facility where there has been a release or threat of release of a Hazardous Substance and persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of Hazardous Substances found at a facility. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some cases, third parties to take actions in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the PRPs the costs of such action.
 Although CERCLA generally exempts “petroleum” from the definition of a Hazardous Substance, in the course of our prior U.S. operations, we may have generated substances that may fall within CERCLA’s definition of a “Hazardous Substance” and may have disposed of these substances at disposal sites owned and operated by others. Also, properties that we own and properties that we may have owned or operated may have been sites on which Hazardous Substances have been released. To our knowledge, neither we nor our predecessors have been designated as a PRP by the EPA under CERCLA; we also do not know of any prior owners or operators of its properties that are named as PRPs related to their ownership or operation of such properties. States such as Texas have comparable statutes which may cover substances (including petroleum) in addition to those covered under CERCLA. In the event soil or groundwater contamination is discovered at a site on which we have been an owner or operator or to which we sent regulated substances, we could be liable for costs of investigation and remediation and damages to natural resources.
 The Oil Pollution Act of 1990
 The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”), which amends and augments the oil spill provisions of the Clean Water Act (“CWA”) imposes certain duties and liabilities on certain “responsible parties” related to the prevention of oil spills and damages resulting from such spills in or threatening U.S. waters or adjoining shorelines. A liable “responsible party” includes the owner or operator of a facility, vessel or pipeline that is a source of an oil discharge or that poses the substantial threat of discharge, or in the case of offshore facilities, the lessee or permittee of the area in which a discharging facility is located. OPA assigns joint and several liability, without regard to fault, to each liable party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages. Although defenses exist to the liability imposed by OPA, they are limited. In the event of an oil discharge or substantial threat of discharge, we may be liable for costs and damages. The OPA also imposes ongoing requirements on a responsible party, including proof of financial responsibility to cover at least some costs in a potential spill.
 Other Environmental Regulation in the U.S. 
 In the past, we may have generated wastes, including hazardous wastes that are subject to the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes which may limit disposal options.  Although most oil and natural gas wastes are exempt from regulation as a hazardous waste under RCRA at the federal level, not all comparable state statutes have provided the same exemption, and certain wastes that we previously generated may have been subject to RCRA or comparable state statutes.
 The CWA and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge (including spills and leaks) of pollutants, including produced waters and other oil and natural gas wastes as well as fill materials, into state waters and waters of the U.S., a term broadly defined but which remains subject to litigation and rulemaking over its scope. 
 The Clear Air Act and analogous state laws govern emissions from sources of air pollution. These laws may require new and modified sources of air pollutants to obtain permits prior to commencing construction and may require the installation of stringent control methods.

The Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) was established to protect endangered and threatened species. Pursuant to that act, if a species is listed as threatened or endangered, restrictions may be imposed on activities adversely affecting that species’ habitat. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service could also result in further material restrictions to land use and may materially delay or prohibit land access for oil and natural gas development. 
 Most environmental laws and regulations provide for fines, penalties and injunctive relief for violations of their requirements. Some laws and regulations also provide for citizen suits, which allow a private citizen to sue to enforce the requirements of the applicable regulatory program.
