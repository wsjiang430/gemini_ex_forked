Overview
We are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of patients with cancer. Our first product approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), COSELA® (trilaciclib), is the first and only therapy indicated to proactively help protect bone marrow from the damage of chemotherapy (myeloprotection) and is the first innovation in managing myeloprotection in decades. In July 2022, COSELA (trilaciclib hydrochloride for injection) was conditionally approved by the China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) for marketing in China.
Trilaciclib was developed from a technology platform that targets key cellular pathways including transient arrest of the cell cycle at the G1 phase, prior to the beginning of DNA replication. Controlled administration and clean G1 arrest from transient CDK4/6 inhibition can protect bone marrow and reduce hematologic adverse events (“AEs”) caused by cytotoxic therapy and may increase the ability to receive longer treatment durations. Transient CDK4/6 inhibition also may improve survival in combination with leading and emerging treatments through myeloprotection, enabling increased cytotoxic exposure while protecting the immune system, and/or through immunomodulation, which may improve patients’ overall anti-tumor immune responses. We are exploring the use of trilaciclib in a variety of trials across multiple tumor types and treatment combinations to optimize these potential benefits of proactive multi-lineage myeloprotection and survival in combination with leading and emerging treatments for patients globally.
We use “COSELA” when referring to our FDA approved drug and “trilaciclib” when referring to our development of COSELA for additional indications. 
COSELA is a prescription medicine used to help reduce the occurrence of low blood cell counts caused by damage to bone marrow from chemotherapy. COSELA is used to treat adults taking certain chemotherapies (platinum/etoposide or topotecan) for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.
COSELA is an injection for intravenous (IV) use given within four hours before chemotherapy.
Commercial Product
On February 12, 2021, COSELA was approved by the FDA to decrease the incidence of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression in adult patients treated with a platinum/etoposide-containing regimen or topotecan-containing regimen for ES-SCLC. COSELA became commercially available through our specialty distributor network on March 2, 2021. 
We announced on March 25, 2021 that COSELA had been included in two updated National Comprehensive Cancer Network® (“NCCN”) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®): The Treatment Guidelines for Small Cell Lung Cancer and the Supportive Care Guidelines for Hematopoietic Growth Factors. These guidelines document evidence-based, consensus-driven management to ensure that all patients receive preventive, diagnostic, treatment, and supportive services that are most likely to lead to optimal outcomes. On October 1, 2021, we announced that the permanent J-code for COSELA that was issued in July 2021 by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is now effective for provider billing for all sites of care. All hospital outpatient departments, ambulatory surgery centers and physician offices in the United States have one consistent Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code to standardize the submission and payment of COSELA insurance claims across Medicare, Medicare Advantage, Medicaid and commercial plans. Our new technology add-on payment (NTAP) for COSELA which provides additional payment to inpatient hospitals above the standard Medicare Severity Diagnosis-Related Group (MS-DRG) payment amount also became effective for provider billing on October 1, 2021.

We are also exploring potential use of trilaciclib in a variety of tumors, including breast cancer, bladder cancer, and in trials designed to inform the design of future additional pivotal studies across multiple tumor types and treatment combinations including certain chemotherapies, checkpoint inhibitors, and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). 
In June 2020, we entered into a three-year co-promotion agreement for COSELA in the United States and Puerto Rico with Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Boehringer Ingelheim”). In December 2021, the Company and Boehringer Ingelheim mutually agreed to end the co-promotion agreement for COSELA, effective March 2022. At that time, we announced that we would hire and deploy a team of G1 oncology sales representatives to allow us to target all accounts to accelerate sales activities and help maximize the adoption of COSELA. As of February 21, 2022, all G1 sales representatives were hired, trained, and deployed into their respective regions. Starting from the second quarter of 2022, the sales of COSELA has been solely conducted by our COSELA sales team. 
On August 3, 2020, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Nanjing Simcere Dongyuan Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd (“Simcere”) for the development and commercialization of trilaciclib in all indications in Greater China (mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan). On July 13, 2022, the NMPA conditionally approved COSELA (trilaciclib hydrochloride for injection) for marketing in China. COSELA is indicated in China to decrease the incidence of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression in adult patients when administered prior to a platinum/etoposide-containing regimen for ES-SCLC. As a result of receiving approval in China, Simcere paid the Company a $13.0 million milestone (less applicable withholding taxes of $1.3 million) payment in the third quarter of 2022. In total, we may receive up to $156.0 million in milestone payments. We will also receive double-digit royalties on annual net sales of COSELA in China, of which there were none during the year ended December 31, 2022.
Product Portfolio
Trilaciclib is a first-in-class therapy designed to help protect against chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression. Trilaciclib, a novel transient IV CDK4/6 inhibitor has unique attributes including rapid onset from IV administration, potent and selective CDK4 and CDK6 inhibition and a short half-life. Controlled administration and clean G1-phase arrest reduce hematologic AEs caused by cytotoxic therapy and may increase patients’ abilities to receive longer treatment durations. Transient CDK4/6 inhibition also modulates multiple immune functions ("immunomodulation") while allowing beneficial T cell proliferation which may improve patients’ anti-tumor immune responses.
Trilaciclib transiently blocks progression through the cell cycle. This provides benefits which manifest depending on the tumor type and therapeutic backbone, including: (1) proactive multi-lineage myeloprotection to protect the bone marrow from cytotoxic damage, and (2) potentially improved survival in combination with leading and emerging treatments.
We are pursuing trilaciclib across key growth platforms. First, trilaciclib provides proactive multi-lineage myeloprotection by transiently arresting hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (“HSPCs”), helping to protect them from damage caused by cytotoxic therapy thereby minimizing cytopenias across neutrophils, erythrocytes, and platelets. These proactive multi-lineage myeloprotection benefits were seen in our three Phase 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in ES-SCLC, where highly myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimens are administered multiple days in a row. In addition, these proactive multilineage myeloprotection benefits were seen in the initial data from the Phase 2 trial of trilaciclib in combination with the antibody-drug conjugate, sacituzumab govitecan-hziy in patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Initial data on the first 18 patients showed a clinically meaningful on-target effect of trilaciclib to reduce (>50%) the rates of multiple adverse events compared to the previously published sacituzumab govitecan-hziy single agent safety profile from the ASCENT trial, including myelosuppression (neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia). 

Second, trilaciclib has the potential to improve survival in combination with leading and emerging treatments through two key benefits, including (1) myeloprotection, which may allow increased cytotoxic exposure while protecting the immune system, and/or (2) immunomodulation, which can improve the overall immune response. The immunomodulation properties of trilaciclib is believed to occur through multiple factors, including (1) enhancing T cell activation (via increased antigen presentation and secretion of IL-2 and IFNγ), (2) favorably altering the tumor microenvironment (via increased chemokines responsible for trafficking T cells to tumors and reducing the number and function of immunosuppressive cell populations), and (3) improving long-term immune surveillance (via increased generation of memory CD8+ T cells). We are exploring these potential survival benefits of trilaciclib in a variety of ongoing Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials. A meaningful anti-tumor efficacy benefit was observed in our Phase 2 mTNBC study in which trilaciclib led to a significant improvement in overall survival (OS) when administered in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine/carboplatin) compared to chemotherapy alone. These are the foundational data for our ongoing PRESERVE 2 pivotal Phase 3 trial in 1L mTNBC. 
We are evaluating the potential benefits of trilaciclib across a variety of treatment settings and potential combinations to maximize the applicability of the drug to potential future treatment paradigms. We currently have four ongoing clinical trials: a pivotal Phase 3 trial in 1L mTNBC, a Phase 2 trial in combination with an antibody-drug conjugate (“ADC”) in 2L/3L mTNBC, a Phase 2 trial in neoadjuvant TNBC designed to validate trilaciclib’s immune-based mechanism of action (“MOA”), and a Phase 2 trial in 1L bladder cancer with chemotherapy induction and a checkpoint inhibitor maintenance. These studies will evaluate trilaciclib’s benefits of myeloprotection and/or immunomodulation to improve anti-tumor efficacy in combination with leading and emerging treatment options. We are also conducting significant preclinical work to assess the additive/synergistic potential of trilaciclib with a variety of novel and emerging therapeutic agents to inform future clinical trials. New non-clinical data presented in September 2022 showed consistent synergistic potential of trilaciclib to enhance the cancer immunity cycle by enhancing T cell activation, favorably altering the tumor microenvironment, and improving long-term surveillance. Our overall development approach includes monitoring and anticipating the evolving future standards of care across tumor types to design or support studies that will generate important data for trilaciclib across relevant future treatment settings and maximize future usage. 
In November 2022, we disclosed encouraging initial data from our ongoing Phase 2 trial of trilaciclib in combination with the ADC, sacituzumab govitecan-hziy. Initial data demonstrate the potential for an on-target effect of trilaciclib to meaningfully reduce the rates of adverse events associated with sacituzumab govitecan-hziy, including myelosuppression, diarrhea, and potentially alopecia (due to the presence of CDK4/6-expressing cells in the intestinal crypt and hair follicles) compared to the previously published sacituzumab govitecan-hziy single agent safety profile. We expect to release a more comprehensive data set including safety and initial efficacy results in the second quarter of 2023.
In December 2022, we reported data at the annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS) from the initial dose finding Phase 2 portion of the MOA trial, a multicenter, open-label, single-arm, neoadjuvant study where tumor tissue was obtained at baseline prior to study drug administration. Initial results from the first 24 patients show favorable alterations in the tumor microenvironment from a single dose of trilaciclib monotherapy (240 mg/m2) as measured by increases in the proportions of CD8+ T cells compared to T regulatory cells (Tregs) in patients with early-stage TNBC. No trilaciclib related serious adverse events have been reported. We expect the pathologic complete response data to be available in the second quarter of 2023.
In January 2023, we provided an initial update on PRESERVE 3, the ongoing, randomized, open-label Phase 2 study of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy and maintenance therapy with the immune checkpoint inhibitor, avelumab, administered alone, or in combination with trilaciclib, in patients with untreated, locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (“mUC”). The confirmed overall response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1 was comparable between arms and we believe that longer-term follow-up is required to characterize additional anti-tumor endpoints including median duration of confirmed objective response and progression-free survival (PFS). Additional data, including the primary endpoint of PFS, are anticipated in mid-2023.

On February 13, 2023, we announced top line results from our pivotal Phase 3 PRESERVE 1 trial showing that the trial achieved its co-primary endpoints related to severe neutropenia with statistical significance, including clinically meaningful and statistically significant reductions in both occurrence of severe neutropenia during induction (placebo=20% vs. trilaciclib=1%; p<0.001) and mean duration of severe neutropenia in Cycles 1 through 4 (placebo=1.3 days vs. trilaciclib=0.1 days; p<0.001). Patients receiving trilaciclib experienced fewer chemotherapy dose reductions and delays. Other secondary measures of myeloprotection also favored trilaciclib, including reductions in Febrile Neutropenia (placebo=5% vs. trilaciclib=0%) and ESA administration (placebo=7% vs. trilaciclib=3%). These results further validate the myeloprotection benefit of trilaciclib. In addition, patients receiving trilaciclib had a clinically meaningful reduction in the rate of chemotherapy-induced diarrhea, including a 50% reduction in the rate of Grade 3/4 diarrhea and a 30% reduction in the rate of any grade diarrhea, compared to placebo. 
However, despite the achievement of the co-primary endpoints and other secondary measures of myeloprotection and tolerability, early anti-tumor efficacy data, including overall response rate (ORR), favor patients receiving placebo compared to trilaciclib (61% and 50% ORRs, respectively). Given the differential in these anti-tumor efficacy metrics and the low likelihood of achieving the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) endpoints, we have made the decision to discontinue PRESERVE 1. Other clinical trials of trilaciclib in combination with different chemotherapies in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer and triple negative breast cancer did not demonstrate this adverse survival signal.

*Initial results expected: Phase 3 1L mTNBC trial: interim OS analysis; if the trial meets the interim analysis stopping rule, it will terminate and we will report the topline results. If it does not, the trial will continue to the final analysis

1L Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (mTNBC)
Building upon the robust OS benefit observed in the prior Phase 2 study, we initiated PRESERVE 2, a pivotal Phase 3 trial of trilaciclib in patients receiving first-line gemcitabine and carboplatin (GC) for locally advanced unresectable or mTNBC; enrollment was completed in this trial in October 2022. This study is evaluating trilaciclib in PD-L1 positive and negative patients and largely replicates the design of the positive Phase 2 trial which demonstrated improved anti-tumor efficacy across patients. Anti-tumor efficacy and myeloprotection endpoints are being assessed in this study. We broadened enrollment of the 1L cohort in this study to also include patients who received checkpoint inhibitors in the neo/adjuvant setting to ensure that we develop clinical experience for trilaciclib in this increasingly relevant patient population. 
An interim overall survival (OS) analysis at 70% of events is currently anticipated in the first half of 2024 to evaluate the effect of trilaciclib on overall survival in patients with TNBC when administered prior to treatment with GC. If the OS analysis achieves the threshold of statistical significance at this interim assessment, the trial will be terminated, and the data will be reported. In that event, we would discuss the data with regulatory health authorities regarding filing for potential approval of this indication.
Phase 2 Study of Trilaciclib in Combination with an Antibody-Drug Conjugate (ADC) 
Triple negative breast cancer (“TNBC”) is an area where trilaciclib, in our Phase 2 study, and ADCs – medicines that deliver targeted chemotherapy agents to cancer cells – have both shown clinically meaningful and substantial improvements in overall survival. We believe that trilaciclib and ADCs could act synergistically to improve patient outcomes with fewer myelosuppressive side effects. 
In November 2022, we disclosed encouraging initial safety and tolerability data from our ongoing Phase 2 trial of trilaciclib in combination with the ADC, sacituzumab govitecan-hziy. Initial data demonstrate the potential for an on-target effect of trilaciclib to meaningfully reduce the rates of adverse events associated with sacituzumab govitecan-hziy, including myelosuppression, diarrhea, and potentially alopecia (due to the presence of CDK4/6-expressing cells in the intestinal crypt and hair follicles) compared to the previously published sacituzumab govitecan-hziy single agent safety profile. Additional data from this trial are expected in the second quarter of 2023 and will include anti-tumor efficacy endpoints as measured by the primary endpoint of PFS.
Phase 2 Study to Confirm the Immune-Based Mechanism of Action (MOA) of Trilaciclib
In December 2022, we provided initial results from 24 patients with early-stage TNBC receiving neoadjuvant treatment enrolled in the Phase 2 study of trilaciclib and chemotherapy, a multicenter, open-label, single-arm, study, to evaluate and confirm the immune-based mechanism of action (“MOA”) of trilaciclib. 
Tumor tissue was obtained at baseline prior to study drug administration with patients receiving a single dose of trilaciclib monotherapy (240 mg/m2), followed by a tumor biopsy approximately one week later to assess the ability of trilaciclib to favorably alter the tumor microenvironment. Patients then entered the treatment phase in which trilaciclib is administered on day 1 of each cycle of anthracycline/cyclophosphamide for four cycles followed by trilaciclib administered on day 1 of each weekly cycle of taxane chemotherapy for 12 cycles. Pembrolizumab and/or carboplatin was added at the discretion of the investigator. Three to five weeks after the treatment phase, patients will have curative surgery and a final tumor tissue sample will be collected if the patient has residual disease. The primary objective is to evaluate the immune-based mechanism of action of a single dose of trilaciclib as measured by the change in the ratio of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) to Tregs in the tumor microenvironment. 
Initial results presented in a poster session at the annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS) in December 2022 show favorable alterations in the tumor microenvironment from a single dose of trilaciclib monotherapy as measured by increases in the proportions of CD8+ T cells compared to T regulatory cells (Tregs) in patients with early-stage TNBC. The improvement of the ratio of CD8+ T cells to Tregs may enhance the overall anti-tumor immune response and support the trends we observed in preclinical studies and in our Phase 2 trial in TNBC. No trilaciclib related serious adverse events have been reported. We anticipate the pathologic complete response (pCR) data to be available in the second quarter of 2023. 

1L Bladder Cancer 
In January 2023, we provided an initial update on PRESERVE 3, an ongoing, randomized, open-label Phase 2 study of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy and maintenance therapy with the immune checkpoint inhibitor, avelumab, administered alone, or in combination with trilaciclib, in patients with untreated, locally advanced or mUC. Ninety-two patients with mUC were randomized (1:1) to receive either gercitabine/platinum chemotherapy (induction phase) followed by avelumab (checkpoint inhibitor) maintenance therapy (maintenance phase) or trilaciclib prior to gercitabine/platinum chemotherapy followed by trilaciclib plus avelumab maintenance therapy. 
The confirmed ORR per RECIST v1.1 was comparable between arms with ORR being 40.0% (n=18/45) and 46.7% (n=21/45) among evaluable patients in the trilaciclib and control arms, respectively. We believe that longer-term follow-up is required to characterize additional anti-tumor endpoints including median duration of response and PFS. Though early, the safety and tolerability profile of trilaciclib administered prior to chemotherapy is generally consistent with that expected in patients treated with gemcitabine plus cisplatin/carboplatin and avelumab maintenance for previously untreated advanced or mUC. The data monitoring committee reviews the safety of trilaciclib on an ongoing basis and recommended that the study continue as planned. Additional safety and efficacy data, including the primary endpoint of PFS, are anticipated mid-2023. 
Investigator Sponsored Studies (ISS) Program
The Company has an Investigator Sponsored Studies (“ISS”) program. An ISS is a study that is developed and conducted by a qualified physician investigator external to the Company who assumes full responsibility for the conduct of the study. An ISS can take a variety of forms including clinical and nonclinical studies that may be interventional or observational. Our ISS program supports studies that align with our areas of scientific interest. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company announced that we were supporting a new Phase 2 ISS of trilaciclib and lurbinectedin in patients with ES-SCLC. This is a prospective, non-randomized, single-arm Phase 2 study, to evaluate trilaciclib administered intravenously prior to lurbinectedin in approximately 30 subjects with platinum refractory ES-SCLC. The primary endpoint is the rate of grade 4 neutropenia in any cycle. Secondary endpoints include mean duration (days) of grade 4 neutropenia in cycle 1, overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), overall rate of response (ORR), quality of life assessments, and the use of secondary/reactive supportive measures including G-CSF administration.
Market opportunities for trilaciclib
Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States with an estimated 1.9 million new cases and 609,000 deaths in 2022, according to the American Cancer Society. Cytotoxic therapies (chemotherapies, antibody-drug conjugates, others) are the standard of care treatment for multiple cancers. 
Myelosuppression is a common serious adverse event related to cytotoxic therapies. These treatments have significant clinical utility and continue to be the most effective treatment for many cancers. However, cytotoxic therapies also damage HSPCs (myelosuppression) and the immune system (immunosuppression), leading to severe adverse effects and limiting anti-tumor activity. Myelosuppression causes abnormally low numbers of red blood cells, or anemia, abnormally low numbers of neutrophils, or neutropenia, and/or abnormally low numbers of platelets, or thrombocytopenia. Treating or preventing the myelosuppressive side effects of cytotoxic therapy presents a large market opportunity, with chemotherapy utilized in more than one million patients in North America annually, and newer cytotoxic agents such as ADCs continuing to demonstrate benefits in expanding patient populations. The only current treatments for chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression are rescue interventions like growth factors and/or transfusions given after myelosuppression occurs. COSELA is the only product approved to proactively prevent chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression and we continue to evaluate the utility of trilaciclib to prevent myelosuppression in clinical trials with existing and newer cytotoxic therapies.

Additionally, significant unmet medical need continues to exist for products that can meaningfully improve the anti-tumor efficacy of existing and emerging standard of care therapies. Despite continued advancements of new treatment modalities, additional novel therapies are needed to further improve anti-tumor efficacy, including in combination with newer agents. Trilaciclib is a novel compound with the potential to meaningfully improve anti-tumor efficacy across tumor types when administered in treatment combinations. We are studying trilaciclib broadly in multiple Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials to evaluate its potential to improve anti-tumor efficacy and reduce adverse events commonly associated with cytotoxic therapies:
•Extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). According to the American Cancer Society, SCLC accounts for approximately 10-15% of all lung cancers. Approximately 27,000 people are treated annually in the United States for ES-SCLC in first and second line. First-line treatment of ES-SCLC in the United States is typically a chemotherapy regimen of carboplatin and etoposide, which has significant myelosuppressive side effects. Combination treatment with chemotherapy and immunotherapy has emerged as the standard of care in the United States. While these patients often respond to first-line therapy, approximately 90% progress within one year and die within two years. Five-year survival rates are less than 5% for patients with ES-SCLC. Topotecan, approved for SCLC in 2007, is a standard treatment used in the second/third line setting and is highly myelosuppressive. Based on market research we have completed to date, many physicians see proactive myeloprotection as a better approach for patients and would incorporate trilaciclib into their SCLC treatment regimen. We believe the total market value of the trilaciclib opportunity for all eligible ES-SCLC patients in the U.S. exceeds $700 million. 
•Breast cancer. We are evaluating the use of trilaciclib in a variety of breast cancers, including metastatic triple negative breast cancer (mTNBC) and other high-risk, early-stage breast cancer subtypes. According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 2.3 million cases of breast cancer are diagnosed annually worldwide. In 2022, it is estimated that 43,250 women and 530 men died of breast cancer. Triple negative breast cancer makes up approximately 15-20% of such diagnosed breast cancers. Because mTNBC cells lack key growth-signaling receptors, patients do not respond well to medications that block estrogen, progesterone, or HER2 receptors. Instead, treating mTNBC typically involves chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery. In general, survival rates tend to be lower with mTNBC compared to other forms of breast cancer, and mTNBC is also more likely to return after it has been treated, especially in the first few years after treatment.
•Bladder cancer. We are evaluating the use of trilaciclib in bladder cancer in a Phase 2 study that initiated in the second quarter of 2021. There have been multiple positive registrational studies and approvals of checkpoint inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy, and these combination regimens are emerging as a standard of care in multiple tumor types. Data from our trial of trilaciclib in combination with the checkpoint inhibitor Tecentriq® (atezolizumab) and chemotherapy in patients with ES-SCLC showed myeloprotection benefits without impairing anti-tumor efficacy. This Phase 2 trial in bladder cancer explores the use of trilaciclib in combination with chemotherapy for induction therapy and in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor for maintenance therapy. We believe trilaciclib may improve outcomes for these patients based on potentially synergistic benefits with both chemotherapy and immunotherapy. The American Cancer Society estimates that there will be over 82,000 new cases of bladder cancer diagnosed in the United States in 2023, and approximately 17,000 reported annual deaths. 

Advantages of trilaciclib
Trilaciclib is a novel transient IV CDK4/6 inhibitor with unique attributes including rapid onset from IV administration, potent and selective CDK4 and CDK6 inhibition and a short half-life. We believe that treating patients with trilaciclib prior to the administration of cytotoxic therapy or immunotherapy regimens may have the following benefits and advantages:
•Potential to decrease the incidence of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression. Trilaciclib has been rationally designed and optimized to preserve HSPCs from damage by cytotoxic therapy, thereby minimizing cytopenias across neutrophils, red cells, and platelets. Trilaciclib has the potential to decrease the clinically relevant consequences of these cytopenias and improve patient outcomes.
•Potential to reduce cytotoxic therapy dose-delays and dose reductions. Chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression is the major dose limiting toxicity of chemotherapy and can lead to dose reductions and schedule delays that can limit therapeutic benefit. Trilaciclib has been designed specifically to minimize myelosuppression and has the potential to enable maintenance of the indicated and planned chemotherapeutic dose and schedule.
•Potential to improve anti-tumor efficacy and prolong overall survival in treatment combinations. Trilaciclib has demonstrated the ability to improve anti-tumor efficacy and increase overall survival in our Phase 2 mTNBC study. Trilaciclib may increase patients’ ability to receive more cytotoxic therapy, protect their immune systems from damage by cytotoxic therapy, and improve their immune responses by modulating multiple immune functions while also allowing beneficial T cell proliferation. We are evaluating trilaciclib’s ability to improve anti-tumor efficacy across multiple tumor types and in various treatment combinations in ongoing clinical studies.
•Potential to improve the patient experience as measured by validated Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) instruments. PRO data from our randomized trials demonstrate that patients receiving trilaciclib prior to chemotherapy report less fatigue and improved physical and functional well-being.
•Potential for use with cytotoxic therapy / immune checkpoint inhibitors combinations. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are often combined with cytotoxic therapy. We have demonstrated that trilaciclib mitigates myelosuppression in ES-SCLC patients treated with chemotherapy in combination with the immune checkpoint inhibitor Tecentriq. Additionally, our preclinical data suggests there may be meaningful potential synergistic benefits in terms of anti-tumor efficacy when combining trilaciclib with checkpoint inhibitors in the appropriate treatment settings.
•Convenience of administration. Trilaciclib is designed to be administered via an IV infusion prior to chemotherapy treatment. This dosing regimen fits with standard clinical practice for chemotherapy administration with or without checkpoint inhibitors.
•Potential to reduce the cost of rescue interventions. Chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression leads to severe adverse side effects, such as fatigue due to anemia, infections due to neutropenia, and bleeding due to thrombocytopenia. These adverse side effects often require costly rescue interventions such as hospitalizations, transfusions, antibiotic usage and/or treatment with growth factor support. Because trilaciclib has been designed specifically to minimize myelosuppression, we believe that it has the potential to reduce these costs. The positive multilineage myeloprotection data we have reported to date and our market research with payers supports the value proposition of trilaciclib to reduce these costs.
•Potential broad applicability. We believe trilaciclib has the potential to benefit patients treated with multiple myelosuppressive cytotoxic regimens, including targeted chemotherapy (ADCs), across a wide range of tumor types.

Trilaciclib: preclinical and clinical development
Preclinical development
We have published extensive biochemical, cellular and in vivo data on trilaciclib. Our preclinical data show that trilaciclib can induce transient and reversible cell-cycle arrest of HSPCs; helps protect HSPCs from damage caused by chemotherapy; preserves bone marrow and immune system function; improves complete blood count (CBC) recovery; helps protect from bone marrow exhaustion; prevents myeloid skewing and consequent lymphopenia; activates T-cells in the tumor microenvironment; and enhances chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitor anti-tumor activity.
We are currently conducting extensive preclinical development work to assess the synergistic potential of trilaciclib with a variety of novel and emerging therapeutic agents to identify synergies to evaluate in future clinical trials.
Completed Phase 1 clinical trial
In 2015, we completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of trilaciclib in 45 healthy volunteers in the Netherlands. In this trial, subjects in seven cohorts were administered a single ascending dose of trilaciclib between 6 mg/m² and 192 mg/m². The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the safety including dose limiting toxicities, or DLTs, serious adverse events, or SAEs, adverse events, or AEs, and pharmacokinetics, or PK, and identify a biologically effective dose of trilaciclib. Published data from this trial demonstrated that trilaciclib was well tolerated, with no DLTs or SAEs reported. These data demonstrated that the administration of trilaciclib resulted in the robust cell-cycle arrest of HSPCs for at least 32 hours and supported a starting dose of 200 mg/m 2 for the initial studies in patients.

Phase 2 clinical program in SCLC (study 1 in package insert)
Based on the encouraging preliminary data, we advanced both SCLC trials into the randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 2 segment. Enrollment in the first-line SCLC Phase 2 trial was completed in the second quarter of 2017 and positive multilineage myeloprotection results were reported in March 2018, with additional data reported at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 2018 Congress and published in Annals of Oncology (Weiss et al.) in 2019. Enrollment in the second/third-line SCLC Phase 2 trial was completed in the second quarter of 2018, with positive multilineage myeloprotection data reported in the fourth quarter of 2018 and full data presented at an oral session at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2019 Annual Meeting. These data were also published in the International Journal of Cancer (Daniel et al.; 2020).

In December 2016, we entered into a non-exclusive agreement with Genentech to evaluate the combination of Genentech's immune checkpoint, anti-PD-L1 antibody Tecentriq with trilaciclib. Our first trial under the agreement was in first-line treatment for patients with ES-SCLC receiving carboplatin and etoposide. We initiated enrollment in this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial in the second quarter of 2017. The goals of the clinical trial were to evaluate the safety, OS, myeloprotection, PK, and anti-tumor activity of trilaciclib in combination with Tecentriq and chemotherapy. We completed enrollment in the first quarter of 2018. We reported positive multilineage myeloprotection data and preliminary progression free survival (PFS) in November 2018, and presented updated safety and anti-tumor efficacy data at the 2019 ESMO Congress.
Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in first-line treatment of SCLC (study 2 in package insert)
In 2015, we initiated a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in first-line ES-SCLC patients across multiple sites in the United States and Europe. The Phase 1b segment of the trial was designed to confirm the trilaciclib dose to be used in the randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 segment. The goals of the trial were to evaluate the safety, myeloprotection, pharmacokinetics, and anti-tumor activity of trilaciclib in combination with the existing first-line chemotherapy standard of care regimen of etoposide and carboplatin and to confirm the dose to be used in future trials. All patients in the Phase 1b segment were administered three-week cycles of trilaciclib plus etoposide/carboplatin, with an estimated four to six cycles administered in total per patient based on historical practice. Trilaciclib was administered as an IV infusion prior to every dose of etoposide/carboplatin.
In the Phase 1b section of this trial, as reported at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in June 2017, we treated 19 patients with multiple cycles of trilaciclib and chemotherapy and did not have a single episode of febrile neutropenia – one of the most common adverse consequences of these chemotherapy regimens. We also observed a dose dependent reduction in grade 3/4 hematologic adverse events. The results from the Phase 1b study support the hypothesis that trilaciclib could ameliorate the significant acute and long-term consequences of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression by preserving hematopoietic and immune system function. Based on these results, we initiated the randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 segment of the trial in fourth-quarter of 2016 with a trilaciclib dose of 240 mg/m2 and completed enrollment of a total of 77 patients in the second quarter of 2017. We reported positive multilineage myeloprotection data from the Phase 2 segment of the trial in March 2018, with additional data from the trial presented at the 2018 ESMO Congress and final data published in Annals of Oncology (Weiss et al.; 2019). 
Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in second/third-line treatment of SCLC (study 3 in package insert)
In 2015, we initiated a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in second/third-line SCLC patients across multiple sites in the United States and Europe. The Phase 1b segment of the trial was designed to confirm the trilaciclib dose to be used in the randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 segment of the trial. The goals of the trial were to evaluate the safety, myeloprotection, PK, and anti-tumor activity of trilaciclib in combination with the existing second/third-line chemotherapy standard of care regimen of topotecan and to confirm the dose to be used in future trials. All patients in the Phase 1b segment were administered three-week cycles of trilaciclib plus topotecan until the progression of disease. Trilaciclib was administered as an IV infusion prior to every dose of topotecan. Trilaciclib doses of 200 to 280 mg/m2 and topotecan doses of 0.75 to 1.5 mg/m2 were tested across 7 cohorts in the completed Phase 1b open-label segment of the trial. The doses chosen for the randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 segment of this trial were trilaciclib 240 mg/m2 + topotecan 0.75 mg/m2 and trilaciclib 240 mg/m2 + topotecan 1.5 mg/m2. 
In the Phase 1b segment we treated 32 patients with trilaciclib and topotecan without any episodes of febrile neutropenia or treatment related SAEs. Preliminary results from Phase 1b were reported at the IASCLC World Conference on Lung Cancer in December 2016. Based on these results, the Phase 2 segment was initiated in the first quarter of 2017 and consists of a double blind-design with 91 patients randomized on a 2:1 basis to receive trilaciclib plus topotecan, or placebo plus topotecan. We completed enrollment in this trial in the second quarter of 2018 and reported multilineage myeloprotection data in the fourth quarter of 2018. Safety and anti-tumor efficacy data were presented at the 2019 ASCO Annual Meeting. These data were published in the 2019 Advanced in Therapy (Hart et al.; 2020).

Our double-blind placebo controlled trials of trilaciclib in SCLC trials demonstrated that, when added to standard of care chemotherapy or chemotherapy/checkpoint inhibitor regimens, trilaciclib mitigates clinically significant chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for trilaciclib based on myeloprotection data from our three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled SCLC clinical trials, as well as safety data collected across all completed and ongoing clinical trials. The Breakthrough Therapy program is designed to expedite development and review of drugs intended for serious or life-threatening conditions. In August 2020, the FDA accepted our New Drug Application (NDA) for trilaciclib in SCLC, granting Priority Review with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date of February 15, 2021. COSELA™ (trilaciclib) was approved by the FDA on February 12, 2021 to decrease the incidence of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression in adult patients when administered prior to a platinum/etoposide-containing regimen or topotecan-containing regimen for ES-SCLC. Discussions with European regulatory authorities have indicated existing data is sufficient to support a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for trilaciclib for myeloprotection in SCLC, which we plan to pursue in collaboration with a partner.
Phase 2 clinical trial in metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer (mTNBC)
In January 2017, we initiated an open label, randomized, Phase 2 trial that enrolled 102 patients with first, second or third-line mTNBC across multiple sites in the United States and Europe. The goals of the clinical trial are to evaluate the safety, myeloprotection, PK, and anti-tumor activity of trilaciclib in combination with the existing chemotherapy standard of care regimen of gemcitabine and carboplatin (GC). We completed enrollment in the second quarter of 2018. At the December 2018 SABCS, we presented preliminary data demonstrating improvement in progression-free survival (PFS). We presented additional safety and anti-tumor efficacy data at the 2019 ESMO Congress. The results of the trial demonstrated significant improvement in overall survival (OS) (preliminary). Though the trial did not meet the primary myeloprotection endpoint, patients receiving trilaciclib were able to receive ~50% more cycles of chemo, without additional hematological toxicity. These data were presented at the 2019 ESMO Congress and concurrently published in The Lancet Oncology (Tan et al.; 2019). Updated safety and efficacy data from this trial were presented at the 2020 SABCS. Data included that compared to GC alone (Group 1), OS was improved in both trilaciclib arms (Groups 2 and 3) (Group 2: HR=0.31, p=0.0016; Group 3: HR=0.40, p=0.0004). Median OS was 12.6 months in Group 1, not reached for Group 2, and 17.8 months in Group 3. The median OS for Groups 2 and 3 combined was 19.8 months (HR=0.37, p<0.0001). OS findings in patients receiving trilaciclib were consistent with previously reported data from this trial. The median OS for GC alone (Group 1, 12.6 months) was consistent with the previous trial findings and historical data. Patients with both PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative tumors treated with trilaciclib and GC demonstrated improvement in OS compared to patients receiving GC alone, with the PD-L1-positive subset achieving statistically significant improvement. Further, data from T cell clonality analyses suggest that administering trilaciclib prior to chemotherapy enhanced immune system function.
Phase 3 clinical trial in metastatic colorectal cancer (PRESERVE 1) - Trial discontinued
PRESERVE 1 was a randomized, placebo-controlled registrational trial of trilaciclib in colorectal cancer (“CRC”). CRC is a large indication commonly treated with 5-FU-based chemotherapy. We have extensive preclinical research demonstrating myeloprotection in 5-FU-based regimens with trilaciclib. PRESERVE 1 evaluated trilaciclib administered in combination with the triplet therapy FOLFOXIRI (5-FU, folinic acid, oxaliplatin and irinotecan) and bevacizumab, which is the most efficacious chemotherapy regimen for most 1L CRC tumors but also highly myelosuppressive compared to doublet therapies including FOLFOX or FOLFIRI. 
On February 13, 2023 , we announced topline results from our pivotal Phase 3 PRESERVE 1 trial showing that the trial achieved its co-primary endpoints related to severe neutropenia with statistical significance, including clinically meaningful and statistically significant reductions in both occurrence of severe neutropenia during induction (placebo=20% vs. trilaciclib=1%; p<0.001) and mean duration of severe neutropenia in Cycles 1 through 4 (placebo=1.3 days vs. trilaciclib=0.1 days; p<0.001). 
However, despite the achievement of the co-primary endpoints and other secondary measures of myeloprotection and tolerability, early anti-tumor efficacy data, including overall response rate (ORR), favor patients receiving placebo compared to trilaciclib (61% and 50% ORRs, respectively). Given the differential in these anti-tumor efficacy metrics and the low likelihood of achieving the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) endpoints, we have made the decision to discontinue PRESERVE 1. The Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) independently reached the same conclusion. 

Other clinical trials of trilaciclib in combination with different chemotherapies in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer and triple negative breast cancer did not demonstrate this adverse survival signal. 
Four ongoing clinical trials
Trilaciclib (IV CDK4/6 inhibitor):
Phase 3 clinical trial in first line Triple Negative Breast Cancer (PRESERVE 2)
Building upon the robust OS benefit observed in the prior Phase 2 study, in April 2021, we have completed enrollment in PRESERVE 2, a pivotal Phase 3 trial of trilaciclib in patients receiving first- or second-line gemcitabine and carboplatin chemotherapy (“GC”) for locally advanced unresectable or mTNBC. Anti-tumor efficacy and myeloprotection endpoints are being assessed in this study. The Phase 3 trial is being conducted across multiple sites in the United States and Europe. We have enrolled patients who previously received checkpoint inhibitors in the neo/adjuvant setting into the trial, to ensure that we develop clinical experience in this patient population. The primary endpoint is to evaluate the effect of trilaciclib on overall survival (OS) compared with placebo in patients receiving first-line GC. Key secondary endpoints include assessment of the effect of trilaciclib on patients’ quality of life compared with placebo. Enrollment in this trial is complete at 187 1L patients. The interim Overall Survival (OS) analysis at 70% of events is expected in the first half of 2024.
Phase 2 clinical trial in combination with the antibody-drug conjugate, Trodelvy® (Sacituzumab Govitecan-Hziy)
We initiated this ongoing Phase 2, single arm, open-label study of trilaciclib administered prior to the antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), Trodelvy® (sacituzumab govitecan-hziy) in patients with unresectable locally advanced or mTNBC in the fourth quarter of 2021. Anti-tumor efficacy and myeloprotective endpoints are being assessed. The primary objective is to evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of trilaciclib when administered prior to sacituzumab govitecan-hziy as measured by progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints include evaluation of the anti-tumor efficacy as measured by the objective response rate (ORR), duration of objective response (DOR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), overall survival (OS); and evaluation of the myeloprotective effects of trilaciclib. 
In November 2022, we provided encouraging initial data this Phase 2 trial. Initial data demonstrate the potential for an on-target effect of trilaciclib to meaningfully reduce the rates of adverse events associated with sacituzumab govitecan-hziy, including myelosuppression, diarrhea, and potentially alopecia (due to the presence of CDK4/6-expressing cells in the intestinal crypt and hair follicles) compared to the previously published sacituzumab govitecan-hziy single agent safety profile. We expect to release a more comprehensive data set including safety and initial efficacy results, including outcome by tumor PD-L1 status, in the second quarter of 2023.
Phase 2 clinical trial to confirm the anti-tumor mechanism of action (MOA) in the tumor microenvironment
We initiated this trial in the fourth quarter of 2021. The trial is a Phase 2 multicenter, single arm, open-label study of trilaciclib in patients with early-stage neoadjuvant TNBC designed to further investigate the role of trilaciclib in modulating the anti-tumor immune response. Pathologic complete response endpoints are also being evaluated in this trial and are expected to be available in the second quarter of 2023. The primary objective is to evaluate the immune-based mechanism of action (“MOA”) of trilaciclib after a single-dose as measured by the change in the ratio of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) to regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the tumor microenvironment. Secondary and exploratory endpoints include the assessment of pathologic complete response (pCR) at the time of definitive surgery, and safety of the combination of trilaciclib with neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen; exploratory endpoints include assessment of the immune response, and identification of molecular and cellular biomarkers in tumor or blood samples that may be indicative of clinical response/resistance, pharmacodynamic activity, and/or the mechanism of action of trilaciclib. 
In December 2022, we reported data at the annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS) from the first 24 patients, which show favorable alterations in the tumor microenvironment from a single dose of trilaciclib monotherapy (240 mg/m2) as measured by increases in the proportions of CD8+ T cells compared to T regulatory cells (Tregs) in patients with early-stage TNBC. The improvement of the ratio of CD8+ T cells to Tregs may enhance the overall anti-tumor immune response and support the trends we observed in preclinical studies and in our Phase 2 trial in TNBC. No trilaciclib related serious adverse events have been reported. We anticipate the pathologic complete response (pCR) results, including outcome by tumor PD-L1 status, to be available in the second quarter of 2023. 

Phase 2 clinical trial in first line Bladder Cancer (PRESERVE 3)
We initiated PRESERVE 3, a Phase 2, randomized, open-label study of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy and maintenance therapy with the immune checkpoint inhibitor, avelumab, administered alone, or in combination with trilaciclib, in patients with untreated, locally advanced or mUC, in the second quarter of 2021. The primary endpoint is to evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of trilaciclib when combined with platinum-based chemotherapy and the checkpoint inhibitor avelumab maintenance therapy as measured by progression-free survival (PFS) during the overall study. Key secondary endpoints include evaluation of the anti-tumor efficacy of trilaciclib as measured by the ORR, DOR, PFS in the maintenance period, OS and other metrics. We have entered into a clinical trial collaboration with the alliance between Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany and Pfizer whereby the alliance will contribute clinical supply of avelumab to this G1-sponsored and funded trial in mUC. 
In January 2023, we provided an initial update on PRESERVE 3. The confirmed ORR per RECIST v1.1 was comparable between arms with ORR being 40.0% (n=18/45) and 46.7% (n=21/45) among evaluable patients in the trilaciclib and control arms, respectively. We believe that longer-term follow-up is required to characterize additional anti-tumor endpoints including median duration of response and PFS. Though early, the safety and tolerability profile of trilaciclib administered prior to chemotherapy is generally consistent with that expected in patients treated with gemcitabine plus cisplatin/carboplatin and avelumab maintenance for previously untreated advanced or mUC. The data monitoring committee reviews the safety of trilaciclib on an ongoing basis and recommended that the study continue as planned. Additional safety and efficacy data, including the primary endpoint of PFS, are anticipated mid-2023. 
Investigator Sponsored Studies (ISS) Program
Trilaciclib (IV CDK4/6 inhibitor)
An Investigator Sponsored Study (“ISS”) is a study that is developed and conducted by a qualified physician external to G1 Therapeutics who assumes full responsibility for the conduct of the study. An ISS can take a variety of forms including clinical and nonclinical studies that may be interventional or observational. We support studies that align with our areas of scientific interest.
In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company announced that we were supporting a new Phase 2 ISS of trilaciclib and lurbinectedin in patients with ES-SCLC, This is a prospective, non-randomized, single-arm Phase 2 study, to evaluate trilaciclib administered intravenously prior to lurbinectedin in approximately 30 subjects with platinum refractory ES-SCLC. The primary endpoint is the rate of grade 4 neutropenia in any cycle. Secondary endpoints include mean duration (days) of grade 4 neutropenia in cycle 1, overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), overall rate of response (ORR), quality of life assessments, and the use of secondary/reactive supportive measures including G-CSF administration.
Trilaciclib: regulatory status
COSELA for injection was approved by the FDA in February 2021 to decrease the incidence of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression in adult patients when administered prior to a platinum/etoposide-containing regimen or topotecan-containing regimen for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). The approval was based on three small cell lung cancer (“SCLC”) trials demonstrating that trilaciclib, when added to standard of care chemotherapy or chemotherapy/checkpoint inhibitor regimens, mitigates clinically significant chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression. Discussions with European regulatory authorities have indicated existing data is sufficient to support an MAA to the EMA for trilaciclib for myeloprotection in ES-SCLC.
We received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA in 2019 based on positive myeloprotection data in small cell lung cancer patients from three randomized Phase 2 clinical trials. As is common with Breakthrough-designated products that receive priority review, we will conduct certain post-marketing activities, including in vitro drug-drug interaction and metabolism studies, and a clinical trial to assess the impact of trilaciclib on disease progression or survival in patients with ES-SCLC with chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression treated with a platinum/etoposide-containing or topotecan-containing regimen with at least a two year follow up. We are in the process of site selection for the post-approval clinical trial and anticipate site activation and first patient enrollment in the first half of 2023.

In 2021, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to trilaciclib for use in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of locally advanced or mTNBC. Fast track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill unmet medical needs. The purpose is to get important new drugs to the patient earlier. A drug that receives Fast Track designation may be eligible for more frequent engagements with the FDA to discuss a drug’s clinical development plan, eligibility for Accelerated Approval and Priority Review, and Rolling Review in which completed sections of a New Drug Application (NDA) can be submitted for FDA review on a rolling basis rather than waiting until all sections of the NDA are completed before the entire application can be reviewed.
We continue to engage in research and clinical development of trilaciclib in order seek regulatory approval to market additional indications in multiple tumor types and treatment combinations, including breast cancer and bladder cancer.
Lerociclib
Lerociclib is a differentiated clinical-stage oral CDK4/6 inhibitor being developed for use in combination with other targeted therapies in multiple oncology indications. In 2020, we entered into separate, exclusive agreements with EQRx, Inc. (rights for U.S., Europe, Japan and all markets outside Asia-Pacific) and Genor Biopharma Co. Inc. (rights for Asia-Pacific, excluding Japan) for the development and commercialization of lerociclib in all indications. Combined, these agreements provide $26.0 million in upfront payments, along with sales-based royalties, and the opportunity for up to $330.0 million in potential milestone payments. EQRx, Inc. and Genor Biopharma Co. Inc. are responsible for all costs related to the development and commercialization of lerociclib in their respective territories.
Rintodestrant
Rintodestrant is an oral SERD for use as a monotherapy and in combination with CDK4/6 inhibitors, initially Ibrance® (palbociclib), for the treatment of ER+, HER2- breast cancer. After completing the evaluation of our rintodestrant partnering options and recent data in the highly competitive oral SERD space, we made the strategic decision to discontinue the program. We reverted the rights back to the originator (University of Illinois Chicago) during the third quarter of 2022; there are no additional financial obligations due to the originator resulting from the reversion. 
CDK2 Inhibitor
In 2020, we entered into a global license agreement with Incyclix Bio, LLC (“Incyclix”), formerly ARC Therapeutics, LLC, for the development and commercialization of an internally discovered cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (“CDK2”) inhibitor for all human and veterinary uses. Incyclix is currently granted an exclusive, royalty-bearing, license with the right to grant sublicenses to one of our solely owned patent families.
Our Business Strategy
Our goal is to improve the lives of those impacted by cancer through the ongoing development and expansion of trilaciclib. Our strategy includes the following key components:
•Establish COSELA as the standard of care for ES-SCLC in the United States. COSELA (trilaciclib) for Injection was approved by the FDA in February 2021 to decrease the incidence of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression in adult patients when administered prior to a platinum/etoposide-containing regimen or topotecan-containing regimen for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC).
•Maximize long-term value of trilaciclib by executing our robust development plan across multiple indications and treatment settings. We believe that, because of its mechanism of action and unique attributes, including rapid onset from IV administration, potent and selective CDK4 and CDK6 inhibition, and short half life trilaciclib has the potential to be used to treat patients receiving myelosuppressive cytotoxic therapies like chemotherapy and to meaningfully improve anti-tumor efficacy across multiple tumor types and when administered in various treatment combinations. 
•Manage capital efficiently to fully fund operations. We intend to efficiently execute our capital management strategies to ensure our ability to fund our operations, including the commercialization of COSELA in ES-SCLC, and our ongoing and future clinical programs to develop trilaciclib in additional cancer indications. 
Commercialization
In February 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") approved COSELA (trilaciclib) to decrease the incidence of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression in adult patients when administered prior to a platinum/etoposide-containing regimen or topotecan-containing regimen for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). In June 2020, we entered into a three-year co-promotion agreement for COSELA in the United States and Puerto Rico with Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“BI”). In December 2021, G1 and BI mutually agreed to end the co-promotion agreement for COSELA, effective March 2022. At that time, we announced that we would hire and deploy a team of G1 oncology sales representatives to accelerate sales activities and help maximize the adoption of COSELA. As of February 21, 2022, all sales representatives have been hired, trained and deployed. We are now managing and executing all commercial activities in-house, including sales, marketing, market access and clinical nurse educator functions, as well as product distribution. The G1 to One program serves as a patient hub and provides patient and healthcare provider services.
We plan to globally commercialize our product candidates through the establishment of collaboration agreements with global and/or regional pharmaceutical companies to leverage our and their development and commercialization infrastructures and capabilities, enabling us to cost-effectively maximize the global commercial opportunities of our product candidates.
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties (contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs) for the manufacture of our product candidates. To date, we have obtained drug substances and drug products for our preclinical studies, clinical trials and commercial product from multiple third-party manufacturers. Redundant suppliers are in place for some of our drug substances and drug products. As development proceeds for our products, we will evaluate qualifying additional redundant manufacturers for drug substances and drug products.
Although we are reliant on third parties to manufacture our products, we have personnel with extensive manufacturing experience to oversee the relationships with our CMOs. CMOs are subject to extensive governmental regulations and we depend on them to manufacture our products in accordance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP. We have an established quality assurance program to ensure that the CMOs involved in the manufacture of products do so in accordance with cGMP and other applicable U.S. and foreign regulations. We believe that our current CMO network complies with such regulations.
Competition
The development and commercialization of new drug therapies is highly competitive. We will face competition with respect to all therapeutics we may develop or commercialize in the future from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies worldwide. Any drug candidates we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with currently marketed drugs and therapies used for treatment of the same indications, and potentially with products currently in development for the same indications. Many of the entities marketing or developing potentially competing products have significantly greater financial resources and expertise than we do in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing. We believe the key competitive factors affecting the success of any approved product will be its efficacy, safety profile, price, convenience of administration, and level of promotional activity. Accordingly, our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, have fewer side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop.
COSELA is the first approved therapy designed and optimized to help protect HSPCs and immune system function from damage by chemotherapy. We believe administering trilaciclib with the current standard of care may minimize chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression, including the following adverse side effects: fatigue due to anemia; infections due to neutropenia; and bleeding due to thrombocytopenia. Currently, these adverse side effects often require costly rescue interventions such as hospitalizations, transfusions, antibiotic usage and/or treatment with growth factor support. Trilaciclib may reduce the need to administer the existing rescue growth factor support treatments, including Neulasta® (pegfigrastim), Neupogen® (filgrastim), Procrit® (epoeitin alpha), and Aranesp® (darbepoetin alfa) as well as biosimilars of these products. In addition, trilaciclib may compete with multiple approved drugs or drugs that may be approved in the future, such as plinabulin which is in development for chemotherapy induced-neutropenia and ALRN-6924 which is in development for chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression. 

Intellectual property
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection in jurisdictions where we seek to commercialize our FDA approved CDK4/6 inhibitor trilaciclib (COSELA). Our commercial success also depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection in the jurisdictions where our licensees seek to commercialize our proprietary CDK inhibitors, including clinical candidates trilaciclib and lerociclib. We have secured patent protection to the composition of matter for trilaciclib and lerociclib in a number of jurisdictions, including for example, the United States, Europe, China, Hong Kong, Macau, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Australia, Canada, Mexico, India, Israel, Russia, and Brazil. We have secured patent protection to the use of trilaciclib or lerociclib for the treatment of certain cancers, including in the United States, Europe, China, Hong Kong, Macau, Japan, and Canada. We also, where we believe appropriate, seek protection on processes for the production of our CDK4/6 inhibitors, formulations, additional compositions, combinations of our product candidates with other active agents and dosing schedules and regimens. Our success also depends on our ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications covering our proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. In addition, we plan to seek patent term adjustments, restorations, and/or patent term extensions where applicable in the United States and other jurisdictions. For example, we have filed for patent term extensions with the United States Patent and Trademark Office seeking the extension of term for patents encompassing trilaciclib. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. Additionally, we expect to benefit, where appropriate, from statutory frameworks in the United States, Europe, and other countries that provide a period of clinical data exclusivity to compensate for the time required for regulatory approval of our drug products. See also the “Government Regulation and Product Approval” section below. 
We are the sole owner or exclusive licensee of all of our patents and currently filed patent applications that cover trilaciclib and lerociclib. We have the exclusive right to prosecute these patent families in our sole discretion, and, where we have out-licensed patents and patent applications, our licensees have the right to review and comment on all material patent filings, and their review and comments will be considered by us in good faith. Our intellectual property strategy includes patenting our CDK4/6 inhibitors, their uses, and methods of manufacturing. We have obtained more than twenty composition-of-matter patents in the United States on a number of our CDK4/6 inhibitors, including claims that cover trilaciclib and lerociclib, and we continue to seek composition-of-matter patents on additional CDK inhibitors both in the United States and throughout the world. In addition, we have obtained more than eighteen patents in the United States on methods of treatment using a number of our CDK4/6 inhibitors, including claims that cover methods of using trilaciclib and lerociclib. We continue to seek additional patents for our key CDK4/6 inhibitors and their uses in key therapeutic areas. 
As of December 31, 2022, we have listed 10 U.S. granted patents in the U.S. FDA’s Orange Book for our U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved drug trilaciclib (COSELA), with an additional patent granted pending listing. In addition, on April 8, 2021, we filed a request for patent term extension pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 156 on two of these listed patents (U.S. 8,598,186 and U.S. 9,487,530). We ultimately intend to elect one patent for extension. To the extent U.S. 8,598,186 is elected, the term is expected to be extended to December 30, 2034. To the extent U.S. 9,487,530 is elected, the term is expected to be extended to February 12, 2035.
We continually assess and refine our intellectual property strategies as we develop new technologies and product candidates. We plan to file additional patent applications based on our intellectual property strategies where appropriate, including where we seek to adapt to competition or to improve business opportunities. Further, we plan to file patent applications, as we consider appropriate under the circumstances, to protect new technologies that we develop. Our patent filing strategy typically includes seeking patent protection in the United States, the European Union, and in additional countries where we believe such protection is likely to be useful, including one or more of Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Macau, Russia, Singapore, and South Korea.

We are party to four license agreements relating to our CDK inhibitor technology. On May 22, 2020, we entered into a license agreement with Incyclix Bio, LLC ("Incyclix"), formerly ARC Therapeutics, LLC, where we out-licensed to Incyclix a portfolio of CDK2 inhibitors for development and commercialization. On June 15, 2020, we entered into a license agreement with Genor Biopharma Co. Inc.(“Genor”) for the development and commercialization of our CDK4/6 inhibitor lerociclib in the Genor Territory (as defined below). On July 22, 2020, we entered into a license agreement with EQRx, Inc. (“EQRx”) for the development and commercialization of lerociclib in the EQRx Territory (as defined below). On August 3, 2020, we entered into a license agreement with Nanjing Simcere Dongyuan Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, (“Simcere”) for the development and commercialization of our CDK4/6 inhibitor trilaciclib in the Simcere Territory (as defined below). Each of these license agreements is described below.
Our owned and in-licensed patent estate as of December 31, 2022, on a worldwide basis, includes over 390 granted or pending patent applications in more than 30 patent families with more than 46 granted U.S. patents. The term of individual patents depends upon the laws of the countries in which they are obtained. In the countries in which we currently file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing of a non-provisional patent application which serves as a priority application. However, the term of a U.S. patent may be extended to compensate for the time required to obtain regulatory approval to sell a drug (a patent term extension) or by delays encountered during patent prosecution that are caused by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) (referred to as patent term adjustment). For example, the Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension for FDA-approved drugs of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review and diligence during the review process. Patent term extensions cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, and only one patent covering an approved drug or its method of use may be extended. A similar kind of patent extension, referred to as a Supplementary Protection Certificate, is available in Europe. Legal frameworks are also available in certain other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent. We currently intend to seek patent term extensions on any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where we have a qualifying patent and the extension is available; however, there is no guarantee that the applicable regulatory authorities, including the FDA and the USPTO in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions. Further, even if our patent is extended, the patent, including the extended portion of the patent, may be held invalid or unenforceable by a court of final jurisdiction in the United States or a foreign country.
Our current issued patents covering the composition-of-matter for trilaciclib and lerociclib will expire in 2031, exclusive of any patent term extension. As described above, we have filed a request for patent term extension under 35 U.S.C. § 156 for a term extension of U.S. 8,598,186, which claims the composition of matter of trilaciclib, which, if granted, would extend the term of this patent to December 30, 2034. Our current issued patents covering methods of use of trilaciclib and lerociclib will expire in 2034 to 2039. As described above, we have filed a request for patent term extension under 35 U.S.C. § 156 for a term extension of U.S. 9,487,530, which claims the use of trilaciclib to reduce the effect of chemotherapy on healthy cells in a subject being treated for, among other things, small cell lung cancer, which, if granted, would extend the term of this patent to February 12, 2035. Our pending applications on additional methods of use of trilaciclib and lerociclib, should they issue, will expire on dates ranging from 2034 to 2043. We plan to file additional applications on aspects of our innovations that may have patent terms that extend beyond these dates. 
Any of our patents, including patents that we may rely on to protect our market for approved drugs, may be held invalid or unenforceable by a court of final jurisdiction. Alternatively, we may decide that it is in our interest to settle a litigation in a manner that affects the term or enforceability of our patent. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth or enforceability of claims that have been or may be granted in our patents or in third-party patents. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Our ability to obtain and maintain our proprietary position for our CDK4/6 inhibitors will depend on our success in enforcing the claims that have been granted or may grant. We do not know whether any of the pending patent applications that we have filed or may file or license from third parties will result in the issuance of any additional patents. The issued patents that we own or may receive in the future may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with sufficient protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may be able to independently develop and commercialize drugs with similar mechanisms of action and duplicate our methods of treatments or strategies without infringing our patents. Because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a drug we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our drugs can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent.

Exclusive license for rintodestrant
In November 2016, we entered into a license agreement with the University of Illinois, the University, pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license to make, use, import, sell and offer for sale certain SERDs, including rintodestrant, covered by patent rights owned by the University. The rights licensed to us are for all fields of use. The November 2016 license agreement was amended in March 2017. In May 2022, we notified the University that we were terminating the license agreement. After completing the evaluation of our rintodestrant partnering options and recent data in the highly competitive oral SERD space, we made the strategic decision to discontinue the program. We reverted the rights back to the originator, the University, during the third quarter of 2022; there are no additional financial obligations due to the originator resulting from the reversion.
Trade secrets
In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. 
Government regulation and product approval
FDA approval process
In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending new drug applications, or NDAs, warning letters, voluntary product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics and potential safety and effectiveness of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with certain federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices, or GLP, for any safety testing. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term nonclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators and in compliance with federal regulations, including those encompassing good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements that are meant to protect the rights and welfare of study subjects and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, investigators, and monitors, and (ii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. 
The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time by imposing a clinical hold or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial subjects. The clinical trial protocol and informed consent information for subjects in clinical trials must also be submitted for review and approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, on behalf of each participating in the clinical trial before the trial commences at that site. An IRB also monitors the trial until completion and may require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements or for safety issues or it may impose other conditions on the clinical investigators or the sponsor of the clinical trial.
After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all nonclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, currently over $2.8 million for an NDA with clinical information, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program fee, currently over $330,000. These fees are typically increased annually. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances.
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. The FDA seeks to review applications for standard review drug products within ten months, and applications for priority review drugs within six months. Priority review can be applied to drugs intended to treat a serious condition and that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The review process for both standard and priority reviews may be extended by FDA for three additional months to consider additional, late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission in response to FDA review questions.
The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an external advisory committee, which is typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured, unless the facility has recently had an FDA inspection. The FDA also typically inspects the application sponsor. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or additional nonclinical or clinical study information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. 

An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with the accompanying approved prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, in addition to the approved labeling, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. A REMS could include communication plans for health care professionals, medication guides for patients, and/or elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, restricted distribution requirements, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The FDA determines the requirement for a REMS, as well as the specific REMS provisions, on a case-by-case basis. If the FDA concludes a REMS plan is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS plan. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy as described as postmarketing commitments or requirements included in the approval letter. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements and commitments is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
Disclosure of clinical trial information
Sponsors of clinical trials of certain FDA-regulated products, including prescription drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on a public registry maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH). Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, clinical trial sites and investigator, and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration of the clinical trial. Although sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion, disclosure of the results may be delayed in some cases for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the design and progress of our development programs. Failure to timely register a covered clinical study or to submit study results as provided for in the law can give rise to civil monetary penalties and also prevent the non-compliant party from receiving future grant funds from the federal government. The NIH’s Final Rule on ClinicalTrials.gov registration and reporting requirements became effective in 2017, and both NIH and FDA have signaled the government’s willingness to begin enforcing those requirements against non-compliant clinical trial sponsors.
Data privacy and the protection of personal information
We are subject to laws and regulations governing data privacy and the protection of personal information including health information. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues which will continue to affect our business. In the United States, we may be subject to state security breach notification laws, state laws protecting the privacy of health and personal information and federal and state consumer protections laws which regulate the collection, use, disclosure and transmission of personal information. These laws overlap and often conflict and each of these laws is subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues for us. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to penalties or sanctions, including criminal penalties. Our customers and research partners must comply with laws governing the privacy and security of health information, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 as amended (“HIPAA”) and state health information privacy laws. If we knowingly obtain health information that is protected under HIPAA, called “protected health information”, our customers or research collaborators may be subject to enforcement and we may have direct liability for the unlawful receipt of protected health information or for aiding and abetting a HIPAA violation. 

State laws protecting health and personal information are becoming increasingly stringent. For example, California has implemented the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act that imposes restrictive requirements regulating the use and disclosure of health information and other personally identifiable information, and California has recently adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the CCPA). The CCPA mirrors a number of the key provisions of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) described below. The CCPA establishes a new privacy framework for covered businesses by creating an expanded definition of personal information, establishing new data privacy rights for consumers in the State of California, imposing special rules on the collection of consumer data from minors, and creating a new and potentially severe statutory damages framework for violations of the CCPA and for businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Additionally, a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), was approved by California voters in the election on November 3, 2020, and certain provisions are effective as of January 1, 2022, with full effectiveness as of January 1, 2023. The CPRA modifies the CCPA significantly, potentially resulting in further uncertainty, additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply and additional potential for harm and liability for failure to comply. Among other things the CPRA established a new regulatory authority, the California Privacy Protection Agency, with will be enacting new regulations and will have expanded enforcement authority. Virginia and Colorado enacted similar data protection laws in 2021, and other U.S. states have proposals under consideration, increasing the regulatory compliance risk. 
The Hatch-Waxman Act and marketing applications for follow-on drugs
In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDC Act, Congress authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the statute and also enacted Section 505(b)(2) of the FDC Act. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference listed drug, or RLD. Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug. 
Orange book listing
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent that has claims that cover the applicant’s product or method of therapeutic use. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an ANDA. The ANDA requests permission to market a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the RLD and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the RLD. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, nonclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the innovator drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug referenced by the ANDA applicant if the FDA’s listing for the generic drug in the Orange Book indicates that it is “therapeutically equivalent” to the RLD.
In contrast, Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. A Section 505(b)(2) applicant may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies, if it can establish that reliance on studies conducted for a previously approved product is scientifically appropriate. Unlike the ANDA pathway used by developers of bioequivalent versions of innovator drugs, which does not allow applicants to submit new clinical data other than bioavailability or bioequivalence data, the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway does not preclude the possibility that a follow-on applicant would need to conduct additional clinical trials or nonclinical studies; for example, it may be seeking approval to market a previously approved drug for new indications or for a new patient population that would require new clinical data to demonstrate safety or effectiveness.

When an ANDA applicant submits its application to the FDA, it is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement, certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain or carve out any language regarding the patented method-of-use, rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. Moreover, to the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant also is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. 
If the applicant does not challenge the innovator’s listed patents, FDA will not approve the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
An ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired.
Non-Patent Exclusivity
Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity or NCE, which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by the FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which time the FDA cannot receive any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug. Certain changes to a drug, such as the addition of a new indication to the package insert or a different formulation, are associated with a three-year period of exclusivity. During the exclusivity period, the FDA cannot accept for review any ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed on an NCE patent and any time after approval if the application is filed based on a new indication or a new formulation.
The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides three years of data exclusivity for a NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving follow-on applications for drugs containing the original active agent. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification, and, thus, no ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period. Five-year and three-year exclusivity also will not delay the submission or approval of a traditional NDA filed under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDC Act. However, an applicant submitting a traditional NDA would be required to either conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Patent term extension
After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five-year patent term extension. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase—the time between when the IND becomes effective and NDA submission—and all of the review phase—the time between NDA submission and approval, up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years.

For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted.
Pediatric clinical trials and exclusivity
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs or certain types of supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The sponsor must submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within 60 days of an end-of-phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and the FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from nonclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of pediatric assessment data.
The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, provides NDA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity—patent or non-patent—for a drug if certain conditions are met, including satisfaction of a pediatric trial(s) agreed with FDA as a Pediatric Written Request. Conditions for pediatric exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the FDA making a written request for pediatric clinical trials, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested clinical trials within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to the written request from the FDA for such data. Those data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. Although this is not a patent term extension, it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application.
Fast track, breakthrough therapy, and priority review designations
The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited development or review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs include fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, and priority review designation. Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Generally, drugs that may be eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs, and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, fast track designation is a process designed to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs to treat serious or life-threatening diseases and fill an unmet medical need. The designation request may be made at the time of IND submission and generally no later than the pre-NDA meeting. The FDA will respond within 60 calendar days of receipt of the request. Priority review, which is requested at the time of NDA submission, is designed to give drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists, an initial review within six months after filing as compared to a standard review time of ten months. Although fast track designation and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a fast track designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review. Accelerated approval provides an earlier approval of drugs to treat serious diseases, and that fill an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint, which is a laboratory measurement or physical sign used as an indirect or substitute measurement representing a clinically meaningful outcome. Discussions with the FDA about the feasibility of an accelerated approval typically begin early in the development of the drug in order to identify, among other things, an appropriate endpoint. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials to confirm the appropriateness of the surrogate marker clinical trial.

Another expedited program is that for breakthrough therapy designation, which is designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint(s). A sponsor may request breakthrough therapy designation at the time that the IND is submitted, or no later than at the end-of-Phase 2 meeting. The FDA will respond to a breakthrough therapy designation request within sixty days of receipt of the request. A drug that receives breakthrough therapy designation is eligible for all fast track designation features, intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program, beginning as early as Phase 1, and commitment from the FDA involving senior managers. Products that are designated as Breakthrough therapies with priority review are often given preclinical or clinical post-marketing requirements or post marketing commitments by the FDA.
Accelerated approval pathway 
In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval from the FDA and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. A surrogate endpoint is a laboratory measurement or physical sign used as an indirect or substitute measurement representing a clinically meaningful outcome. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a drug when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval when the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate long-term clinical benefit of a drug. 
Discussions with the FDA about the feasibility of an accelerated approval typically begin early in the development of the drug in order to identify, among other things, an appropriate endpoint. The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a drug, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. For example, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of drugs for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large clinical trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit.
As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials to verify and describe the predicted effect on IMM or other clinical endpoint. Drugs granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval. Because the accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the drug’s clinical benefit, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or to confirm the predicted clinical benefit of the product during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw approval of the drug. In addition, all promotional materials for product candidates being considered and approved under the accelerated approval program are subject to prior review by the FDA.
Regulation of companion diagnostic devices
If we decide that a diagnostic test would provide useful information for patient selection or if the FDA requires us to develop such a test, we may work with a collaborator to develop an in vitro diagnostic, or companion test. The FDA regulates in vitro diagnostic tests as medical devices, and the type of regulation to which such a test will be subjected will depend, in part, on a risk assessment by the FDA as well as a determination of whether the test is intended to yield results that would be helpful to know versus one that the FDA or we believe is necessary to know for the safe and effective use of our drugs under development.

The FDA has issued several guidance documents on in vitro companion diagnostic devices in August 2014, which are intended to assist companies developing in vitro companion diagnostic devices and companies developing therapeutic products that depend on the use of a specific in vitro companion diagnostic for the safe and effective use of the product. The FDA defines an in vitro companion diagnostic device, or IVD companion diagnostic device, as a device that provides information that is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding therapeutic product, such as when the use of a product is limited to a specific patient subpopulation that can be identified by using the test. The use of an IVD companion diagnostic device with a therapeutic product will be stipulated in the instructions for use in the labeling of both the diagnostic device and the corresponding therapeutic product, including the labeling of any generic equivalents of the therapeutic product. The FDA expects that the therapeutic product sponsor will address the need for an approved or cleared IVD companion diagnostic device in its therapeutic product development plan and that, in most cases, the therapeutic product and its corresponding companion diagnostic will be developed contemporaneously. However, the FDA may decide that it is appropriate to approve such a product without an approved or cleared in vitro companion diagnostic device when the drug or therapeutic biologic is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition for which no satisfactory alternative treatment exists and the FDA determines that the benefits from the use of a product with an unapproved or uncleared in vitro companion diagnostic device are so pronounced as to outweigh the risks from the lack of an approved or cleared in vitro companion diagnostic device. The FDA encourages sponsors considering developing a therapeutic product that requires a companion diagnostic to request a meeting with both relevant device and therapeutic product review divisions to ensure that the product development plan will produce sufficient data to establish the safety and effectiveness of both the therapeutic product and the companion diagnostic. Because the FDA’s policies on companion diagnostics is set forth only in guidance, this policy is subject to change and is not legally binding.
Post-approval requirements 
Following FDA marketing approval of a new prescription drug product, the manufacturer and the approved drug are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, product sampling and distribution restrictions, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations (i.e., “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. If there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or an NDA supplement, which may require the applicant to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the drug product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, may result in in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
■restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
■fines, warning letters or other enforcement-related letters or clinical holds on post-approval clinical trials;
■refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
■product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
■injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and
■consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment, or exclusion from federal health care programs; or mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information.

Accordingly, COSELA and any future therapeutic candidate manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things: 
■record-keeping requirements; 
■reporting of adverse experiences with the therapeutic candidate; 
■providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information; 
■therapeutic sampling and distribution requirements; 
■notifying the FDA and gaining its approval of specified manufacturing or labeling changes; and
■complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among other things, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in-patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling, limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet.
FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMPs. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports and returned or salvaged products. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drug products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and some state agencies for compliance with cGMPs and other laws. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP requirements. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the NDA applicant and any third-party manufacturers involved in producing the approved drug product. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of quality control and quality assurance. 
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or the PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. Most recently, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or the DSCSA, was enacted with the aim of building an electronic system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs distributed in the United States, including most biological products. The DSCSA mandates phased-in and resource-intensive obligations for pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers over a 10‑year period that is expected to culminate in November 2023. From time to time, new legislation and regulations may be implemented that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or regulatory changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
Europe/Rest of world government regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are and will be subject, either directly or through our distribution partners, to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials, the privacy of personal data and commercial sales and distribution of our products, if approved.
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in non-U.S. countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like an IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a clinical trial application, or CTA, must be submitted to the competent national health authority and to independent ethics committees in each country in which a company plans to conduct clinical trials. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trials may proceed in that country.

The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country, even though there is already some degree of legal harmonization in the European Union member states resulting from the national implementation of underlying E.U. legislation. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and other applicable regulatory requirements.
To obtain a marketing license for a new drug, or medicinal product in the European Union, the sponsor must obtain approval of a marketing authorization application, or MAA. The way in which a medicinal product can be approved in the European Union depends on the nature of the medicinal product.
The centralized procedure results in a single marketing authorization granted by the European Commission that is valid across the European Union, as well as in Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human drugs that are: (i) derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, (ii) contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases, (iii) officially designated “orphan drugs” (drugs used for rare human diseases) and (iv) advanced-therapy medicines, such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines. The centralized procedure may at the request of the applicant also be used for human drugs which do not fall within the above mentioned categories if the human drug (a) contains a new active substance which was not authorized in the European Community; or (b) the applicant shows that the medicinal product constitutes a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or that the granting of authorization in the centralized procedure is in the interests of patients or animal health at the European Community level.
Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP), with adoption of the actual marketing authorization by the European Commission thereafter. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest from the point of view of therapeutic innovation, defined by three cumulative criteria: the seriousness of the disease to be treated; the absence of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach, and anticipation of exceptional high therapeutic benefit. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the evaluation for the opinion of the CHMP is completed within 150 days and the opinion issued thereafter.
The mutual recognition procedure, or MRP, for the approval of human drugs is an alternative approach to facilitate individual national marketing authorizations within the European Union. Basically, the MRP may be applied for all human drugs for which the centralized procedure is not obligatory. The MRP is applicable to the majority of conventional medicinal products, and is based on the principle of recognition of an already existing national marketing authorization by one or more member states. In the MRP, a marketing authorization for a drug already exists in one or more member states of the E.U. and subsequently marketing authorization applications are made in other European Union member states by referring to the initial marketing authorization. The member state in which the marketing authorization was first granted will then act as the reference member state. The member states where the marketing authorization is subsequently applied for act as concerned member states. After a product assessment is completed by the reference member state, copies of the report are sent to all member states, together with the approved summary of product characteristics, labeling and package leaflet. The concerned member states then have 90 days to recognize the decision of the reference member state and the summary of product characteristics, labeling and package leaflet. National marketing authorizations within individual member states shall be granted within 30 days after acknowledgement of the agreement
Should any member state refuse to recognize the marketing authorization by the reference member state, on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the issue will be referred to a coordination group. Within a timeframe of 60 days, member states shall, within the coordination group, make all efforts to reach a consensus. If this fails, the procedure is submitted to an EMA scientific committee for arbitration. The opinion of this EMA committee is then forwarded to the Commission, for the start of the decision-making process. As in the centralized procedure, this process entails consulting various European Commission Directorates General and the Standing Committee on Human Medicinal Products or Veterinary Medicinal Products, as appropriate.
For countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the other applicable regulatory requirements.

If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension of clinical trials, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions, and criminal prosecution.
Europe - Data Privacy 
On May 25, 2018, the European General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, went into effect, implementing a broad data protection framework that expanded the scope of EU data protection law, including to non-EU entities that process, or control the processing of, personal data relating to individuals located in the EU, including clinical trial data. The GDPR sets out a number of requirements that must be complied with when handling the personal data of European Union-based data subjects including: providing expanded disclosures about how their personal data will be used; higher standards for organizations to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent or have another legal basis in place to justify their data processing activities; the obligation to appoint data protection officers in certain circumstances; new rights for individuals to be “forgotten” and rights to data portability, as well as enhanced current rights (e.g. access requests); the principal of accountability and demonstrating compliance through policies, procedures, training and audit; and a new mandatory data breach regime. In particular, medical or health data, genetic data and biometric data where the latter is used to uniquely identify an individual are all classified as “special category” data under the GDPR and afforded greater protection and require additional compliance obligations. Further, EU member states have a broad right to impose additional conditions—including restrictions—on these data categories. This is because the GDPR allows EU member states to derogate from the requirements of the GDPR mainly in regard to specific processing situations (including special category data and processing for scientific or statistical purposes). As the EU states continue to reframe their national legislation to harmonize with the GDPR, we will need to monitor compliance with all relevant EU member states’ laws and regulations, including where permitted derogations from the GDPR are introduced.
We will also be subject to evolving EU laws on data export, if we transfer data outside the EU to ourselves or third parties outside of the EU. The GDPR only permits exports of data outside the EU where there is a suitable data transfer solution in place to safeguard personal data (e.g. the European Union Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses). On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union or the CJEU, issued a landmark opinion in the case Maximilian Schrems vs. Facebook (Case C-311/18), called Schrems II. This decision calls into question certain data transfer mechanisms as between the EU member states and the US. The CJEU is the highest court in Europe and the Schrems II decision heightens the burden on data importers to assess U.S. national security laws on their business and future actions of EU data protection authorities are difficult to predict. Consequently, there is some risk of any data transfers from the European Union being halted. If we have to rely on third parties to carry out services for us, including processing personal data on our behalf, we are required under GDPR to enter into contractual arrangements to help ensure that these third parties only process such data according to our instructions and have sufficient security measures in place. Any security breach or non-compliance with our contractual terms or breach of applicable law by such third parties could result in enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity and could cause customers to lose trust in us, which would have an adverse impact on our reputation and business. Any contractual arrangements requiring the transfer of personal data from the EU to us in the United States will require greater scrutiny and assessments as required under Schrems II and may have an adverse impact on cross-border transfers of personal data, or increase costs of compliance. The GDPR provides an enforcement authority to impose large penalties for noncompliance, including the potential for fines of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. We will be subject to the GDPR when we have a European Union presence or “establishment” (e.g., EU based subsidiary or operations), when conducting clinical trials with EU based data subjects, whether the trials are conducted directly by us or through a vendor or partner, or offering approved products or services to EU-based data subjects, regardless of whether involving a EU based subsidiary or operations. 
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing, and Reimbursement
Sales of our products that are approved by the FDA will depend, in part, on the extent to which the products will be covered by third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers, and managed care organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved, and it is time consuming and expensive to seek reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. Coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the product is approved by the FDA or regulatory authorities in other countries.

In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any product will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim payments for new products, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Payment rates may vary according to the use of the product and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on payments allowed for lower cost products that are already reimbursed and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for products may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by third-party payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of products from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. In the U.S., third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies, but they also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare coverage and reimbursement determinations. Accordingly, one third-party payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product.
In addition, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of therapeutics have been a focus in this effort. The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. Moreover, companion diagnostic tests require coverage and reimbursement separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement for their companion pharmaceutical products. Similar challenges to obtaining coverage and reimbursement for the pharmaceutical products apply to companion diagnostics.
In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to currently available therapies (so called health technology assessment, or HTA) in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. E.U. member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, there can be considerable pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various E.U. member states, and parallel distribution (arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states), can further reduce prices. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our product candidates that are approved for commercial marketing and distribution. Historically, therapeutic candidates launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be significantly lower.
Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations
As we are commercializing COSELA and may commercialize other product candidates in the future, we are subject to additional healthcare statutory and regulatory requirements and enforcement by federal government and the states and foreign governments in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of COSELA and any other product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our arrangements with third-party payors and customers expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval. 

Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:
•The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute is subject to evolving interpretations. In the past, the government has enforced the federal Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act; 
•The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalty laws, prohibit, among other things, knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. government, knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the U.S. government, or from knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. government. Actions under these laws may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. The federal government uses these laws, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the U.S., for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other allegedly unlawful sales and marketing practices; 
•The U.S. federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created new federal, civil and criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;
•The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act of 2010, among other things, imposes reporting requirements on manufacturers of FDA-approved drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies covered by Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report, on an annual basis, to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, chiropractors and, beginning in 2022 for payments and other transfers of value provided in the previous year, certain advanced non-physician health care practitioners), teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; 

•HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations impose specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities, which include certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions; 
•Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, that may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers;
•State laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and may require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures to the extent that those laws impose requirements that are more stringent than the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, as well as state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and
•State laws and foreign laws and regulations (particularly European Union laws regarding personal data relating to individuals based in Europe) that govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
Moreover, in November 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (“DHHS”) finalized significant changes to the regulations implementing the Anti-Kickback Statute, as well as the Physician Self-Referral Law (Stark Law) and the civil monetary penalty rules regarding beneficiary inducements, with the goal of offering the healthcare industry more flexibility and reducing the regulatory burden associated with those fraud and abuse laws, particularly with respect to value-based arrangements among industry participants. As noted below under “Healthcare Reform,” however, those final rules may be potentially overturned under the Congressional Review Act following the change in control of the legislative and executive branches in January 2021.
Ensuring that our current and future business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities may conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including monetary damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, loss of eligibility to obtain approvals from the FDA, exclusion from participation in government contracting, healthcare reimbursement or other government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, or additional reporting requirements if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with any of these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs. 

Healthcare Reform and potential changes to drug and healthcare laws 
In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product and therapeutic candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect the ability to profitably sell product and therapeutic candidates that obtain marketing approval. The FDA’s and other regulatory authorities’ policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product and therapeutic candidates. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we otherwise may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. 
For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, was enacted in March 2010 and has had a significant impact on the health care industry in the U.S. The ACA expanded coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to biopharmaceutical products, the ACA, among other things, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, established annual fees on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and created a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program. Additionally, on December 20, 2019, President Trump signed the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2020 into law (P.L. 116-94) that includes a piece of bipartisan legislation called the Creating and Restoring Equal Access to Equivalent Samples Act of 2019 or the “CREATES Act.” The CREATES Act aims to address the concern articulated by both the FDA and others in the industry that some brand manufacturers have improperly restricted the distribution of their products, including by invoking the existence of a REMS for certain products, to deny generic product developers access to samples of brand products. Because generic product developers need samples to conduct certain comparative testing required by the FDA, some have attributed the inability to timely obtain samples as a cause of delay in the entry of generic products. To remedy this concern, the CREATES Act establishes a private cause of action that permits a generic product developer to sue the brand manufacturer to compel it to furnish the necessary samples on “commercially reasonable, market-based terms.” Whether and how generic product developments will use this new pathway, as well as the likely outcome of any legal challenges to provisions of the CREATES Act, remain highly uncertain and its potential effects on future competition for COSELA or any of our other future commercial products are unknown.
As another example, the 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act signed into law on December 27, 2020 incorporated extensive healthcare provisions and amendments to existing laws, including a requirement that all manufacturers of drugs and biological products covered under Medicare Part B report the product’s average sales price, or ASP, to DHHS beginning on January 1, 2022, subject to enforcement via civil money penalties. 
Since its enactment, there have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. Members of the US Congress have indicated that they may continue to seek to modify, repeal or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the ACA. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, was enacted in 2017 and, among other things, removed penalties, starting January 1, 2019, for not complying with the ACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance, commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” In December 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate was a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the TCJA, the remaining provisions of the ACA were invalid and the law in its entirety was unconstitutional. In December 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional but remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether other reforms enacted as part of the ACA but not specifically related to the individual mandate or health insurance could be severed from the rest of the ACA so as not to be declared invalid as well. On March 2, 2020, the United States Supreme Court granted the petitions for writs of certiorari to review this case and allocated one hour for oral arguments, which occurred on November 10, 2020. A decision from the Supreme Court is expected to be issued in spring 2021. It is unclear how this litigation and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the implementation of the ACA, the pharmaceutical industry more generally, and our business. Complying with any new legislation or reversing changes implemented under the ACA could be time-intensive and expensive, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business.

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA that affect health care expenditures. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which began in 2013 and will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, which was signed into law on March 27, 2020 and was designed to provide financial support and resources to individuals and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, and extended the sequester by one year, through 2030, in order to offset the added expense of the 2020 cancellation. The 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act was subsequently signed into law on December 27, 2020 and extends the CARES Act suspension period to March 31, 2021.
Moreover, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. DHHS, has solicited feedback on some of various measures intended to lower drug prices and reduce the out of pocket costs of drugs and implemented others under its existing authority. For example, in May 2019, DHHS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. This final rule codified a DHHS policy change that was effective January 1, 2019. As part of the Trump Administration’s so-called “Blueprint” to lower drug prices, DHHS and FDA also released on July 31, 2019 their Safe Importation Action Plan proposing two different pathways for the importation of foreign drug products. One pathway focuses on the importation of certain drugs from Canada, which required the agencies to go through notice-and-comment rulemaking, while the second pathway allows manufacturers to distribute their drugs manufactured abroad and was released as agency policy in an FDA guidance document first issued in December 2019. FDA’s notice of proposed rulemaking to implement a system whereby state governmental entities could lawfully import and distribute prescription drugs sourced from Canada was published at the end of December 2019 and in September 2020, the rulemaking was finalized by FDA. Those new regulations became effective on November 30, 2020, although the impact of such future programs is uncertain, in part because lawsuits have been filed challenging the government’s authority to promulgate them. The final regulations may also be vulnerable to being overturned by a joint resolution of disapproval from Congress under the procedures set forth in the Congressional Review Act, which could be applied to regulatory actions taken by the Trump Administration on or after August 21, 2020 (i.e., in the last 60 days of legislative session of the 116th Congress). Congress and the executive branch have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs, making this area subject to ongoing uncertainty. In addition, the probability of success of other policies enacted over the final months of the Trump Administration and their impact on the U.S. prescription drug marketplace is unknown. There are likely to be political and legal challenges associated with implementing these reforms as they are currently envisioned, and the January 20, 2021 transition to a new Democrat-led presidential administration created further uncertainty. Following his inauguration, President Biden took immediate steps to order a regulatory freeze on all pending substantive executive actions in order to permit incoming department and agency heads to review whether questions of fact, policy, and law may be implicated and to determine how to proceed. 
Individual states in the United States have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In December 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court held unanimously that federal law does not preempt the states’ ability to regulate pharmaceutical benefit managers (PBMs) and other members of the health care and pharmaceutical supply chain, an important decision that may lead to further and more aggressive efforts by states in this area.
We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, including COSELA and any future products for which we secure marketing approval.

Human Capital
As of December 31, 2022, we had 170 full-time employees, including 47 in research and development and 123 in selling, general and administrative functions. Of these full-time employees, 34 had an MD, PhD or PharmD. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees, and we have not experienced any work stoppages. We expect headcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future, particularly as we continue to develop our products and commercialize COSELA. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. 
Diversity and Inclusion
Diversity and inclusion are an important part of our culture. We seek to build a diverse and inclusive workplace where we can leverage our collective cognitive and other diversity. We conduct routine pay equity analysis to determine we have pay equity across gender and race in similar jobs, accounting for factors such as role, experience, education and level. We also have a Culture Committee and a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Committee comprised of employees across departments, who focus on employee engagement, building a more diverse and inclusive organization, and other initiatives throughout the year.
Compensation and Benefits
We offer competitive compensation to attract and retain the best people. Our total compensation package includes market-competitive salary, bonuses, and equity. We offer full-time employees equity at the time of hire and through annual equity grants because we want them to consider themselves to have an ownership stake in the company and to be committed to our long-term success. We offer a wide range of benefits across areas such as health, family, finance, community, and time off, including healthcare and wellness benefits, a 401(k) plan, access to legal services, and family leave.
Protection and Support of our Employees During the COVID-19 Pandemic
We established a COVID-19 response team which continually monitors the impact of COVID-19 on our operations. The COVID-19 response team manages our workplace protocols that govern our employees’ use of our office. To mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our business, we put in place the following safety measures for our employees, patients, healthcare professionals, and suppliers to limit exposure: We substantially restricted travel, supplied personal protective equipment to employees, limited access to our headquarters and asked most of our staff to work remotely. We supported our employees by maintaining base compensation throughout the year, and our year-end practices around merit, bonus and equity were not impacted. 
As of January 1, 2023, the majority of our employees are still working remotely, which may negatively impact our ability to conduct research and development activities, engage in sales-related initiatives, or efficiently conduct day-to-day operations. In March 2023, we expect our headquarters-based employees will return to the office on a 3-2 hybrid model (3 days in office, 2 days remote). In addition, we added bandwidth and VPN capacity to our infrastructure to facilitate remote work arrangements. We will continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our operations, including how it will impact our employees, clinical trials, development programs, supply chain, and other aspects of our operations, and report to our Board of Directors regularly on the progress of our response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Throughout the outbreak, we continue to build a strong supportive culture around values of patients first, integrity, respect and collaboration. Our efforts to develop our culture will last far beyond this pandemic.
