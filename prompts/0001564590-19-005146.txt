ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview
 We are a global oncology company with a proprietary platform technology called Tumor Treating Fields. Our key priorities are to drive commercial adoption of Optune, our Tumor Treating Fields delivery system, for the treatment of glioblastoma (“GBM”) and to advance programs testing the efficacy and safety of Optune in multiple solid tumor indications through our clinical pipeline.
 Optune is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed GBM in combination with temozolomide, a chemotherapy drug, and for use as monotherapy treatment for adult patients with GBM following confirmed recurrence after chemotherapy. We also have approval to market Optune for the treatment of GBM in the European Union (“EU”), Japan and certain other countries. We have built a commercial organization and launched Optune for the treatment of GBM in the U.S., Austria, Germany, Israel, Japan, Sweden and Switzerland, which we refer to as our currently active markets. 
 Currently, we are planning or conducting phase 3 pivotal trials evaluating the use of Optune in brain metastases, non-small-cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”), pancreatic cancer and ovarian cancer. We are also conducting a phase 2 pilot trial evaluating the use of Optune in liver cancer. In 2018, we successfully completed a phase 2 pilot trial in malignant pleural mesothelioma (“MPM”) and have since submitted a humanitarian device exemption (“HDE”) application to the FDA for approval in MPM. We anticipate expanding our clinical pipeline over time to study the safety and efficacy of Optune for additional solid tumor indications.
 We believe we own global commercialization rights to Optune in oncology. In 2018, we granted Zai Lab (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. (“Zai”) a license to commercialize Optune in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan (“Greater China”) under a License and Collaboration Agreement (the “Zai Agreement”). We believe we have a robust patent and intellectual property portfolio, with over 140 issued patents and numerous patent applications pending worldwide. 
 Our ordinary shares are quoted on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “NVCR.” We were incorporated in the Bailiwick of Jersey in 2000. Our operations are located in the U.S., Austria, Germany, Israel, Japan, Sweden and Switzerland. 
 Our therapy
 Tumor Treating Fields is a cancer therapy that uses electric fields tuned to specific frequencies to disrupt cell division, inhibiting tumor growth and causing affected cancer cells to die. After nearly two decades of preclinical research in 19 different cancer types, Tumor Treating Fields has demonstrated a consistent anti-mitotic effect. In our clinical research and commercial experience to date, Tumor Treating Fields has exhibited no systemic toxicity, with mild to moderate skin irritation being the most common side effect. Tumor Treating Fields is intended principally for use in combination with other standard-of-care cancer treatments.
 Recognizing what electric fields are and how they can be utilized for medical applications is essential to understanding Tumor Treating Fields. An electric field is a field of force. Electric fields surround all charged objects. An electric field exerts forces on charged objects within it. Tumor Treating Fields uses alternating electric fields specifically tuned to target cancer cells. Once the electric fields enter the cancer cell, they attract and repel charged proteins during cancer cell division.
 Tumor Treating Fields utilizes the natural electrical properties of dividing cancer cells. While many intracellular molecules are slightly polarized or neutral, some are highly polarized and are strongly affected by Tumor Treating Fields. Tubulin is a highly polarized cellular protein that must orient spatially to form the mitotic spindle, which segregates chromosomes into two daughter cells during mitosis. In the presence of Tumor Treating Fields, tubulin aligns with the direction of the electric field, causing disruption of mitotic spindle formation and eventual cell death. Septin is another highly polarized molecule in cells that must orient spatially to form the contractile ring needed to split daughter cells during mitosis. In the presence of Tumor Treating Fields, septin aligns with the direction of the electric field, leading to improper localization of the contractile ring. This process causes membrane blebbing, a sign of cell damage that may result in cell death. 
 Research is ongoing to enhance our understanding of the multi-pronged mechanism behind Tumor Treating Fields. We provide independent researchers a preclinical laboratory bench system, known as inovitro™, and we grant funding to support basic and translational research on Tumor Treating Fields. In addition to its anti-mitotic effect, Tumor Treating

Fields has been shown to interfere with DNA damage response, to induce autophagy, to reduce cell migration and invasion and to increase cell membrane permeability and disrupt the blood brain barrier. 
 We believe Tumor Treating Fields causes minimal damage to healthy cells surrounding affected cancer cells. Tumor Treating Fields does not stimulate or heat tissue and targets dividing cancer cells of a specific size. Tumor Treating Fields is regionally delivered to the tumor site rather than systemically delivered throughout the body and, as a result, the parts of the body not covered by Tumor Treating Fields are generally not affected. 
 Our technology
 Treatment with Tumor Treating Fields is delivered through a portable medical device. The complete delivery system, called Optune, includes a portable electric field generator, transducer arrays, rechargeable batteries and accessories. Sterile, single-use transducer arrays are placed directly on the skin in the region surrounding the tumor and connected to the electric field generator to deliver therapy. Transducer arrays are changed when hair growth or the hydrogel reduces array adhesion to the skin. The therapy is designed to be delivered continuously throughout the day and night and efficacy is strongly correlated to time on therapy. If the device is not on, the patient is not being treated. The electric field generator can be run from a standard power outlet or carried with a battery in a specially designed bag that we provide to patients. 
 We plan to use the same field generator technology across all indications for which Optune is approved. We plan to specifically target individual solid tumor types by tuning the field generator to the appropriate frequency based upon tumor cell size and adjusting the output power to treat the required tumor tissue volume. Our transducer arrays have been developed and are in use, either commercially or clinically, for application on the head, chest and abdomen. 
 Through engineering efforts, we plan to continue to enhance Optune to improve ease of use and efficacy for patients. We are developing a next generation transducer array, a second generation Optune torso system and a remote download capability for the monthly usage report. Over time, we may have the opportunity to optimize the energy delivered to individual patients, potentially improving efficacy. Any enhancements will be subject to applicable regulatory reviews and approvals. 
 Our commercial business 
 Optune is currently approved for the treatment of GBM, the most common form of primary brain cancer and an aggressive disease for which there are few effective treatment options. Our first commercial priority in each active market is to generate awareness of Optune and our unprecedented five-year survival data in newly diagnosed GBM.
 EF-14 phase 3 pivotal clinical trial data for the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM
 In 2015, we received FDA approval to market Optune for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed supratentorial GBM in combination with temozolomide. The FDA approved Optune for newly diagnosed GBM based on the EF-14 trial (“EF-14”), which was a randomized, phase 3 pivotal clinical trial which compared, post radiation, Optune plus temozolomide versus temozolomide alone for the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM. The primary endpoint of the trial was progression free survival and a powered secondary endpoint was overall survival. 
 In EF-14, Optune plus temozolomide demonstrated unprecedented five-year survival results. Median overall survival was extended by nearly five months (median overall survival of 20.9 months versus 16.0 months for temozolomide alone). Median progression free survival was extended by 2.7 months to 6.7 months for Optune plus temozolomide from 4.0 months for temozolomide alone. The final EF-14 data were published in JAMA in 2017.

The following graph presents the overall survival data in the intent-to-treat population from our five-year analysis:

The extension of progression free and overall survival in patients receiving Optune in combination with temozolomide in the EF-14 trial was not specific to any prognostic subgroup or tumor genetic marker and was consistent regardless of MGMT methylation status, extent of resection, age, performance status or gender. Optune was safely combined with temozolomide with no significant increase in serious adverse events compared with temozolomide alone. The most common side effect related to Optune was mild to moderate skin irritation.
 In 2018, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology® (NCCN Guidelines®) for Central Nervous Systems Cancers were updated to include alternating electric fields therapy (Optune) in combination with temozolomide following standard brain radiation therapy with concurrent temozolomide as a Category 1 recommended postoperative adjuvant treatment option for patients with newly diagnosed supratentorial GBM.
 A post-hoc analysis of our EF-14 trial showed that more time on Optune predicted increased survival in GBM patients. An Optune monthly usage threshold as low as 50 percent correlated with significantly improved outcomes in patients treated with Optune together with temozolomide compared to patients treated with temozolomide alone. The greater patients’ monthly usage of Optune, the better their outcomes. Patients who used Optune more than 90 percent of the time (n=43) had the greatest chance of survival: a median survival of 24.9 months from randomization and a five-year probability of survival of 29.3 percent.
 In 2018, a separate post-hoc analysis of our EF-14 trial showed that higher levels of energy at the tumor bed predicted increased survival in GBM patients. Patients treated with Optune at higher energy levels (power loss densities greater than or equal to 1.1 mW/cm3; n=122) had a median overall survival of 25.2 months compared to a median overall survival of 21.0 months for patients treated with Optune at lower energy levels (power loss densities less than 1.1 mW/cm3; n=195). 
 In these analyses, both time on therapy and higher levels of energy (or higher power loss density) were associated with improved overall survival, independent of each other. Patients who used Optune more than 20 hours per day at higher energy levels (n=36) had a median overall survival of 37 months (95% CI 21-48 months). For Optune, dose density can be defined as time on therapy times the energy delivered, or cumulative energy
 Quality of life data from a pre-specified analysis of our EF-14 trial demonstrated that patients treated with Optune and temozolomide maintained quality of life over time and across predefined daily-functioning domains. Both healthcare professionals and patients reported stable quality of life evaluation scores up to one year of Optune use. Physical, role, social, emotional and cognitive functioning for patients treated with Optune and temozolomide all remained stable and comparable with the temozolomide alone arm.

EF-11 phase 3 pivotal clinical trial data for the treatment of recurrent GBM
 We initially received FDA approval for Optune in 2011 for use as a monotherapy treatment for adult patients with GBM, following confirmed recurrence after chemotherapy. The FDA approved Optune based on the EF-11 trial (“EF-11”), a randomized, phase 3 pivotal clinical trial. 
 EF-11 was a multicenter, active controlled clinical trial of 237 adults with recurrent GBM. Participants received either Optune as a monotherapy (n=120) or the physician’s choice of chemotherapy (n=117). Chemotherapies chosen for the active control arm included mainly bevacizumab, nitrosureas and temozolomide. The primary endpoint was superiority in overall survival. Overall survival for patients treated with Optune alone and active chemotherapy was 6.6 months and 6.0 months, respectively (p=0.27: HR = 0.86). The trial demonstrated that Optune provided clinically comparable survival with an overall better quality of life.
Twice as many EF-11 patients responded to Optune than to active chemotherapy (12 patients versus 6 patients). Three patients in the Optune alone arm had a complete response versus no patients in the active chemotherapy arm.
 Our markets
 We have received approval to market Optune in the U.S., EU, Japan and certain other countries. We have built a commercial organization and launched Optune for the treatment of GBM in the U.S., Germany, Austria, Sweden, Switzerland, Israel and Japan, which we refer to as our currently active markets. Refer to Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”, Note 18, “Supplemental information” for more information regarding our assets and net revenues. 
 We estimate that approximately:
  
• | 13,800 people are diagnosed with GBM or tumors that typically progress to GBM in the U.S. each year. Of this population, we estimate that approximately 9,300 patients are candidates for treatment with Optune based upon the rate of disease progression and medical eligibility.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 3,900 people are diagnosed with GBM or tumors that typically progress to GBM in Germany each year. Of this population, we estimate that approximately 2,700 patients are candidates for treatment with Optune based upon the rate of disease progression and medical eligibility.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 1,800 people are diagnosed with GBM or tumors that typically progress to GBM in Japan each year. Of this population, we estimate that approximately 1,100 patients are candidates for treatment with Optune based upon the rate of disease progression and medical eligibility.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 1,300 people are diagnosed with GBM or tumors that typically progress to GBM in our other currently active markets: Austria, Israel, Sweden and Switzerland. Of this population, we estimate that approximately 750 patients are candidates for treatment with Optune based upon the rate of disease progression and medical eligibility.

 Commercial execution
 Healthcare providers must undergo a certification training in order to prescribe Optune. As of December 31, 2018, we had more than 65 sales force colleagues globally. In the U.S., we focus our sales and marketing efforts in GBM on neuro-oncologists at academic centers and radiation oncologists in the community setting. In Germany and Japan, neurosurgeons are often the lead prescriber. We believe that radiation oncologists will continue to play an increasingly important role in driving Optune adoption, both for GBM and future indications.
 We currently operate as a direct-to-patient distributor of Optune in all active markets except Japan. Once an appropriate Optune patient is identified by a certified prescriber, the healthcare provider’s office submits a prescription order form and supporting documentation to us. We employ a team of Device Support Specialists who provide technical training to the patient and caregiver. Once treatment is initiated, we provide 24/7 technical support for patients and caregivers as well as assistance with insurance reimbursement. We also provide the healthcare provider and the patient with a monthly usage report for monitoring patient time on therapy. In Japan, we distribute our product through hospitals and provide patient support services under a contractual arrangement with the hospital. We believe we have the experience, expertise and infrastructure to scale our sales and marketing efforts in our key markets. In addition to our commercial organization, we believe we have established a scalable supply chain.

The number of active patients on therapy is our principal revenue driver. An active patient is a patient who is receiving treatment with Optune under a commercial prescription order as of the measurement date, including patients who may be on a temporary break from treatment and who plan to resume treatment in less than 60 days. Growth in the number of active patients is a factor of both new patient starts and treatment duration. Median treatment duration differs based upon the clinical diagnosis of the patient. 
 Prescriptions are a leading indicator of demand. A prescription is a commercial order for Optune that is received from a physician certified to treat patients with Optune for a patient not previously on Optune. Orders to renew or extend treatment are not included in this total. 
 We believe there are many more patients who could benefit from treatment with Optune than are currently on therapy. In 2019, we continue to focus on increasing penetration for GBM in currently active markets. In the future, we anticipate strategically expanding into additional geographic markets and additional indications, pending regulatory approval. 
 Billing and reimbursement
 We provide Optune directly to patients following receipt of a prescription order and a signed patient service agreement. We bill payers a single monthly fee for a month of therapy and we bear the financial risk of securing payment from patients and third-party payers in all markets except for Japan. We distribute our product through hospitals in Japan with the hospitals receiving reimbursement from the government mandated insurance program and in turn contracting with us for the equipment, supplies and services necessary to treat patients with Optune. 
 The monthly list price for Optune is $21,000 in the U.S. and we have set list prices in our other currently active markets that are approximately equivalent to this price subject to currency fluctuations. We typically negotiate discounts from our list price with healthcare payers in order to secure reimbursement for Optune. 
 As of December 31, 2018, more than 243 million Americans had coverage of Optune for newly diagnosed and/or recurrent GBM. Additionally, we had negotiated contracts to establish Optune as an in-network benefit for more than 220 million American lives. The percentage of our U.S. active patient population who are beneficiaries of the Medicare fee-for-service program, which has denied coverage for our claims to date, ranged from 20 to 25 percent in 2018. We are actively appealing Medicare coverage denials through the Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”) process with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”). Our ability to be appropriately reimbursed for Medicaid patients is impacted by the status of Medicare coverage. In June 2018, we submitted a local coverage determination (“LCD”) reconsideration request to the Medicare durable medical equipment (“DME”) Medicare Administrative Contractors (“MACs”). Per CMS and Medicare policy, the two DME MACs will issue a single joint policy applicable in all DME regions. Our decision to file for coverage followed the announcement by CMS that it had developed a methodology that will recognize current commercial pricing for newly covered DME items and that commercial pricing information will be taken into account when establishing a new fee schedule amount. 
 In October 2018, the DME MACs confirmed that they have accepted the LCD reconsideration request for the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM and plan to take steps to publish a final LCD for newly diagnosed GBM. The MACs will not reconsider the LCD for recurrent GBM at this time. The MACs also confirmed that they plan to follow a new and evolving process during the LCD reconsideration, which reflects policy changes in response to 21st Century Cures Act requirements and stakeholder comments. On March 6, 2019, the DME MACs will meet with a contractor advisory committee (“CAC”) prior to publishing a proposed LCD. The purpose of the CAC is to provide a formal mechanism for healthcare professionals to be informed of the evidence used in developing the LCD and promote communications between the MAC and the healthcare community. The CAC is advisory in nature, with the final decision on all issues resting with MACs. The timing of publication of the proposed LCD following the CAC meeting is unclear at this time. Once published, the proposed LCD will be subject to a 45-day public comment period and, following that public comment period, a final LCD will be published. The timing for issuance of a final LCD will depend upon the speed with which the DME MACs respond to (i) input from the CAC and (ii) public comments on the proposed LCD. The LCD will state either positive or no coverage for Optune for the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM. A positive LCD may contain limitations or restrictions regarding coverage of Optune. The LCD will take effect at least 45 days following publication of the final LCD to allow adequate notice to the provider community. 
 In Germany, we bill healthcare payers for individual cases and each case is evaluated individually on its merits and under the payer’s specific rules for such cases. In September 2018, the German Federal Joint Committee (“G-BA”) announced that it will evaluate Optune for newly diagnosed GBM without the need to develop additional evidence through a clinical trial. This decision starts the regular methods evaluation process for newly diagnosed GBM through IQWiG, the German Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Healthcare. We will continue to bill payers for individual cases as we advance through the review process in Germany.

We have received national reimbursement for Optune in Austria, Japan and Sweden. We are pursuing national reimbursement for Optune in Israel and Switzerland.
 Our clinical pipeline
 Based on the results of our preclinical research, we have developed a pipeline strategy to advance Optune through phase 2 pilot and phase 3 pivotal trials across multiple solid tumor types. We anticipate expanding our clinical pipeline over time for additional solid tumor indications.
 Current Clinical Pipeline
 


The solid tumor types subject to our phase 2 pilot and phase 3 pivotal trials are described in greater detail below, as well as additional details regarding these trials.
Mesothelioma
 Malignant pleural mesothelioma is a rare thoracic solid tumor cancer that has been strongly linked to asbestos exposure. It has a long latency period of at least 20-30 years following exposure, and global incidence is still increasing in countries where asbestos is still in use. There are approximately 3,000 new cases of MPM annually in the U.S. . The prognosis of MPM patients is very poor, with a median overall survival of approximately 12 months in most reported studies. Of the 3,000 Americans diagnosed with MPM annually, only 9% are alive five years later. 
 Physicians use different combinations of surgery and pharmacological therapies to treat MPM, depending on the stage of the disease. Surgery may be used for patients with early stage disease. However, most cases are diagnosed once the cancer is at a later stage, involving extensive tumor growth and regional lymph node spread, and surgical resection for the treatment of MPM is feasible for only a minority of patients. First line standard of care treatment includes the chemotherapy pemetrexed in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy, including carboplatin or cisplatin. Second-line treatments may include the chemotherapies gemcitabine or vinorelbine or immunotherapies. Despite the many advances in chemotherapy made in recent decades, treatment effectiveness remains very limited.
 Phase 2 registration trial
 In September 2018, we presented the results of our STELLAR trial, a phase 2 registration trial in MPM. The STELLAR trial was a single-arm, open-label, multi-center trial designed to test the efficacy and safety of Optune in combination with pemetrexed combined with cisplatin or carboplatin in patients with unresectable, previously untreated MPM. The historical control for this trial was the results of the 2003 pemetrexed phase 3 FDA registration trial.
 The STELLAR data demonstrated a significant extension in median overall survival among patients treated with Optune plus standard of care chemotherapy compared to historical control data of patients who received standard of care chemotherapy alone. MPM patients who received Optune with pemetrexed and cisplatin or carboplatin experienced median overall survival of 18.2 months (95 percent CI, 12.1-25.8 months) compared to 12.1 months in a historical control. Secondary endpoints were also improved compared to the historical control. Patients who received Optune with pemetrexed and cisplatin or carboplatin experienced a median progression free survival of 7.6 months (95% CI, 6.7-9.8 months) compared to 5.6 months in a historical control. Partial responses were seen in 40.3% of patients and clinical benefit, either partial response or stable disease, was seen in 97.2% of patients. No serious device-related adverse events were reported.

In October 2018, we submitted a HDE application to the FDA for approval in MPM. We have received comments from the FDA and are currently preparing our response. We cannot be certain what pre-approval or post-approval studies, if any, the FDA may request to support our HDE application. Pending regulatory approval, we anticipate a 2019 launch in the United States.
 Devices approved under an HDE application are subject to certain requirements, including potential profit limitations. We believe that it is likely that the FDA will determine that Tumor Treating Fields for the treatment of MPM meets the eligibility criteria to obtain an exemption from this profit limitation.
 Brain metastases
 Metastatic cancer is cancer that has spread from the place where it first started to another place in the body. In metastasis, cancer cells break away from where they first formed (the primary cancer), travel through the blood or lymph system, and form new tumors (the metastatic tumors) in other parts of the body. The exact incidence of brain metastases is unknown because no national cancer registry documents brain metastases. However, it has been estimated that 200,000 new cases are diagnosed in the U.S. each year. Brain metastases occur in roughly 15% of all cancer patients, and we believe that approximately 40% of brain metastases are a result of NSCLC.
 Brain metastases are commonly treated with a combination of surgery and radiation. Chemotherapy is often given for the primary tumor, but many chemotherapy agents do not cross the blood brain barrier and are thus ineffective in the treatment of brain metastases. When brain metastases appear, they are either surgically removed or treated with radiation using stereotactic radiosurgery (“SRS”) when possible. Whole brain radiation therapy, although effective in delaying progression or recurrence of brain metastases when given either before or after SRS, is associated with neurotoxicity with a significant decline in cognitive and emotional functioning. Thus, whole brain radiation therapy is often delayed until later in the disease course and is often used as a last resort. This practice results in a window of unmet need after localized surgery and SRS are used and before whole brain radiation therapy is administered to delay or prevent the additional spread of brain metastases. 
 Phase 3 pivotal trial
 In 2016, we enrolled the first patient in our METIS trial, a phase 3 pivotal trial testing the effectiveness of SRS plus Optune compared to SRS alone in patients with brain metastases resulting from NSCLC. The primary endpoint of the METIS trial is time to first cerebral progression. Secondary endpoints include, among others, time to neurocognitive failure, overall survival and radiological response rate following study treatments. We have opened the trial to 270 patients and anticipate data will be available in 2021. 
 Non-small cell lung cancer
 Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and NSCLC accounts for approximately 85% of all lung cancers. The incidence of NSCLC is approximately 194,000 new cases annually in the U.S., approximately 400,000 new cases annually in Europe, and approximately 109,000 new cases annually in Japan. 
 Physicians use different combinations of surgery, radiation and pharmacological therapies to treat NSCLC, depending on the stage of the disease. Surgery, which may be curative in a subset of patients, is usually used in early stages of the disease. Since 1991, radiation with a combination of platinum-based chemotherapy drugs has been the first line standard of care for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Certain immune checkpoint inhibitors have recently been approved for the first line treatment of NSCLC and the standard of care in this setting appears to be evolving rapidly. The standard of care for second line treatment is also evolving and may include may include platinum based chemotherapy for patients who received immune checkpoint inhibitors as their first line regimen, pemetrexed, docetaxel or immune checkpoint inhibitors. 
 Phase 2 pilot trial
 In 2013, we published the results of our phase 2 pilot trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of Optune in the treatment of advanced NSCLC. The pilot study focused on the effects of treatment with Optune in combination with standard of care pemetrexed chemotherapy. Results of the pemetrexed Phase 3 FDA registration trial were used as a historical control in this trial.

A total of 42 patients were recruited to the study with a minimum follow-up of six months. Efficacy results based on 41 evaluable patients showed both progression free survival and overall survival for patients receiving Optune in combination with pemetrexed increased compared to historical control data for pemetrexed alone. Median progression free survival in the Optune-treated group was 6.5 months (compared to 2.9 months in the historical control) and median overall survival was 13.8 months (compared to 8.3 months in the historical control). Adverse events reported in this combination study were comparable to those reported with pemetrexed alone, suggesting minimal added toxicities due to Optune. 
 Phase 3 pivotal trial
 In 2017, we enrolled the first patient in our LUNAR trial, a phase 3 pivotal trial testing the effectiveness of Optune in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors or docetaxel versus immune checkpoint inhibitors or docetaxel alone for patients who progressed during or after platinum based therapy. The primary endpoint is superior overall survival of patients treated with Optune plus immune checkpoint inhibitors or docetaxel versus immune checkpoint inhibitors or docetaxel alone. In addition, the trial will test non-inferiority in overall survival of patients treated with Optune plus docetaxel versus immune checkpoint inhibitors alone. We believe our protocol incorporates the evolving standard of care for second-line treatment of NSCLC. 
 We have opened the trial to 534 patients and anticipate final data will be available in 2021. The protocol specifies an event-driven interim analysis, which we anticipate will occur in 2020. 
 Pancreatic cancer
 Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal cancers and is the third most frequent cause of death from cancer in the U.S. While overall cancer incidence and death rates are declining, the incidence and death rates for pancreatic cancer are increasing. The incidence of pancreatic cancer is approximately 55,000 new cases annually in the U.S., approximately 132,500 new cases annually in Europe, and approximately 40,000 new cases annually in Japan. Pancreatic cancer is the only major cancer with a five-year relative survival rate in the single digits, at just 8 percent.
 Physicians use different combinations of surgery, radiation and pharmacological therapies to treat pancreatic cancer, depending on the stage of the disease. For patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer involving encasement of arteries but no extra-pancreatic disease, the standard of care is surgery followed by chemotherapy with or without radiation. Unfortunately, the majority of locally advanced cases are diagnosed once the cancer is no longer operable, generally leaving chemotherapy with or without radiation as the only treatment option. 
 Phase 2 pilot trial
 In 2018 we published the results of our phase 2 pilot trial in advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma, the PANOVA trial, examining Optune in combination with standard of care chemotherapy. 
 The PANOVA trial was a multicenter, non-randomized, open-label trial. The trial included 40 patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer whose tumors could not be removed surgically and who had not received chemotherapy or radiation therapy prior to the clinical trial. Patients were enrolled between 2014 and 2016 in two cohorts: The first cohort of 20 patients received standard doses of gemcitabine alone. The second cohort of 20 patients received standard doses of nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine. 
 In the first cohort, efficacy results showed that progression free survival and overall survival of patients treated with Optune combined with gemcitabine were more than double those of gemcitabine-treated historical controls. Median progression free survival in the Optune-treated group was 8.3 months (compared to 3.7 months in the gemcitabine historical control), with locally advanced patients reaching a median progression free survival of 10.3 months and patients with metastatic disease reaching a median progression free survival of 5.7 months. The median overall survival for all patients was 14.9 months (compared to 6.7 months in the gemcitabine historical control). Median overall survival was longer than 15 months in locally advanced patients and 86% of patients were alive at end of follow up. Patients with metastatic disease experienced a median overall survival of 8.3 months. Median one-year survival was 55% (compared to 22% in the gemcitabine historical control). Of 11 patients with available CT scans, 5 (45%) had a partial response (compared to 7% with gemcitabine alone), 5 (45%) had stable disease, which means that the cancer is neither decreasing nor increasing in extent or severity, and 1 (10%) had progressive disease.

In the second cohort, efficacy results showed that progression free survival and overall survival of patients treated with Optune combined with nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine were more than double those of nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine-treated historical controls. Median progression free survival in the Optune-treated group was 12.7 months (compared to 5.5 months in the nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine historical control) and median overall survival was not yet reached. The one-year survival rate was 72% (compared to 35% in nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine historical control).  Of the 15 patients with available CT scans, 6 (40%) had a partial response (compared to 23% with the nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine alone), 7 (47%) had stable disease and 2 (13%) had progressive disease.
 Safety results from both cohorts suggested that Optune plus first-line chemotherapies nab-paclitaxel and/or gemcitabine may be tolerable and safe in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Patients reported no serious adverse events related to Optune.
 Phase 3 pivotal trial
 In 2018, we enrolled the first patient in our PANOVA-3 trial, a phase 3 pivotal trial testing the effectiveness of Optune with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine as a front-line treatment for unresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer. The primary endpoint of the PANOVA-3 trial is overall survival. Secondary endpoints include progression free survival, local progression free survival, objective response rate, one-year survival rate, quality of life, pain-free survival, resectability rate and toxicity.
 We have opened the trial to 556 patients and anticipate final data will be available in 2022. US Oncology Research is collaborating with us on the trial and plans to open 10 clinical trial sites. The protocol specifies an event-driven interim analysis, which we anticipate will occur in 2021. 
 Ovarian cancer
 In the U.S., ovarian cancer ranks fifth in cancer deaths among women, accounting for more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system. Ovarian cancer incidence increases with age, and the median age at time of diagnosis is 63 years old. The incidence of ovarian cancer is approximately 22,500 new cases annually in the U.S., approximately 68,000 new cases annually in Europe, and approximately 10,000 new cases annually in Japan.
 Physicians use different combinations of surgery and pharmacological therapies to treat ovarian cancer, depending on the stage of the disease. Surgery is usually used in early stages of the disease and is usually combined with chemotherapy, including paclitaxel and platinum-based chemotherapy. Unfortunately, the majority of patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage when the cancer has spread outside of the ovaries to include regional tissue involvement and/or metastases. Platinum-based chemotherapy remains the standard of care in advanced ovarian cancer, but most patients with advanced ovarian cancer will have tumor progression or, more commonly, recurrence. Almost all patients with recurrent disease ultimately develop platinum resistance, and the prognosis for this population remains poor. 
 Phase 2 pilot trial
 In 2018, we published the results of our phase 2 pilot trial in recurrent ovarian cancer, the INNOVATE trial, examining Optune in combination with standard of care chemotherapy. This trial was a multicenter, non-randomized, open-label trial designed to test the feasibility, safety and preliminary efficacy of Optune in combination with weekly paclitaxel. The paclitaxel control arm from the bevacizumab phase 3 FDA registration trial was used as a historical control in this trial. 
 A total of 31 patients were recruited to the study with a minimum follow-up of six months. Safety results suggested that Optune in combination with weekly paclitaxel may be tolerable and safe as second-line treatment for patients with recurrent ovarian cancer. Median progression free survival in the Optune-treated group was 8.9 months (compared to 3.9 months in the paclitaxel-alone historical control) and median overall survival was not yet reached. The one-year survival rate was 61%. Efficacy results based on the 31 evaluable patients suggested more than doubling of the progression free survival and an improvement in overall survival among patients who received Optune therapy with paclitaxel compared to paclitaxel alone.

Phase 3 pivotal trial
 Based on our phase 2 pilot trial results, we expect to commence a phase 3 pivotal trial in recurrent ovarian cancer in 2019. The INNOVATE-3 trial will test the efficacy of Optune with paclitaxel in patients with recurrent, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. The primary endpoint of the INNOVATE-3 trial is overall survival. Secondary endpoints include progression free survival, objective response rate, severity and frequency of adverse events, time to undisputable deterioration in health-related quality of life or death, and quality of life.
 Liver cancer
 Liver cancer is a leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide and is the seventh leading cause of cancer deaths annually in the U.S. The incidence of liver cancer is approximately 42,000 new cases annually in the U.S., approximately 82,000 new cases annually in Europe, and approximately 42,000 new cases annually in Japan. The five-year survival rate with existing standards of care is less than 18%.
 Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most widespread type of cancer that originates from the liver. Advanced liver cancer has spread either to the lymph nodes or to other organs and, because these cancers are widespread, they cannot be treated with surgery. The current common standard treatment for patients with advanced disease and those who progressed on loco-regional therapy is systemic therapy with sorafenib. 
 Phase 2 pilot trial
 In 2018, we opened our HEPANOVA trial, a single-arm, phase 2 pilot clinical trial in liver cancer testing the efficacy and safety of Optune in combination with sorafenib for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular cancer that are not eligible for standard local therapies or surgery. The trial is expected to enroll a total of 25 patients in multiple centers across Europe and we anticipate data will be available in 2020. The primary endpoint is overall radiological response rates and secondary endpoints include progression-free and overall survival at one year. 
 Zai License and Collaboration Agreement
 In September 2018, we announced a strategic collaboration with Zai. The collaboration agreement grants Zai a license to commercialize Optune in Greater China and establishes a development partnership intended to accelerate the development of Optune in multiple solid tumor indications. For additional information, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Manufacturing and supply chain
 We outsource production of all of our system components to qualified partners. Disposable transducer array manufacturing, the dominant activity in our manufacturing supply chain, includes several specialized processes. Production of the durable system components follows standard electronic medical device methodologies.
 We have supply agreements in place with our third-party manufacturing partners. While we currently obtain some critical materials for use in certain jurisdictions from single source suppliers, we have developed or are in the process of developing and obtaining regulatory approval for second sources for critical materials in all jurisdictions. We hold safety stocks of single source components in quantities that we believe are sufficient to protect against possible supply chain disruptions. We anticipate that the diversification of our supply chain will both ensure a continuity of supply and reduce costs. 
 Intellectual property
 We believe we own global commercialization rights to Optune in oncology. Our robust global patent and intellectual property portfolio consists of over 140 issued patents covering various aspects of Tumor Treating Fields and Optune. In the U.S., our patents have expected expiration dates between 2021 and 2037. We have also filed over 80 additional patent applications worldwide that, if issued, may protect aspects of our platform beyond the current last-to-expire patent in the relevant market. Our reliance on intellectual property involves certain risks, as described under the heading “Risk factors—Risks relating to intellectual property.”
 10


In addition to our patent portfolio, we further protect our intellectual property by maintaining the confidentiality of our trade secrets, know-how and other confidential information. Given the length of time and expense associated with bringing delivery systems candidates through development and regulatory approval to the market place, the healthcare industry has traditionally placed considerable importance on obtaining patent protection and maintaining trade secrets, know-how and other confidential information for significant new technologies, products and processes. 
 Our policy is to require each of our employees, consultants and advisors to execute a confidentiality agreement before beginning their employment, consulting or advisory relationship with us. These agreements generally provide that the individual must keep confidential and not disclose to other parties any confidential information developed or learned by the individual during the course of their relationship with us except in limited circumstances. These agreements also generally provide that we own, or the individual is required to assign to us, all inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us. Despite measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may copy certain aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we believe is proprietary.
 As a result of our strategic collaboration with Zai, Zai holds a license to commercialize Optune in Greater China. For additional information, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 In 2015, we entered into a settlement agreement with the Technion Research and Development Foundation to resolve certain potential disputes regarding intellectual property developed by our founder and previously assigned to us. For additional information, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 In 2005, we granted an exclusive license to a third party, NovoBiotic LLC, to certain of our key intellectual property for use outside the field of oncology. We are not entitled to any future revenues from this license. 
 Competition
 The market for cancer treatments is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product and treatment introductions and other activities of industry participants. The general bases of competition are overall effectiveness, side effect profile, cost, availability of reimbursement and general market acceptance of a product as a suitable cancer treatment.
 We believe our intellectual property rights would provide an obstacle to the introduction of Tumor Treating Fields delivery systems by a competitor, and we intend to protect and enforce our intellectual property. In addition, even after the expiration of our U.S. patents, we believe that potential U.S. market entrants applying low-intensity, alternating electric fields to solid tumors in the U.S. will have to undertake their own clinical trials and regulatory submissions to prove equivalence to Optune, a necessary step in receiving regulatory approvals for a competing product.
 Presently, the traditional biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical technology industries expend significant resources in developing novel and proprietary therapies for the treatment of solid tumors, including GBM, MPM and other indications that we are currently investigating. As we work to increase market acceptance of Optune, we compete with companies commercializing or investigating other anti-cancer therapies, some of which are in clinical trials for GBM that currently specifically exclude patients who have been or are being treated with Optune. The introduction of competing therapies could materially impact our business and financial results.
 Government regulation
 Optune and our operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and by agencies and notified bodies of the countries or regions in which we develop and market Optune. In addition, Optune must meet the requirements of a large and growing body of international standards that govern the preclinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, certification, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion, export and marketing and distribution, among other things, of Tumor Treating Fields and Optune for current and future indications.
 In the U.S., advertising and promotion of medical devices, in addition to being regulated by the FDA, are also regulated by the Federal Trade Commission and by state regulatory and enforcement authorities. Promotional activities for FDA-regulated products of other companies have been the subject of enforcement action brought under healthcare reimbursement laws and consumer protection statutes. In addition, under the federal Lanham Act and similar state laws, competitors and others can initiate litigation relating to unfair competition based on advertising claims. In addition, we are required to meet analogous regulatory requirements in countries outside the U.S., which can change rapidly with relatively short notice.
 11


Our research, development and clinical programs, as well as our manufacturing and marketing operations, are also subject to extensive regulation. 
 Failure by us or by our suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, which may result in any number of regulatory enforcement actions, or civil or criminal liability.
 Food and Drug Administration
 The FDA regulates the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, promotion, marketing, distribution and service of medical devices in the U.S. to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. In addition, the FDA regulates the export of medical devices manufactured in the U.S. to international markets and the importation of medical devices manufactured abroad. The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers to ensure compliance with the FDCA.
 The FDA governs the following activities that we perform or that are performed on our behalf:
  
• | product design, development and manufacture;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | product safety, testing, labeling and storage;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | record keeping procedures;
--+---------------------------


• | product marketing, sales and distribution; and
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | post-marketing surveillance, complaint handling, medical device reporting, reporting of deaths, serious injuries or device malfunctions and repair or recall of products.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have registered three of our facilities with the FDA. We are subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with the Quality System Regulation (“QSR”) and other regulations and these inspections include the manufacturing facilities of our suppliers.
 FDA’s premarket clearance and approval requirements
 Unless an exemption applies, before we can commercially distribute medical devices in the U.S., we must obtain, depending on the type of device, either prior 510(k) clearance or premarket approval (“PMA”) from the FDA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices deemed to pose lower risks are placed in either class I or II, which typically requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a premarket notification requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. This process is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Some low-risk devices are exempted from this requirement. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in class III, generally requiring PMA approval.
 Premarket approval (PMA) pathway
 Optune, which is the only delivery system we have marketed in the U.S., is classified as a Class III device as it is deemed a life-sustaining device. Accordingly, we were required to receive PMA approval for Optune, which the FDA granted in April 2011 and October 2015 for the treatment of recurrent and newly diagnosed supratentorial GBM, respectively, in adult patients. We expect that we will be required to receive PMA approval for the use of Optune for future indications. 
 A PMA must be supported by extensive data, including from technical tests, preclinical studies and clinical trials, manufacturing information and intended labeling to demonstrate, to the FDA’s satisfaction, the safety and effectiveness of a medical device for its intended use. During the PMA review period, the FDA will typically request additional information or clarification of the information already provided. Also, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panel’s recommendation. In addition, the FDA will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with QSRs. Prior to approval of the Optune PMA for the treatment of recurrent GBM, we and our critical component suppliers were each inspected by the FDA. 
 12


New PMAs or PMA supplements are required for modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of our delivery systems, including, for example, certain types of modifications to a delivery system’s indication for use, manufacturing process, labeling and design. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA and may not require any or as extensive clinical data as the original PMA required, or the convening of an advisory panel. The FDA requires a company to make the determination as to whether a new PMA or PMA supplement application is to be filed. If a company determines that neither a new PMA nor a PMA supplement application is required for modifications, it must nevertheless notify the FDA of these modifications in its PMA Annual Report. The FDA may review a company’s decisions when reviewing the PMA Annual Report and require the filing of an application. 
 As is typical with medical device companies, we have received approval for a number of post-approval PMA supplements for GBM, including for modifications to Optune’s electric field generator, transducer arrays, software, manufacturing processes and labeling. Future modifications may be considered by us as the need arises, some of which we may deem to require a PMA supplement application and others to require reporting in our PMA Annual Report. 
 For class III devices intended to treat disease affecting 8,000 individuals or less per year in the U.S., called Humanitarian Use Devices (“HUD”), the FDA has a separate marketing authorization pathway called the HDE. Approval basis for an HDE is a “reasonable assurance of safety” and that the probable benefit to health outweighs risk of injury from its use, which means a traditional phase 3 pivotal trial usually is not required to support approval. There are additional procedural issues for HUDs approved under an HDE, including, but not limited to, IRB approval for use in each hospital or facility, and specific labeling requirements. 
 Devices approved under an HDE application are subject to certain requirements, including potential profit limitations. We believe that it is likely that the FDA will determine that Tumor Treating Fields for the treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma meets the eligibility criteria to obtain an exemption from this profit limitation. Otherwise, HDE approved devices are generally required to follow the same requirements as PMA approved devices. In 2018, we submitted an HDE application to the FDA for approval in MPM.
 Clinical trials
 Clinical trials are generally required to support approval of a PMA or HDE. Such trials generally require an IDE approval from the FDA for a specified number of patients and study sites, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements. Clinical trials are subject to extensive monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Clinical trials must be conducted under the oversight of an institutional review board (“IRB”) for the relevant clinical trial sites and must comply with FDA regulations, including those relating to good clinical practices. To conduct a clinical trial, we also are required to obtain the patients’ informed consent in form and substance that complies with both FDA requirements and state and federal privacy and human subject protection regulations. We, the FDA or the respective IRB could suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain FDA approval to market the product in the U.S.
 Post-approval studies are also typically required as a condition of PMA approval to reinforce the reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Such studies are conducted in the post-market setting with the approved device, often to address the long-term use of the device or other discrete questions that may have been raised based on the clinical data from the IDE clinical study. The FDA required a post-approval registry study as a condition of approval for Optune for recurrent GBM. We have obtained approval of the protocol for this study and the study is fully enrolled.
 Foreign approvals and CE mark
 Sales and marketing of medical devices outside of the U.S. are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. These include the requirement to affix a CE mark to our medical devices in the EU. Whether or not we have obtained FDA approval, our delivery systems must be subject to conformity assessment procedure in which a third party notified body can be involved. Apart from low risk medical devices (Class I with no measuring function and which are not sterile), where the manufacturer can issue a declaration of conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the Essential Requirements laid down in the Medical Devices Directive, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body. The notified body typically audits and examines products’ technical file and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of our devices before issuing a CE Certificate of Conformity demonstrating compliance with the relevant Essential Requirements or the quality system requirements laid down in the relevant Annexes to the Medical Devices Directive. Following the issuance of this 
 13


CE Certificate of Conformity, we can draw up a declaration of conformity and affix the CE mark to the delivery systems covered by this CE Certificate of Conformity and the declaration of conformity. The time required to CE mark our delivery systems or to obtain approval from other foreign authorities may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. Pursuant to a mutual recognition agreement, our products bearing a CE mark may be exported to Switzerland. In the EU, a clinical study must receive a positive opinion from a local ethics committee and approval from the competent authority in the applicable EU member states in which the clinical study is conducted. When a clinical study relates to a CE marked medical device that will be used as part of the study according to its CE mark intended purpose, the approval of the competent authorities is not required. In Japan, we must obtain approvals from the MHLW to market our delivery systems. Each regulatory approval process outside of the U.S. includes all the risks associated with FDA regulation, as well as country-specific regulations.
 Pervasive and continuing regulation
 After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply depending upon the country in which the device is being marketed. These may include:
  
• | product listing and establishment registration, which helps facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory action;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process for products marketed in the U.S.;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | labeling regulations and FDA and equivalent competent authority in other jurisdictions requiring promotion is truthful and non-misleading and prohibiting the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label uses;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval of product modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of one of our delivery systems that has been approved or is the subject of a CE Certificate of Conformity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Medical Device Reporting regulations of the FDCA and medical device vigilance, which require that manufacturers comply with FDA or equivalent competent authority requirements in other jurisdictions to report if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device were to recur;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the FDA’s and equivalent competent authority’s recall authority, whereby they can ask, or under certain conditions order, device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | regulations pertaining to voluntary recalls; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | notices of corrections or removals.
--+------------------------------------

 Our delivery systems could be subject to voluntary recall if we, the FDA or another applicable regulatory authority determine, for any reason, that our delivery systems pose a risk of injury or are otherwise defective. Moreover, the FDA and other applicable regulatory authorities can order a mandatory recall if there is a reasonable probability that our delivery system would cause serious adverse health consequences or death.
 The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. We are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with the QSR and other regulations, and these inspections include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. We are also subject to FDA’s broad regulatory enforcement power around promotional activities. Failure by us or by our suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities, which may result in sanctions, including, but not limited to:
  
• | untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | customer notifications for repair, replacement and/or refunds;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | recall, detention or seizure of our delivery systems;
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 14


 
• | refusing or delaying our requests for approval of delivery system candidates or a modified version of Optune;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | withdrawal of PMA/HDE approvals or suspension, variation or withdrawal of CE Certificates of Conformity that have already been granted;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal to grant export approval for our delivery systems; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | civil and/or criminal prosecution by the U.S. Department of Justice or other enforcement authorities outside of the U.S.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To date, our facility and those of our critical suppliers have been inspected by the FDA in order to obtain FDA approval of Optune. No inspectional observations were identified and no FDA Form 483s were issued following these inspections.
 DME accreditation and licensing and other requirements
 In the U.S., we are subject to accreditation and licensing requirements as a DME supplier in most states and must meet the supplier standards of Medicare, Medicaid and other federal programs. Certain states require that DME providers maintain an in-state location. Although we believe we are in compliance with all applicable federal and state regulations regarding accreditation and licensure requirements and similar requirements in other jurisdictions, if we are found to be noncompliant, we could lose our accreditation or licensure in that state or our supplier rights with that federal program, which could prohibit us from selling our current or future delivery systems to patients in that state or to that federal program.
 Healthcare regulatory matters
 In addition to FDA restrictions on the marketing of medical devices, several other types of U.S. federal and state laws have been applied to restrict certain business practices in the healthcare industry and penalize unlawful conduct. These laws include the Anti-Kickback Statute, prohibition on self-referral and the False Claims Act.
 The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between device manufacturers on one hand and prescribers and purchasers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce ordering, purchasing or recommending of a medical device may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. In some cases, our practices may not meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability. Similarly, we are also subject to the prohibition on offering any remuneration to a beneficiary of Medicare, Medicaid or any other federally financed healthcare program that is likely to influence that beneficiary’s choice of therapy. This can include, but is not limited to, inappropriate provision of patient services including financial assistance. Recent government investigations have focused on this particular prohibition. There are established safe harbors from liability, but we cannot guarantee that all of our practices will fall squarely within those safe harbors.
 As a DME supplier, we also are subject to a U.S. federal self-referral law, commonly known as the Stark law, which prohibits Medicare payments for DME ordered by physicians who, personally or through an immediate family member, have ownership interests in or compensation arrangements with the furnishing supplier. The Stark law contains a number of specific exceptions that, if met, permit physicians who have certain financial relationships with a DME supplier to make referrals to that entity.
 The False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. The government has pursued a number of cases under the False Claims Act in connection with the off-label promotion of medical products and various other health care law violations.
 The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback, self-referral and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, that apply regardless of the payer.
 15


Numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, govern the collection, dissemination, use, security and privacy of individually identifiable health information. We believe we are in substantial compliance with such applicable laws and regulations, including HIPAA.
 HIPAA also included a number of federal criminal provisions, including for healthcare fraud and for false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud provision prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers. The false statements provision prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Many states have similar healthcare fraud laws or insurance fraud laws that apply to claims for healthcare reimbursement.
 Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer’s products from reimbursement under government programs, criminal fines and imprisonment.
 Legislation similar to U.S. anti-kickback, self-referral and false claims statutes have been adopted in foreign countries, including a number of EU member states.
 In the EU the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) went into effect May 25, 2018. GDPR is designed to harmonize data privacy laws for both patient and employee data across Europe and which replaced Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of October 24, 1995, and applicable national laws. The GDPR has added a number of strict data protection and security requirements for companies processing personal data of EU citizens. 
 In the U.S., the Sunshine Act requires manufacturers of drugs, medical devices, biologicals or medical supplies that participate in U.S. federal health care programs to track and then report certain payments and items of value given to U.S. physicians and U.S. teaching hospitals, which are defined as Covered Recipients. The Sunshine Act requires that manufacturers collect this information on a yearly basis and then report it to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services by the 90th day of each subsequent year. We have adopted policies and codes of conduct regarding our interactions with Covered Recipients and believe we are in material compliance with the Sunshine Act. However, our failure to adhere to these requirements could materially adversely impact our business and financial results. Additionally, regulations similar to the Sunshine Act have been adopted in foreign countries including a number of EU member states.
 In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business outside the U.S. or to influence a person working in an official capacity in a foreign country. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any official of another country, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in that capacity. Legislation similar to the FCPA has been adopted in foreign countries, including a number of EU member states.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 598 employees. We believe relations with our employees are good.
