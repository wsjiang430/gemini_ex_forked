Item 1. Business.
General
Headquartered in Norfolk, Virginia and incorporated in Delaware, we are a global financial and business services company with operations in the Americas and Europe.
Our primary business is the purchase, collection and management of portfolios of nonperforming loans. The accounts we acquire are primarily the unpaid obligations of individuals owed to credit grantors, which include banks and other types of consumer, retail, and auto finance companies. We acquire portfolios of nonperforming loans in two broad categories: Core and Insolvency. Our Core operation specializes in purchasing and collecting nonperforming loans, which we purchased at a discount to face value since either the credit grantor and/or other third-party collection agencies have been unsuccessful in collecting the full balance owed. Our Insolvency operation consists primarily of purchasing and collecting on nonperforming loan accounts where the customer is involved in a bankruptcy proceeding. We also provide fee-based services on class action claims recoveries and by servicing consumer bankruptcy accounts in the U.S.
We have one reportable segment, accounts receivable management, based on similarities among the operating units, including the nature of the products and services, the nature of the production processes, the types or classes of customers for our products and services, the methods used to distribute our products and services, and the nature of the regulatory environment.
We were initially formed as Portfolio Recovery Associates, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company, on March 20, 1996. We formed Portfolio Recovery Associates, Inc. in August 2002 in order to become a publicly traded company and our common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market ("NASDAQ") on November 8, 2002. We changed our legal name to PRA Group, Inc. on October 23, 2014.
We acquired Aktiv Kapital AS ("Aktiv"), a Norway-based company specializing in the purchase, collection and management of portfolios of nonperforming loans throughout Europe and Canada, on July 16, 2014. On April 26, 2016, we acquired DTP S.A. ("DTP"), a Polish-based debt collection company, further building our in-house collection efforts in Poland.
We expanded into South America on August 3, 2015 by acquiring 55% of the equity interest in RCB Investimentos S.A. ("RCB"), a servicing platform for nonperforming loans in Brazil, with the remaining 45% of the equity interest retained by the executive team and previous owners of RCB. On December 20, 2018, we entered into a strategic partnership with Banco Bradesco S.A. (“Bradesco”), under which Bradesco purchased 79% of our interest in RCB's servicing platform. RCB will continue to be operated by RCB’s founders together with Bradesco. PRA retained an 11.7% equity interest in RCB's servicing platform. The sale did not impact the nonperforming loan purchasing business that we have established in Brazil in partnership with the previous owners of RCB, as it was not part of the sale to Bradesco. Accordingly, we will continue to use RCB to service our portfolios of nonperforming loans in South America.

Nonperforming Loan Portfolio Purchases
To identify buying opportunities, we maintain an extensive marketing effort with our senior officers contacting known and prospective sellers of nonperforming loans. From these sellers, we have purchased a variety of nonperforming loans including Visa® and MasterCard® credit cards, private label and other credit cards, installment loans, lines of credit, deficiency balances of various types, legal judgments, and trade payables. Sellers of nonperforming loans include major banks, credit unions, consumer finance companies, telecommunication providers, retailers, utilities, automobile finance companies, student loan companies, and other debt owners. The price at which we acquire portfolios depends on the age of the portfolio, whether it is a Core or Insolvency portfolio, geographic distribution, the seller's selection criteria, our historical experience with a certain asset type or credit grantor, and other similar factors.

Nonperforming Loan Portfolio Purchasing Process
We acquire portfolios of nonperforming loans from credit grantors through auctions and negotiated sales. In an auction process, the seller will assemble a portfolio of nonperforming loans and will seek purchase prices from specifically invited potential purchasers. In a privately negotiated sale process, the credit grantor will contact one or more purchasers directly, receive a bid, and negotiate the terms of sale. In either case, typically, invited purchasers will have already successfully completed a qualification process that can include the seller's review of any or all of the following: the purchaser's experience, reputation, financial standing, operating procedures, business practices, and compliance oversight.
We acquire portfolios of nonperforming loans through either single portfolio transactions, referred to as spot sales, or through the pre-arranged purchase of multiple portfolios over time, referred to as forward flow sales. Under a forward flow contract, we agree to purchase nonperforming loans from credit grantors on a periodic basis, at a price equal to a set percentage of face value of the nonperforming loans over a specified time period, generally from three to twelve months.
Nonperforming Loan Portfolio Collection Operations
Call Center Operations
In higher volume markets, our collection efforts leverage internally staffed call centers. In some newer markets or in markets that have less consistent debt purchasing patterns, most notably outside the U.S., we may utilize external vendors to do some of this work. Whether the accounts are being worked internally or externally, we utilize our proprietary analysis to proportionally direct work efforts to those customers most likely to pay. The analysis driving those decisions relies on various models and variables that have the highest correlation to profitable collections from call activity.
Legal Recovery - Core Portfolios
An important component of our collections effort involves our legal recovery operations and the judicial collection of accounts of customers who we believe have the ability, but not the willingness, to resolve their obligations. There are some markets in which the collection process follows a prescribed time-sensitive and sequential set of legal actions, but in the majority of instances, we use models and analysis to select those accounts reflecting a high propensity to pay in a legal environment. Depending on the characteristics of the receivable and the applicable local collection laws, we determine whether to commence legal action to judicially collect on the receivable. The legal process can take an extended period of time and can be costly, but when accounts are selected properly it also usually generates net cash collections that likely would not have been realized otherwise. We use a combination of internal staff (attorney and support), and external staff to pursue legal collections under certain circumstances. 
Insolvency Operations
Insolvency Operations in the U.S. manages customer filings under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on debtor accounts derived from two sources: (1) our purchased pools of bankrupt accounts and (2) our Core purchased pools of nonperforming loans that have filed for bankruptcy protection after being acquired by us. We file proofs of claim ("POCs") or claim transfers and actively manage these accounts through the entire life cycle of the bankruptcy proceeding to substantiate our claims and ensure that we participate in any distributions to creditors. Outside of the U.S., similar insolvency work is primarily outsourced to third parties.
Insolvency accounts in the U.S. are typically those filed under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, have an associated payment plan that generally ranges from three to five years in duration, and can be acquired at any stage in the bankruptcy plan life cycle. Portfolios sold close to the filing of the bankruptcy plan will generally take months to generate cash flow; however, aged portfolios sold years after the filing of the bankruptcy plan will typically generate cash flows immediately. Non-U.S. insolvency accounts may have some slight differences, but generally operate in a similar manner. In Canada, we purchase Consumer Proposal, Consumer Credit Counseling and Bankrupt Accounts. In the UK, we purchase Individual Voluntary Arrangements, Company Voluntary Arrangements, Trust Deeds and Bankrupt Accounts. In Germany, we acquire consumer bankruptcies, which may also consist of small business loans with a personal guarantee.
Fee-Based Services
In addition to the purchase, collection and management of portfolios of nonperforming loans, we provide fee-based services including class action claims recovery purchasing and servicing through Claims Compensation Bureau, LLC ("CCB") and third-party servicing of bankruptcy accounts in the U.S.

Seasonality
Cash collections in the Americas tend to be higher in the first quarter of the year due to the high volume of income tax refunds received by individuals in the U.S., and trend lower as the year progresses. Customer payment patterns in all of the countries in which we operate can be affected by seasonal employment trends, income tax refunds and holiday spending habits geographically.
Competition
Purchased portfolio competition is derived from both third-party contingent fee collection agencies and other purchasers of debt that manage their own nonperforming loans or outsource such servicing. Our primary competitors in our fee-based business are providers of outsourced receivables management services. Regulatory complexity and burdens, combined with seller preference for experienced portfolio purchasers, create significant barriers to successful entry for new competitors particularly in the U.S. While both markets remain competitive, the contingent fee industry is more fragmented than the purchased portfolio industry.
We face bidding competition in our acquisition of nonperforming loans and in obtaining placements for our fee-based businesses. We also compete on the basis of reputation, industry experience and performance. We believe that our competitive strengths include our disciplined and proprietary underwriting process, the extensive data set we have developed since our founding in 1996, our ability to bid on portfolios at appropriate prices, our reputation from previous portfolio purchase transactions, our ability to close transactions in a timely fashion, our strong relationships with credit grantors, our team of well-trained collectors who provide quality customer service while complying with applicable collection laws, and our ability to efficiently and effectively collect on various asset types.
Compliance
Our approach to compliance is multifaceted and comprehensive and is overseen by both the Board of Directors and management. Our compliance management system includes policies and procedures, training, monitoring and consumer complaint response. In addition, our compliance expectations extend to our service providers. Our compliance management system is predicated on the following:

• | our Code of Conduct, which applies to all directors, officers and employees, is available at the Investor Relations page of our website at www.pragroup.com;


• | compliance and ethics training for our directors, officers and employees;


• | a confidential telephone and email hotline and web-based portals to report suspected compliance violations, fraud, financial reporting, accounting, and auditing matters and other acts that may be illegal and/or unethical;


• | regular testing by our compliance and internal audit departments of controls embedded in business processes designed to foster compliance with laws, regulations and internal policy; and


• | regular evaluation of the legislative and regulatory environment and monitoring of statutory and regulatory changes and relevant case law, so that operations personnel are aware of and in compliance with the laws and judicial decisions that may impact their job duties.

Regulation
We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local, and foreign laws that establish specific guidelines and procedures that debt collectors must follow when collecting customer accounts, including laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information. It is our policy to comply with the provisions of all applicable federal, state, local and foreign laws in all our activities even though there are frequent changes in these laws and regulations, including their interpretation, application and inconsistencies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Our failure to comply with these laws could result in enforcement action against us, the payment of significant fines and penalties, restrictions upon our operations or our inability to recover amounts owed to us. Significant laws and regulations applicable to our business include the following:

• | Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ("FDCPA"), which imposes certain obligations and restrictions on the practices of debt collectors, including specific restrictions regarding the time, place and manner of the communications.


• | Fair Credit Reporting Act ("FCRA"), which obligates credit information providers to verify the accuracy of information provided to credit reporting agencies and investigate consumer disputes concerning the accuracy of such information.

• | Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which requires that certain financial institutions, including collection agencies, develop policies to protect the privacy of consumers' private financial information and provide notices to consumers advising them of their privacy policies.


• | Electronic Funds Transfer Act, which regulates electronic fund transfer transactions, including a consumer’s right to stop payments on a pre-approved fund transfer and right to receive certain documentation of the transaction.


• | Telephone Consumer Protection Act ("TCPA"), which, along with similar state laws, places certain restrictions on users of certain automated dialing equipment and pre-recorded messages that place telephone calls to consumers.


• | Servicemembers Civil Relief Act ("SCRA"), which gives U.S. military service personnel relief from credit obligations they may have incurred prior to entering military service and may also apply in certain circumstances to obligations and liabilities incurred by a servicemember while serving on active duty.


• | Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which provides standards to protect the confidentiality of patients' personal healthcare and financial information in the U.S.


• | U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which prohibits certain contacts with consumers after the filing of bankruptcy petitions and dictates what types of claims will or will not be allowed in a bankruptcy proceeding including how such claims may be discharged.


• | Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires that telecommunications companies operating in the U.S. take steps to ensure functionally equivalent services are available for their consumers with disabilities, and requires accommodation of consumers with disabilities, such as the implementation of telecommunications relay services.


• | U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), United Kingdom Bribery Act ("UK Bribery Act") and Other Applicable Legislation. Our operations outside the U.S. are subject to the FCPA, which prohibits U.S. companies and their agents and employees from providing anything of value to a foreign official for the purposes of influencing any act or decision of these individuals in order to obtain an unfair advantage or help obtain or retain business. Although similar to the FCPA, the UK Bribery Act is broader in scope and covers bribes given to or received by any person with improper intent.


• | Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act"), which restructured the regulation and supervision of the financial services industry in the U.S. and created the CFPB. The CFPB has rulemaking, supervisory, and enforcement authority over larger consumer debt collectors. The Dodd-Frank Act, along with the Unfair, Deceptive, or Abusive Acts or Practices ("UDAAP") provisions included therein, and the Federal Trade Commission Act, prohibit unfair, deceptive, and/or abusive acts and practices. 


• | Foreign data protection and privacy laws, which include relevant country specific legislation in the United Kingdom and other European countries where we operate that regulate the processing of information relating to individuals, including the obtaining, holding, use or disclosure of such information; the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, which aims to protect personal information that is collected, used or disclosed in certain circumstances for purposes of electronic commerce in Canada; and the EU Data Protection Directive, which has been replaced by the General Data Protection Regulation, effective as of May 25, 2018, which regulates the processing and free movement of personal data within the EU and transfer of such data outside the EU.


• | Consumer Credit Act 1974 (and its related regulations), Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations of 1999 and the Financial Conduct Authority's consumer credit conduct of business rules, which apply to our international operations and govern consumer credit agreements.

In addition, certain of our EU subsidiaries are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity requirements.
On September 9, 2015, Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC ("PRA"), our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a consent order with the CFPB, settling a previously disclosed investigation of certain debt collection practices of PRA (the "Consent Order"). PRA entered into the Consent Order for settlement purposes, without admitting the truth of the allegations, other than the jurisdictional facts. Among other things, the Consent Order required PRA to: (i) vacate 837 judgments obtained after the applicable statute of limitations, refund $860,607 in payments received on account of such judgments and waive the remaining $3.4 million in judgment balances; (ii) refund $18.2 million in Litigation Department Calls Restitution, as defined in the Consent Order; and (iii) pay an $8.0 million civil money penalty to the CFPB.
