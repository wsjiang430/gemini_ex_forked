Item 1.          Description of Business.
 
The use of the words “CVD,” “we,” “us” or “our” refers to CVD Equipment Corporation, a New York corporation incorporated on October 13, 1982, and its wholly owned subsidiaries, CVD Materials Corporation (including its wholly owned subsidiaries CVD Tantaline ApS, and CVD MesoScribe Technologies Corporation) collectively “CVD Materials”), FAE Holdings 411519R LLC and 555 N Research Corporation except where the context otherwise requires.
 
We design, develop and manufacture a broad range of chemical vapor deposition, gas control and other state-of-the-art equipment and process solutions used to develop and manufacture materials and coatings for research and industrial applications. This equipment is used by our customers to research, design, and manufacture these materials or coatings for aerospace engine components, medical implants, semiconductors, solar cells, smart glass, carbon nanotubes, nanowires, LEDs, MEMS and other applications. Through CVD Materials and our Application Laboratory, we develop new material systems, provide material coating services, process development support and process startup assistance with the focus on enabling tomorrow’s technologiesTM.
 
Based on more than 36 years of experience, we use our capabilities in engineering, manufacturing and process development to transform new applications into leading-edge manufacturing solutions.

This enables university, research and industrial scientists at the cutting edge of technology to develop next generation aerospace, medical, nano, LEDs, semiconductors and other electronic components. We develop, manufacture and provide equipment for research and production based on our proprietary designs. We have built a significant library of design expertise, know-how and innovative solutions to assist our customers in developing these intricate processes and to accelerate their commercialization. This library of solutions, along with our vertically integrated manufacturing facilities, allows us to provide superior design, process and manufacturing solutions to our customers on a cost-effective basis.
 
Our strategy is to target opportunities in the research, development and production equipment market, with a focus on higher-growth applications such as aerospace, medical, smart glass, carbon nanotubes, nanowires, graphene, MEMS and LEDs. To expand our penetration into these growth markets, we have developed a line of proprietary standard products and custom systems. Historically, we manufactured products for research and development on a custom one-at-a-time basis to meet an individual customer’s specific research requirements. Our proprietary systems leverage the technological expertise that we have developed through designing these custom systems onto a standardized basic core. This core is easily adapted through a broad array of available options to meet the diverse product and budgetary requirements of the research community. By manufacturing the basic core of these systems in higher volumes, we are able to reduce both the cost and delivery time for our systems. These systems, which we market and sell under the EasyTube® and CVD product lines, are sold to researchers at universities, research laboratories, and startup companies in the United States and throughout the world.
 
Sales of our proprietary standard, custom systems and process solutions have been driven by our installed customer base, which includes several Fortune 500 companies. The strong performance and success of our products has historically driven repeat orders from existing customers as well as business from new customers. However, with our proprietary solutions and expanded focus on “accelerating the commercialization of tomorrow’s technologies”TM we have been developing a new customer base in addition to growing with our existing customers. We have generally gained new customers through word of mouth, limited print advertising and trade show attendance. We are now also gaining new customers by their awareness of our company in the marketplace with results from our Application Laboratory, relationships with startup companies, increased participation in trade shows and expanded internet advertising.
 
The core competencies we have developed in equipment and software design, as well as in systems manufacturing and process solutions, are used to engineer our finished products and to accelerate the commercialization path of our customer base. Our proprietary-real-time, software allows for rapid configuration, and provides our customers with powerful tools to understand, optimize and repeatedly control their processes. Our vertically integrated structure allows us to control the manufacturing process, from bringing raw metal and components into our manufacturing facilities to shipping out finished products. These factors significantly reduce cost, improve quality and reduce the time it takes from customer order to shipment of our products. Our Application Laboratory allows selected customers to bring up their process tools in our Application Laboratory and to work together with our scientists and engineers to optimize process performance.

Business Developments
 
CVD Materials Segment:
 
On October 31, 2017, through our newly formed and wholly-owned subsidiary, CVD MesoScribe Technologies Corporation (“CVD MesoScribe Technologies”), we acquired substantially all of the operating assets and business of MesoScribe Technologies, Inc. (“MTI”). Formed in 2002, by a group from Stony Brook University, MTI established itself as a pioneer and leader in the direct deposition of thermal sensors, heaters, and instrumentation for harsh environments.
 
MTI specialized in materials processing using Direct Write MesoPlasma™ printing technology. This technology is an enabling additive manufacturing process whereby materials are printed onto conformal components in precise patterns. MTI has provided MesoPlasma™ printing services and products to its customers for use in aerospace, power generation, satellite, and defense markets, focusing on developing and manufacturing innovative products for advanced sensing, heating, and communication.
 
This acquisition provides CVD access to additional materials deposition technology, a presence in new markets, a broader presence in aviation and defense markets and additional end user applications. In addition, the proprietary MesoPlasma™ technology complements our Tantaline® business which we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2016. The two technologies when combined provide a treatment and coating which can provide both corrosion and wear resistance. This is consistent with our strategic plan to leverage our equipment know-how, business infrastructure and proven ability to scale up new technologies, all offering high value-added materials, products, and services and is another step in our combined organic and acquisition growth strategy.
 
To support the expected growth of CVD Materials and to relocate the California MesoScribe operations as well as Tantaline USA business on November 30, 2017, we purchased the premises located at 555 North Research Place, Central Islip, NY (the “Premises”). The purchase price of the building was $13,850,000, exclusive of closing costs. On November 30, 2017, the Company’s newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary, 555 N Research Corporation (the “Assignee”) and the Islip IDA, entered into a Fee and Leasehold Mortgage and Security Agreement (the “Loan”) with HSBC Bank USA, N.A. (the “Bank”) in the amount of $10,387,500, which was used to finance a portion of the purchase price to acquire the Premises. The Loan was evidenced by the certain Note, dated November 30, 2017 (the “Note”), by and between Assignee and the Bank, and secured by a certain Fee and Leasehold Mortgage and Security Agreement, dated November 30, 2017 (the “Mortgage”), as well as a collateral Assignment of Leases and Rents (“Assignment of Leases”).
 
The Loan is payable in sixty consecutive equal monthly installments of $62,481, including interest. The Loan bears interest for each Interest Period (as defined in the Note), at the fixed rate of 3.9148%. The maturity date for the Note is December 1, 2022.
 
As a condition of the Bank making the Loan, the Company was required to guaranty Assignee’s obligations under the Loan pursuant to that certain Unlimited Guaranty, dated November 30, 2017 (the “Guaranty”).

With the completed purchase of the additional facility, we now have the manufacturing space to accelerate our capabilities of providing materials, coatings and surface treatments to meet our customers’ needs. We have now positioned ourselves for the expansion of our carbon composites and electronic materials, Tantaline® and MesoScribe Technologies product lines. Our expectation is to have operations for Tantaline® and MesoScribe commencing in the second or third quarter of 2019.
 
It is common and required to have coating services located near or at least in the country or territory of the customers being service. With regard to Tantaline® our Demark facility provides both local and global deposition services. The majority of the business though has been in Europe. The Central Islip, NY facility will primarily support the US customer base as well as serve as our application and technology center. This is an essential element of our growth strategy for Tantaline®. With respect to CVD MesoScribe Technologies group, we are in the process of consolidating the manufacturing and development operations in Central Islip by mid 2019. This will result in a reduction of our operating expenses associated with our leased space in California and will further provide synergy with the Central Islip sales and marketing functions and place the operations near the local Thermal Spray Center of Excellence located at Stony Brook University.

MesoScribe Technologies provides MesoPlasma™ printing services and products (heaters, antennas, & sensors) to aerospace, satellite, power generation, defense, and other markets requiring high performance. MesoScribe Technologies operated from a 22,000 square foot facility located in Huntington Beach, CA, which is relocating to Central Islip, New York by 2019, with sales and marketing support from our main facility in Central Islip, New York.
 
Carbon Composites
Our applications for the Carbon composite business come from achievements in our applications laboratory. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we announced the development of a family of advanced Fluid Reactors based on our innovations in nanotechnology and chemical vapor deposition technology. The Fluid Reactor is enabled by a novel reactor core element which allows the efficient transfer of gases into and out of liquids. The market adoption of this technology could supplant existing hollow fiber membrane technology for applications including filtration and liquid gasification or degasification. One such application is blood oxygenation cartridges, known as Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenators, which are typically used during cardio pulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery and are essential for life support. CVD has a patent pending embodying this technology. While holding promise the technology is in the evaluation phase and is not expected to generate revenue in near future.
 
The applications lab along with the sales and marketing team are exploring other possible Carbon based products that can be made from this technology.
 
Principal Equipment Products
 
Chemical Vapor Deposition - A process which passes a gaseous compound over a target material surface that is heated to such a degree that the compound decomposes and deposits a desired layer onto substrate material. The process is accomplished by combining appropriate gases in a reaction chamber, of the kind produced by the Company, at elevated temperatures (typically 150-1,600° Celsius). Our chemical vapor deposition systems are complete and include all necessary instrumentation, subsystems and components and include state-of-the-art process control software. We provide both standard and specifically engineered products for particular customer applications. Some of the standard systems we offer are for silicon, silicon-germanium, silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, polysilicon, liquid phase epitaxial, metalorganic chemical vapor deposition, carbon nanotubes, graphene nanowires, solar cell research and solar material quality control.
Chemical Vapor Deposition Systems - Used in a variety of models for laboratory research and production. All models are offered with total system automation, a microprocessor control system by which the user can measure, predict and regulate gas flow, temperature, pressure and chemical reaction rates, thus controlling the process in order to enhance the quality of the materials produced.

Markets and Marketing
 
We serve multiple global markets including aerospace, defense, biomedical implants, microelectronic and micromechanical devices, semiconductor, universities and research centers. Due to the highly technical nature of our products, we believe it is essential to contact customers directly through our sales personnel and through a network of domestic and international independent sales representatives and distributors specializing in the type of equipment, products and services that we sell. In addition to our traditional customer base, we are now accessing new markets and new customers through Tantaline,® MesoScribe,® and other components of our expanding materials business. Our primary marketing activities include direct sales contacts, participation in trade shows and our internet websites www.cvdequipment.com, cvdmaterialscorporation.com, www.stainlessdesign.com, www.firstnano.com, tantaline.com and www.mesoscribe.com. We are also focusing our efforts on being in the top listings on many search engines in order to increase the number of “hits” to our websites.
Customers
 
We continue to work on expanding our product and service offerings. Our systems and products are used in research and in production applications. We market and sell primarily to electronic component manufacturers, institutions involved in electronic component research (such as universities, government and industrial laboratories) and to industries such as aerospace and medical that require specialized coatings. We have both a domestic and international customer base with hundreds of installed systems.
 
Given the complexity of some of the systems we sell, revenue from a single customer in any one year can exceed 10.0% of our total sales. In fiscal years 2018 and 2017 one customer represented 38.2% and 66.1% of our annual revenues respectively. The loss of such a key customer, if not replaced by others with a similar amount of revenue, may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
 
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, approximately $2.4 million or 9.9% of our revenues were generated by sales to customers outside the U.S., compared to approximately $3.9 million or 9.6% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.
 
Warranties
 
Warranties on our equipment are typically for twelve months but can range up to twenty-four months from shipment with extended contracts. We furnish any warranties from original manufacturers of components used in our products. We provide service and support for our installed base of equipment with in-house field service personnel. Warranty costs, including those incurred in fiscal years 2018 and 2017, have been historically insignificant and expensed as incurred.

Competition
 
We can experience intense direct competition from both domestic and international competitors in all of our equipment segments. Our MesoScribe operations, which is in the adoption phase, faces barriers from established indirect competitors of existing solution providers. We are aware of other competitors that offer a substantial number of products and services comparable to ours. Many of our competitors (including customers who may elect to manufacture systems for internal use) have financial, marketing and other resources greater than ours. To date, we believe that each of our product and service segments has been able to compete favorably in markets that include these competitors, primarily on the basis of know-how, technical performance, quality, delivery, price and aftermarket support.
 
CVD/First Nano competes with companies located in Asia, Europe and the US in the research market. These companies have limited support and safety and system design capabilities. For the academia market, we also compete with laboratory built systems. Our equipment for production applications competes with in-house design and engineering capability and the capacity to build their own equipment internally. Additionally, there are large, established companies who compete with us and pose a competitive risk in the market. Due to budgetary and funding constraints, many customers are price sensitive. We believe that our systems are among the most advanced available for the targeted market. and coupled with our vertical integration in engineering and manufacturing, we can be very competitive.
 
SDC’s gas management and chemical delivery control systems are among the most advanced available. We further believe that SDC is differentiated from our competitors through our intimate understanding of how the systems in which our products are incorporated are actually used in field applications. We have gained this understanding as a result of having designed and built complex process gas systems for CVD/First Nano as well as for a number of the world’s leading semiconductor, aerospace, medical, solar manufacturers, research laboratories and universities.
 
Sources of Supply
 
Many of the components used in producing our products are purchased from unrelated suppliers. We have OEM status with our suppliers but we are not obligated to purchase a pre-determined quantity. We are not dependent on a principal or major supplier and alternate suppliers are available. Subject to lead times, the components and raw materials we use in manufacturing our products are readily obtainable.
 
We maintain a fully-equipped machine shop that we use to fabricate a significant portion of our metal components in-house, including the most complex designed parts of our equipment. The investment in our machine shop has significantly helped in increasing our efficiencies while significantly reducing labor costs and time in production. Similarly, our quartz fabrication capability is sufficient to meet our quartz-ware needs.
 
Materials procured from the outside and/or manufactured internally undergo a rigorous quality control process to ensure that the parts meet or exceed our requirements and those of our customers. Upon final assembly, all equipment undergoes a final series of complete testing to ensure maximum product performance.

Backlog 
 
As of December 31, 2018, our order backlog was approximately $3 million and, since that time, we have received additional orders in excess of $6 million. Although our overall backlog is lower than our historical high, we continue to work at diversifying our customer base away from any one customer as we focus on new opportunities with new and existing customers within our existing marketplaces and in new applications, including the start-up of the CVD Materials operations expected in the second or third quarter of 2019. The timing for completion of backlog varies depending on the product mix and can be as long as two years. Order backlog is usually a reasonable management tool to indicate expected revenues, however, it does not provide an assurance of future achievement or profits as order cancellations or delays are possible.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our success is dependent, in part upon our proprietary technology and other proprietary rights. We have historically protected our proprietary information and intellectual property such as design specifications, blueprints, technical processes and employee know-how through the use of non-disclosure agreements.  In addition, where we deem appropriate, we have, and will continue to file for patent protection of our proprietary technology that we believe has the potential to be incorporated into our products and sold to multiple customers.  We also maintain and/or assert rights in certain trademarks relating to certain of our products and product lines, and claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we announced the development of a family of advanced Fluid Reactors based on our innovations in nanotechnology and chemical vapor deposition technology. The Fluid Reactor is enabled by a novel reactor core element which allows the efficient transfer of gases into and out of liquids. The market adoption of this technology could supplant existing hollow fiber membrane technology for applications including filtration and liquid gasification or degasification. One such application is blood oxygenation cartridges, known as Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenators, which are typically used during cardio pulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery and are essential for life support. CVD has a patent pending embodying this technology.
 
In addition to the above, we continue to develop new Tantalum processes under our Tantaline line to improve the corrosion resistance of additional base material such as Nickel-based alloys. In 2018, we announced that two patents applications were filed.
 
While patent, copyright and trademark protections for our intellectual property are important to different degrees for our various products and solutions, we believe our future success in highly dynamic markets is most dependent upon the technical competence and creative skills of our personnel and our ability to accelerate the commercialization of next generation intellectual properties. We attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through non-disclosure agreements with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants and other security measures.

Research and Development
 
The university research community is at the forefront of nanotechnology research, and we are focused on providing state-of-the-art systems to this market that will help bridge the gap between pioneering research and marketable products. Our Application Laboratory, together with a number of leading universities and startup companies with whom we partner from time to time, conducts cutting-edge research on the growth and infiltration of carbon nanotubes, graphene and nanowires as well as on selected aerospace manufacturing processes. The results of this research could have far reaching implications concerning the use and manufacture of carbon nanotubes, graphene, nanowires and aerospace coatings for many markets. Our intention is that together with leading edge universities and start-up companies and major aerospace/defense companies, we will leverage our collective expertise in this field, which will allow us to capitalize on commercial opportunities in the future.
 
In 2018, we incurred approximately $607,000 in research and development expenses as compared to $437,000 in 2017.
 
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local government regulations, such as environmental, labor and export control. We believe that we have obtained all necessary permits to operate our business and that we are in material compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to us.
Insurance
 
Our products are used in our customers’ manufacturing processes which in some cases contain explosive, flammable, corrosive and toxic gases. There are potential exposures to personal injury as well as property damage, particularly if operated without regard to the design limits of the systems and components. Additionally, the end products of some of our customers are used in areas such as aerospace and high-tech devices where safety is of great concern. Management reviews its insurance coverage on an annual basis or more frequently if appropriate and we believe we have the types and amounts of insurance coverage that are sufficient for our business.
Employees
 
At December 31, 2018, we had 197 employees. We had 96 employees in manufacturing, 44 in engineering (including research and development and efforts related to product improvement) 9 in field service, 16 in sales and marketing and 32 in general management, maintenance and administration, compared to 231 employees as of December 31, 2017.
