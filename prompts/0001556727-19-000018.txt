Our business plan includes the intent to extend our operations throughout the Puget Sound Region. This region dominates the economy of the Pacific Northwest and is broadly defined as the area surrounding the inlet of the Pacific Ocean that extends into the northwestern section of the state of Washington. The population of this additional region (beyond our current market area) is approximately 2.2 million, or 29.7% of the state's population. The market area is a mix of urban, suburban and rural areas, with the Seattle metropolitan area harboring a well-developed urban area along the eastern portion of Puget Sound. The region extends from Whatcom County in the north on the Canadian border to Thurston and Pierce counties to the south. Other key metropolitan areas within the Puget Sound region include Bellingham (Whatcom County), Burlington (Skagit County), Everett (Snohomish County), Tacoma (Pierce County) and Olympia (Thurston County).
Key employment sectors include aerospace, military, information technology, clean technology, biotechnology, education, logistics, international trade, and tourism. The region is well known for the long-term presence of The Boeing Corporation and Microsoft, two major industry leaders. The military presence includes a number of large installations serving the U.S. Air Force, Army and Navy. Given the employment profile, the region's workforce is generally highly educated. Washington's geographic proximity to the Pacific Rim along with a deep water port has made it a center for international trade, which contributes significantly to the regional economy. The Washington ports make Washington the fourth largest exporting state in the nation, and the top five trading partners with Washington include China, Mexico, Canada, Japan and Korea. Tourism has also developed into a major industry for the area, due to the scenic beauty, temperate climate, and easy accessibility. Maritime industry employment, supported by the trade and fishing industries, is also an important employment sector.

One- to Four-Family Real Estate Lending. At December 31, 2018, one- to four-family residential mortgage loans (excluding loans held for sale) totaled $336.2 million, or 38.7%, of our total loan portfolio, including $34.3 million, or 10.2%, of loans secured by properties outside the state of Washington, primarily in the states of California and Ohio. We originate both fixed and adjustable-rate residential loans, which can be sold in the secondary market or retained in our portfolio, and supplement originations with loan purchases from time to time, depending on our balance sheet objectives. Residential loans are underwritten to either secondary market standards for sale or to internal underwriting standards, which may not meet Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac") and Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae") eligibility requirements.
Fixed-rate residential mortgages are offered with repayment terms between 10 and 30 years, priced off of Freddie Mac posted daily pricing indications adjusted for economic and competitive considerations. Adjustable-rate residential mortgage products with similar amortization terms are also offered, with an interest rate that is typically fixed for an initial period ranging from 1 to 7 years with annual adjustments thereafter. Future interest rate adjustments include periodic caps of no more than 2% and lifetime caps of 5% to 6% above the initial interest rate, with no borrower prepayment restrictions.
Adjustable-rate mortgage loans could increase credit risk when interest rates rise. An increase to the borrower's loan payment may affect the borrower's ability to repay and could increase the probability of default. To mitigate this risk to both the borrower and First Federal, adjustable rate loans contain both periodic and lifetime interest rate caps, limiting the amount of payment changes. In addition, depending on market conditions, we may underwrite the borrower at a higher interest rate and payment amount than the initial rate. We do not offer adjustable-rate mortgages with deep discount teaser rates. At December 31, 2018, the average interest rate on our adjustable-rate mortgage loans was approximately 31.7% under the fully indexed rate. As of December 31, 2018, we had $121.8 million, or 14.0%, of adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans in our residential loan portfolio. 
The underwriting process considers a variety of factors including credit history, debt to income ratios, property type, loan to value ratio, and occupancy. For loans with over 80% loan to value ratios, we typically require private mortgage insurance, which reduces our exposure to loss in the event of a loan default. Credit risk is also mitigated by obtaining title insurance, hazard insurance, and flood insurance. Residential mortgage loans which require appraisals are appraised by independent fee appraisers.
In connection with rules and regulations issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB"), defining qualified mortgage loans based on the borrower’s ability to repay the loan, we believe that generally all of our mortgage loans originated meet this standard.
First Federal does not actively engage in subprime mortgage lending, either through advertising, marketing, underwriting and/or risk selection, and has no established program to originate or purchase subprime mortgage loans.
Commercial and Multi-Family Real Estate Lending. At December 31, 2018, $253.2 million, or 29.1%, and $82.3 million, or 9.5%, of our total loan portfolio was secured by commercial and multi-family real estate property, respectively. At December 31, 2018, we have identified $37.9 million of our commercial real estate portfolio as owner-occupied commercial real estate and $297.7 million is secured by income producing, or non-owner-occupied, commercial real estate. Substantially all of our commercial real estate and multi-family loans are secured by properties located in Washington State.
These loans are generally priced at a higher rate of interest than one- to four-family residential loans, to compensate for the greater risk associated with higher loan balances and the complexity of underwriting and monitoring. Repayment on loans secured by commercial or multi-family properties is dependent on successful management by the property owner to create sufficient net operating income to meet debt service requirements. Changes in economic and real estate market conditions can affect net operating income, capitalization rates, and ultimately the valuation and marketability of the collateral. As a result, we analyze market data including vacancy rates, absorption percentages, leasing rates, and competing projects under development. Interest rate, occupancy and capitalization rate stress testing are required as part of our underwriting analysis. If the borrower is a corporation, we generally require and obtain personal guarantees from the corporate principals, which include underwriting of their personal financial statements, tax returns, cash flows and individual credit reports, which provides us with additional support and a secondary source for repayment of the debt. 
We offer both fixed- and adjustable-rate loans on commercial and multi-family real estate, which may include balloon payments. As of December 31, 2018, we had $177.6 million in adjustable-rate commercial real 
13

estate loans and $61.6 million in adjustable-rate multi-family loans. Commercial and multi-family real estate loans with adjustable rates generally adjust after an initial period of three to five years and have maturity dates of three to ten years. Amortization terms are generally limited to terms up to 25 years on commercial real estate loans and up to 30 years on multi-family loans. Adjustable-rate multi-family residential and commercial real estate loans are generally priced to market indices with appropriate margins, which may include the U.S. Constant Maturity Treasury Rate, London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), The Wall Street Journal prime rate, or other acceptable index. Substantially all adjustable-rate commercial and multi-family real estate loans are subject to a floor rate, and the weighted average floor rate on these loans was 4.33% at December 31, 2018. Of all of the adjustable-rate commercial loans, 44.9% are subject to a ceiling rate, and the weighted average ceiling rate on those loans was 10.2% at December 31, 2018.
The maximum loan to value ratio for commercial and multi-family real estate loans is typically limited to 75% of the appraiser opinion of market value. The minimum debt service coverage ratio is 1.20x for non-owner-occupied and owner-occupied properties. We require independent appraisals or evaluations on all loans secured by commercial real estate from an approved appraisers list.
We require most of our commercial and multi-family real estate loan borrowers to submit annual financial statements and/or rent rolls on the subject property, as well as personal financial statements of borrowers and guarantors. These properties may also be subject to annual inspections to support that the appropriate maintenance is being performed by the owner/borrower. All commercial real estate loans over $1.0 million are reviewed at least annually. The loan and its borrowers and/or guarantors are subject to an annual risk certification verifying that the loan is properly risk rated based upon covenant compliance and other terms as provided for in the loan agreements. While this process does not prevent loans from becoming delinquent, it does provide us with the opportunity to better identify problem loans in a timely manner and to work with the borrower prior to the loan becoming delinquent.

If we foreclose on a multi-family or commercial real estate loan, the marketing and liquidation period can be a lengthy process with substantial holding costs. Vacancies, deferred maintenance, repairs and market stigma can result in real or perceived losses for the time it takes to return the property to profitability. Depending on the individual circumstances, initial charge-offs and subsequent losses on commercial real estate loans can be unpredictable and substantial.
The average outstanding loan size in our commercial real estate portfolio, including multi-family loans, was $1.7 million as of December 31, 2018. We generally target individual commercial and multi-family real estate loans between $1.0 million and $5.0 million to small and mid-size owners and investors in our market areas as well as other parts of Washington. We will also make commercial and multi-family real estate loans in other states if we have a pre-existing relationship with the borrower.
Our three largest commercial and multi-family borrowing relationships, including loan balances outstanding and unused commitments, at December 31, 2018 consisted of an $18.5 million relationship secured by multi-family construction in King County, a $15.9 million relationship secured by multi-family real estate and multi-family construction in Pierce and King counties, and a $14.9 million relationship secured by multi-family construction and multi-family real estate in Kitsap and King counties.
Construction and Land Lending. Our construction and land loans decreased $17.0 million, or 23.9%, to $54.1 million, or 6.2% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2018 compared to $71.1 million at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2018, the undisbursed portion of construction loans in process totaled $57.0 million compared to $59.4 million at December 31, 2017.
First Federal offers an “all-in-one” residential custom construction loan product, which upon completion of construction will be held in our loan portfolio. We also originate construction loans for certain commercial real estate projects. These projects include, but are not limited to, subdivisions, multi-family, retail, office/warehouse, hotel, and office buildings. Underwriting criteria on these loans include, but are not limited to, minimum debt service coverage requirements of 1.20 or better, loan to value limitations, pre-leasing requirements, construction cost over-run contingency reserves, interest and absorption period reserves, occupancy, capitalization rates and interest rate stress testing, as well as other underwriting criteria.
Construction loan applications generally require architectural and working plans, a material specifications list, a detailed cost breakdown and a construction contract. Construction loan advances are based on progress payments for “work in place” based on detailed line item construction budgets. Independent construction inspectors are used to evaluate the construction draw request relative to the progress and “work in place.” Our construction administrator reviews all construction projects, inspection reports and construction loan advance requests to ensure they are appropriate and in compliance with all loan conditions. Other risk management tools include title insurance, date down endorsements or periodic lien inspections prior to the payment of construction loan advances. In some cases, general contractors may be required to provide sub-contractor lien releases for any work performed prior to the filing of our deed of trust or prior to each construction loan advance.
Custom and speculative construction valuations are based on the assumption that the project will be built in accordance with plans and specifications submitted to us at the time of the loan application. The appraiser takes into consideration the proposed design and market appeal of the improvements, based on current market conditions and demand for homes, although the improvements may not be completed for six to twelve months or longer, depending on the complexity of the plans and specifications and market conditions.
Land acquisition, development and construction loans are available to local contractors and developers for the purpose of holding and/or developing residential building sites and homes when market conditions warrant such activity. Land acquisition loans are secured by a first lien on the property and are generally limited to 65% of the acquisition price or the appraised value, whichever is less. Development land loans are generally limited to 75% of the discounted appraised value based on the projected lot sale absorption rate and associated carry and liquidation costs of the developed lots and homes. Underwriting criteria for acquisition and development loans include evidence of preliminary plat approval, compliance with state and Federal environmental protection and disclosure laws, engineering plans, detailed cost breakdowns and marketing plans. These loans have been limited to projects within the North Olympic Peninsula and Puget Sound region. Other risk management tools include title insurance, feasibility and market absorption reports.
The success of land acquisition, development and construction lending is dependent upon successful completion of the project and the sale or leasing of the property for repayment of the loan. Because of the 
16

uncertainties inherent in the estimates related to construction costs, the market value of the completed project, the demand for the property at completion, the rates of interest paid, and other factors, actual results may vary and can have a significant adverse impact on the value and marketability of the collateral.
At December 31, 2018, the average construction commitment for single-family residential construction was $424,000, for multi-family construction was $3.3 million and for commercial real estate construction was $4.3 million. The largest construction commitments for multi-family and commercial real estate were $9.4 million and $9.7 million, respectively, at December 31, 2018.
Substantially all of our land acquisition, development and construction lending have adjustable rates of interest based on The Wall Street Journal prime rate. During the term of construction, the accumulated interest on the loan is either added to the principal of the loan through an interest reserve or billed monthly, as is the case for acquisition and development loans. When original interest reserves set up at origination are exhausted, no additional reserves are permitted unless the loan is re-analyzed and it is determined that the additional reserves are appropriate.
Because an incomplete construction project is difficult to sell in the event of default, we may be required to advance additional funds and/or contract with another builder in order to complete construction. There is a risk that we may not fully recover unpaid loan funds and associated construction and liquidation costs under these circumstances. Speculative construction loans carry additional risk associated with identifying an end-purchaser for the finished project.
We also originate individual lot loans, which are secured by a first lien on the property, for borrowers who are planning to build on the lot within the next five years. Generally, these loans have a maximum loan to value ratio of 75% for improved lands (legal access, water and power) and 50% to 65% for unimproved land. The interest rate on these loans is fixed with a 20-year amortization and a five-year term.

Our construction and land loans are geographically disbursed throughout the state of Washington and, as a result, these loans are susceptible to risks that may be different depending on the location of the project. We manage all of our construction lending by utilizing a licensed third party vendor to assist us in monitoring our construction projects, with construction loan proceeds disbursed periodically as construction progresses and as inspections by our approved third party vendor warrant them.

Consumer Lending. We offer a variety of consumer loans, including home equity loans and lines of credit, new and used automobile loans, loans on other miscellaneous vehicles, and personal lines of credit. At December 31, 2018, home equity loans and lines of credit totaled $37.6 million, or 4.3% of the loan portfolio. Our interest rates on home equity loans are priced for risk based on credit score, loan to value and overall credit quality of the applicant. Home equity loans are made for, among other purposes, the improvement of residential properties and other consumer needs. Some of these loans are secured by first liens; however, the majority of these loans are secured by a second deed of trust on the residential property. Fixed-rate, fully-amortizing home equity loans in first lien position are available up to a maximum loan amount of $750,000 with repayment periods ranging from 5 to 20 years. We also offer, to borrowers who qualify, a five-year home equity line of credit with a discounted initial fixed interest rate for the first year with the interest rate adjusting monthly thereafter based on a margin over the prime rate; payments are interest-only for the first year. The balance and rate are fixed after five years and the principal amortized over the remaining fifteen year period of the loan up to a maximum of $750,000 if in first lien position. Home equity fixed and line of credit products in second lien positions behind a First Federal mortgage have a maximum loan amount of $250,000. Home equity loans and lines of credit have greater risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans because they are secured by mortgages subordinated to the existing first mortgage on the property, which we may or may not have private mortgage insurance coverage.
We originate, refinance, or purchase auto loans with a maximum term of up to 144 months depending on the age and condition of the vehicle and strength of the borrower. Loan rates for auto lending, as well as all other consumer loans, are priced based on the specific loan type and the risk involved. Direct and indirect lending sources are used to originate auto loans.
Indirect auto loans are originated with auto dealerships located throughout our market areas through a third party service provider that also facilitates a portion of the underwriting and origination of these loans based on our underwriting and pricing criteria. As of December 31, 2018, we worked with 44 auto dealerships within our market areas, which provides us with the opportunity to actively deepen customer relationships through cross-selling 
19

opportunities. At December 31, 2018, auto loans totaled $39.7 million, of which $36.0 million were originated through dealer programs. Indirect auto customers receive a fixed rate loan in an amount and at an interest rate that is based on their FICO credit score, age of the vehicle, and loan term. Our underwriting and pricing criteria for indirect auto loans focuses primarily on the ability of the borrower to repay the loan rather than the value of the underlying collateral. Loans may be made up to the full sales price of the vehicle plus "Additional Vehicle Costs" such as sales tax, dealer preparation fees, license fees and title fees, service and warranty contracts, and "GAP" insurance coverage obtained in connection with the vehicle. Accordingly, the amount financed by us may exceed the manufacturer's suggested retail price of the financed vehicle and the Additional Vehicle Costs. In the case of used vehicles, the amount financed may exceed the vehicle's value as assigned by the Kelly Blue Book, our primary reference source of used cars and the Additional Vehicle Costs. In January 2017, a "final LTV" was implemented, limiting the loan to value ratio to 100% of the full sales price plus Additional Vehicle Costs. The loan term averages 70 months, which is comparable to national auto industry data.
We purchase auto loans through a partnership with a loan originator that operates in all 50 states, underwriting and funding loans for classic (25 years or older) and collector (premium price with limited production) vehicles. These loans range from $10,000 to over $250,000 with terms that range from 84 to 144 months and require down payments of 10% to 20%. We receive loan pools each week with complete packages that we are able to underwrite to determine whether to purchase or pass on all loans submitted. These loans present unique risks with the collateral being located across the country; however, our loan originator helps mitigate risk of loss by facilitating collection efforts should repossession become necessary, for which we would incur a cost. Historically, losses on these types of loans is less than 1% and First Federal has incurred no losses since implementation of this program.
Because our primary focus for auto loans is on the credit quality of the customer rather than the value of the collateral, the collectability of an auto loan is more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances than a single-family first mortgage loan. We rely on the borrower's continuing financial stability, rather than on the value of the vehicle, for the repayment of an auto loan.
Consumer loans represent additional risks because of the mobility and rapidly depreciating nature of consumer assets in contrast to real estate based collateral. If a borrower defaults, repossession and liquidation of the collateral may not provide sufficient proceeds to satisfy the outstanding loan balance. Other factors that may account for potential loan losses on consumer loans include deferred maintenance and damages. While subsequent legal actions and judgments against borrowers in default may be appropriate, such collection efforts and costs may not always be warranted and are evaluated on a case by case basis. Consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability and federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, which may limit the amount that can be recovered on these loans.
Commercial Business Lending. As of December 31, 2018, commercial business loans totaled $18.9 million, or 2.2%, of our loan portfolio. These loans include lines of credit, term loans, and letters of credit used for general business purposes, including seasonal and permanent working capital, equipment financing, and general investments. In general, these loans are typically secured by business assets, and loan terms vary from one to seven years with floating rates indexed to LIBOR, The Wall Street Journal prime rate or other indices.
Commercial business loans typically have shorter maturity terms and higher interest spreads than real estate loans but generally involve more credit risk because of the type and nature of the collateral. We are focusing our efforts on small-to-medium sized, privately-held companies with local or regional businesses that operate in our market area. Our commercial business lending policy includes an analysis of the borrower’s financial condition, past, present and future cash flows, as well as the collateral pledged as security. We generally obtain personal guarantees on our commercial business loans.
Our commercial business loans are originated based on the cash flow of the borrowing entity, which may be unpredictable due to normal business cycles, industry changes, and economic and political conditions. Secondary and tertiary sources of repayment are guarantor cash flows and collateral liquidation. Most often, this collateral consists of real estate, accounts receivable, inventory, or equipment. Collateral may fluctuate in value, which can reduce liquidation proceeds, and our ability to collect on accounts receivable or other third party payments can affect the amount of losses we incur in the event of default.
Loan Origination and Underwriting. Our loans are obtained from a variety of sources, including existing or walk-in customers, business development, referrals, and advertising, among others. All of our consumer loan products, including residential mortgage loans and secured and unsecured consumer loans are processed through our centralized processing and underwriting center. Commercial business loans, including commercial and multi-family 
20

real estate loans, are originated by our relationship managers ("RMs") and underwritten centrally with formalized credit presentations submitted for approval to the appropriate individuals and committee(s) with lending authority designated by the Board of Directors.
Lending Authority. Through its current policy, the Board of Directors delegates lending authority to the Bank’s management and staff, to the Senior Loan Committee ("SLC") and to the Board of Directors' Loan and Asset Quality Committee ("BLC"). Overdrafts and small business express loans require one signature. The Chief Credit Officer ("CCO") has the authority to approve overdrafts up to $100,000, and certain other staff and management have authority to approve overdrafts ranging from $5,000 to $50,000. Our small business express loans, which are commercial business loans of $100,000 or less, are approved by the CCO or designated personnel and management. In addition, the CCO may approve Automated Clearing House and Remote Deposit Capture transactions in any amount, and has the authority to approve most modifications and extensions of credit in any amount, for terms of less than one year.
Mortgage loans require at least two signatures with cumulative approval authority up to the loan amount requested. Underwriters have approval authority of $424,100. The Consumer and Mortgage Manager and CCO have approval authority of $1.0 million. Mortgage loans over $2.0 million are approved by the SLC, and loans $6.0 million and over are approved by the BLC. 
Commercial loans require at least two signatures with cumulative approval authority up to the loan amount requested. The CCO has approval authority of $1.0 million, and other personnel have approval authority ranging from $250,000 to $500,000. Commercial loan relationships over $2.5 million are approved by the SLC, and loans over $8.0 million are approved by the BLC. The SLC has the authority to exceed the $8.0 million limitation when approving a new loan as part of an existing commercial relationship, not to exceed $750,000.
Consumer loans require at least two signatures with cumulative approval authority up to the loan amount requested. The Consumer and Mortgage Manager has approval authority for consumer loans of $250,000 and certain named individuals have authority ranging from $35,000 to $50,000. Additionally, we have assigned authority to approve indirect auto loans meeting our underwriting and pricing criteria to our third party service provider. Indirect auto loan reports are reviewed daily for adherence to our policies.
Monthly, the SLC and the BLC review loan portfolio quality, concentrations, production, and industry trends and provide directional oversight. On a quarterly basis, the BLC reviews the SLC approved loans, and the Board of Directors reviews the BLC approved loans, as well as policy exceptions, credit concentrations and related risk concerns. Additionally, all policies are reviewed no less than annually.
Washington law provides for loans to one borrower restrictions, which restricts total loans and extensions of credit by a bank to 20% of its unimpaired capital and surplus, which was $30.4 million at December 31, 2018. First Federal, however, restricts its loans to one borrower to no more than $18.0 million unless specifically approved by the BLC as an exception to policy. The following table provides a summary of our five largest relationships at December 31, 2018.

Loan Originations, Servicing, Purchases and Sales. We originate mortgage, consumer, multi-family and commercial real estate, and commercial business loans for our portfolio utilizing fixed- and adjustable-rate loan terms. We also purchase whole and participation loans on a servicing retained or released basis. During the year ended December 31, 2018, our total originations were $253.4 million. Our total originations for the six month transition period ended December 31, 2017 were $174.4 million and for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 were $221.9 million.
21

During the year ended December 31, 2018, we purchased $70.4 million of loans. We purchased $43.9 million of loans during the six month transition period ended December 31, 2017 and purchased $44.0 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. During the last year, the majority of loan pool purchases consisted of auto loans purchased through our partnership with an originator specializing in classic and collector vehicles followed by commercial real estate purchase and participations, whereby we receive a portion of a loan originated by another lender who retains the servicing and customer relationship of the loan and may, depending on the terms of the agreement, retain a portion of the interest as a servicing fee. Loan pools purchased prior to 2018 consisted mainly of loans exceeding conforming loan limits, or "jumbo loans," secured by single family residential properties located in the states of Washington and California. Purchased loans, loan pools, and participations are underwritten by our credit administration department and approved by the appropriate loan committee(s) prior to purchase, according to our lending authority guidelines. 
The North Olympic Peninsula region, which represents a substantial concentration of depositors and borrowers, has experienced limited population growth, and the region's unemployment rate is higher than both the state and national unemployment rates. As a result, we originate and purchase loans outside of these areas in the counties surrounding the Puget Sound and elsewhere, and we may purchase loans with different credit and underwriting criteria than those we originate organically.
We sell residential first mortgage loans in the secondary market. The majority of residential mortgages we originate are fixed-rate, which we may sell to the secondary market to manage our interest rate risk and improve noninterest income. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the six month transition period ended December 31, 2017 and the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, we sold $25.7 million, $17.4 million and $23.3 million of residential mortgage loans, respectively. Our secondary market relationship for residential loans is primarily with Freddie Mac, and more recently we have engaged with another third-party purchaser whereby we can sell these loans with servicing released and realize higher gains on sale than when we receive a servicing fee on loans sold when the servicing is retained by us. We expect to sell loans with servicing released to this third-party purchaser beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. Loans in general are sold on a non-recourse basis, whenever possible, subject to a provision for repurchase upon breach of representation, warranty or covenant.
At December 31, 2018, we were servicing $175.5 million of loans for others. We earned mortgage servicing income of $454,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018, $228,000 for the six month transition period ended December 31, 2017, and $464,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. Mortgage servicing rights for these loans had a fair value of $1.5 million at December 31, 2018. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," of this Form 10-K.
During fiscal 2008, we sold loans with “life of the loan” recourse provisions to Freddie Mac, and beginning in May 2013, Freddie Mac has required loans guaranteed by the United States Department of Agriculture to be sold with "life of the loan" recourse provisions as well. These recourse provisions require us to repurchase the loan upon default. The balance of loans serviced for others with life of the loan recourse provisions was $5.6 million at December 31, 2018. There were no loans repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2018 or during the six month transition period ended December 31, 2017, and one loan was repurchased during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 for $100,000.
We may solicit one or more financial institutions to take a portion of a commercial real estate loan in order to manage risk or generate income through gain on sale or servicing fees. The participation agreement outlines the indirect relationship between the Bank and the participant with regard to borrower access, loan servicing, loan documents, etc. The participant's transactional involvement is typically limited to only that provided by the Bank as “agent” in the transaction, and the participation interest is sold without recourse. We maintain greater than 50 percent ownership interest in the loan and retain the servicing of loans we participate with others in order to maintain our direct relationship with the borrower and better manage our credit risk. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold $3.9 million in commercial real estate loan participations, and during the six months ended December 31, 2017, we sold $1.5 million in commercial real estate loan participations.
Gains, losses and transfer fees on sales of one- to four-family and commercial real estate loans are recognized at the time of the sale. Our net gain on sale of residential and commercial real estate loans was $577,000, $499,000 and $757,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018, the six month transition period ended December 31, 2017, and the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, respectively.

Loan Origination and Other Fees. Loan origination fees paid by the borrower generally represent a percentage of the principal amount of the loan. Accounting standards require that certain fees received, net of certain origination costs, be deferred and amortized over the contractual life of the loan. Net deferred fees or costs associated with loans that are prepaid or sold are recognized as income or expense at the time of prepayment. We had $292,000, $724,000 and $904,000 of net deferred loan fees at December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, respectively. In addition, we receive fees for loan commitments, late payments and miscellaneous services.
Asset Quality
Management of asset quality includes loan performance monitoring and reporting as well as utilization of both internal and independent third party loan reviews. The primary objective of our loan review process is to 
23

measure borrower performance and assess risk for the purpose of identifying loan weakness in order to minimize loan loss exposure. From the time of origination through final repayment, all loans are assigned a risk rating based on pre-determined criteria. The risk rating is monitored annually for most loans, and may change during the life of the loan as appropriate.
Loan reviews vary by loan type and complexity of the loan. Some loans may warrant detailed individual review, while other loans may have less risk based upon size, or be of a homogeneous nature, such as consumer loans and loans secured by residential real estate. Homogeneous loans may be reviewed on the basis of risk indicators such as delinquency or credit rating. In cases of significant concern, re-evaluation of the loan and associated risks are documented by completing a loan risk assessment and action plan.
First lien residential mortgage loan payments have a 15-day grace period following the due date, after which time we institute collection procedures. Attempts to contact the borrower continue until the 90th day, after which time if we have not been able to reach a mutually satisfactory arrangement for curing the default, we will pursue all permissible remedies according to the terms of the security instruments and applicable law. In the event of an unsecured loan, we will either seek legal action against the borrower or refer the loan to an outside collection agency.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, the six month period ended December 31, 2017 and the year ended June 30, 2017, gross interest income which would have been recorded had the nonaccruing loans been current in accordance with their original terms amounted to $279,000, $277,000 and $261,000, respectively. The amount that was included in interest income on a cash basis on nonaccruing loans was $99,000, $12,000 and $13,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018, the six month period ended December 31, 2017, and the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, respectively.
Other Loans of Concern. In addition to the nonperforming assets set forth in the table above, as of December 31, 2018 there were 41 loans totaling $4.1 million that continue to accrue interest but for which management has elevated concerns about the ability of these borrowers to comply with their loan repayment terms that may result in disclosure of such loans as nonperforming in the future. These loans have been considered in management's determination of our allowance for loan losses.
Real Estate Owned and Repossessed Property. Real estate we acquire as a result of collection efforts is classified as real estate owned. These properties are recorded at the lower of its cost, which is the unpaid principal 
25

balance of the related loan, or the fair market value of the property less selling costs. Other repossessed property, including automobiles, are also recorded at the lower of cost or fair market value less selling costs. As of December 31, 2018, First Federal had no properties in real estate owned and five autos in repossessed personal property owned with a book value of $52,000. Real estate owned properties are listed with a real estate broker for sale, included in the multiple listing service, and actively marketed. 
Restructured Loans. According to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), we are required to account for certain loan modifications or restructurings as a TDR. In general, the modification or restructuring of a debt is considered a TDR if we, for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower’s financial difficulties, grant a concession to the borrower under more favorable terms and conditions than we would grant to an ordinary bank customer under the normal course of business. 
General loan restructures and modifications not considered as TDR loans may include lowering interest rates, extending the maturity date, deferring or re-amortizing monthly payments or other concessions. These general loan restructures and modifications are made on a case-by-case basis provided that such concessions are not below market rates nor considered material and outside of the terms and conditions granted to other borrowers under normal course of business standards. 
Adversely classified loans which are subsequently modified and placed in nonaccrual status must remain in nonaccrual status for a period of not less than six months with consecutive satisfactory payment performance and be further supported by current financial information and analysis which demonstrates the borrowers have the financial capacity to meet future debt service before being returned to accrual status. 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 33 loans with an aggregate principal balance of $3.7 million that were identified as TDR loans, of which $3.7 million were performing in accordance with their revised payment terms and on accrual status. As of December 31, 2018, there were $84,000 of TDR loans on nonaccrual and whose accrual status continues to be evaluated by management. Included in the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2018 was a reserve of $43,000 related to TDR loans. Nonaccruing TDR loans are classified as substandard, and accruing TDR loans may be classified at any level in our loan grading system depending upon verified repayment sources, collateral values and repayment history.
Classified Assets. Federal regulations provide for the classification of lower quality loans and other assets as substandard, doubtful or loss. An asset is considered substandard when material conditions are identified which raise issues about the financial capacity, collateral or other conditions which may compromise the borrower’s ability to satisfactorily perform under the terms of the loan. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make near term collection or liquidation highly questionable and improbable. Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible or of no material value. Assets that do not currently expose us to sufficient risk to warrant classification as substandard or doubtful but possess identified weaknesses are classified by us as either watch or special mention assets.
In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 310 and ASC 450, when we classify problem assets as substandard, doubtful, and loss, we may review the borrower and collateral to establish a specific loan loss allowance in an amount we deem prudent. Our credit administration department, management, and the Board of Directors review the analysis and approve the specific loan loss allowance for these loans. 
General reserve loan loss allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances on impaired loans, have not been specifically allocated to particular problem assets. When an institution identifies a problem asset as an unavoidable and imminent loss, it is required to partially or fully charge-off such assets in the period in which they are deemed uncollectible. Our determination as to the classification of our assets and the amount of our valuation allowances is subject to review by the DFI and the FDIC, who can order specific charge-offs or the establishment of additional loan loss allowances.
We review, at least quarterly, the problem assets in our portfolio to determine whether any assets require reclassification. On the basis of our review, as of December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, we had classified loans of $3.4 million, $6.7 million, and $3.3 million, respectively. We had no other classified assets at these dates. In addition, at December 31, 2018 we had $2.5 million of special mention loans. At December 31, 2018, classified assets represented 2.0% of equity capital and 0.3% of total assets. The decrease in classified assets during 
26

the year ended December 31, 2018 was mainly attributable to a commercial real estate and business loan relationship for $2.7 million that was upgraded from substandard. 
Classified loans, consisting solely of substandard loans, were as follows at the dates indicated:

Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses was $9.5 million, or 1.1% of total loans, at December 31, 2018, compared to $8.8 million, or 1.1%, at December 31, 2017. Management recognizes that loan losses may occur over the life of a loan and the allowance for loan losses must be maintained at a level necessary to absorb specific losses on impaired loans and probable losses inherent in the total loan portfolio. Monthly, our chief credit officer prepares a report of the allowance for loan losses and establishes the provision for credit losses based on the risk composition of our loan portfolio, delinquency levels, loss experience, economic conditions, regulatory examination results, seasoning of the loan portfolios, and other factors related to the collectability of the loan portfolio. This allowance for loan losses report is reviewed monthly by management. 
Quantitative analysis is necessary to calculate accounting estimates for loan loss reserves, and we also recognize that qualitative factors such as economic, market, industry and political changes can adversely affect loan quality. These qualitative factors are updated and approved by management on a quarterly basis. Each quarter, a report on the allowance for loan losses, including the application and discussion of quantitative and qualitative factors established during the quarter, is reviewed by the Board of Director's loan/asset quality committee and presented for approval to the full Board. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses, which is charged against current period operating results, and decreased by the amount of actual loan charge-offs, net of recoveries, and improvements in asset quality.
 Our methodology for analyzing the allowance for loan losses consists of two components: general and specific allowances. The formula for the general loan loss reserve allowance is determined by applying an estimated quantified loss percentage, as well as qualitative factors, to various groups of loans. First Federal uses a three year loss history including loss percentages based on various historical measures such as the amount and type of classified loans, past due ratios, loss experience, and economic conditions, which could affect the collectability of the respective loan types. Qualitative factors and adjustments to the loan loss reserve calculations are largely subjective but also include objective variables such as unemployment rates, falling or rising real estate values, real estate and retail sales, demographics and other known material economic indicators. A general allowance is then established, based upon the analysis of the above conditions, to recognize the inherent risk associated with the entire loan portfolio. A specific allowance is established when management believes the borrower’s financial and/or collateral condition has materially deteriorated to a point of impairment and loss is highly probable for that specific loan.
We define a loan as being impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable we will be unable to collect amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans, such as residential mortgage loans and consumer loans, are grouped together for impairment analysis and reserve calculation. All other loans are evaluated for impairment on an individual basis. In the process of identifying loans as impaired, management takes into consideration factors which include payment history, collateral value, financial condition of the borrower, and the probability of collecting scheduled payments in the future. Minor payment delays and insignificant payment shortfalls typically do not result in a loan being classified as impaired. The significance of payment delays and shortfalls is considered by management on a case-by-case basis, after taking into consideration the totality of circumstances surrounding the loans and borrowers, including payment history and amounts of any payment shortfall, length and reason for delay, and likelihood of return to stable performance. As of December 31, 2018, we had impaired loans of $6.6 million, compared to $6.1 million at December 31, 2017.
In determining specific reserves for those loans evaluated for impairment on an individual basis, management utilizes the valuation shown in the most recent appraisal of the collateral and may make adjustments to that valuation as additional information becomes available. Generally, appraisals or evaluations are updated subsequent to the time of origination, whenever management identifies a loan as impaired or potentially being impaired. Events which may trigger an updated appraisal or evaluation include, but are not limited to, borrower delinquency, material technical defaults, annual review of borrower’s financial condition, property tax and/or assessment delinquency, deferred maintenance or other information known or discovered by us.
Impaired collateral dependent loans require a current appraisal and analysis to determine the net value of the collateral for loan loss reserve purposes. Our policy is to update these appraisals every 12 months as long as the loan and collateral remains impaired, except for smaller balance, homogeneous loans, which are applied a reserve according to their risk weighting and loan class. Certain types of collateral, depending on market conditions, may require more frequent appraisals, updates or evaluations. When the results of the impairment analysis indicate a potential loss, the loan is classified as substandard and is analyzed to determine if a specific reserve amount is to be established or adjusted to reflect any further deterioration in the value of the collateral that may occur prior to 
28

liquidation or reinstatement. The impairment analysis takes into consideration the primary, secondary, and tertiary sources of repayment, whether impairment is likely to be temporary in nature or liquidation is anticipated.
Management believes that our allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2018 was adequate to absorb the known and inherent risks of loss in the loan portfolio at that date. While management believes the estimates and assumptions used in its determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future, or that the actual amount of future provisions will not exceed the amount of past provisions or that any increased provision that may be required will not adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the determination of the amount of our allowance for loan losses is subject to review by bank regulators, as part of the routine examination process, which may result in the establishment of additional reserves based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination.

Under Washington law, savings banks are permitted to invest in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various federal agencies, certain certificates of deposit of insured banks and savings institutions, banker’s acceptances, repurchase agreements, federal funds, commercial paper, investment grade corporate debt, and obligations of states and their political subdivisions.
Our chief financial officer has the responsibility for the management of our investment portfolio. Various factors are considered when making investment decisions, including the marketability, maturity and tax consequences of the proposed investment. The maturity structure of investments will be affected by various market conditions, including the current and anticipated slope of the yield curve, the level of interest rates, the trend of deposit inflows, and the anticipated demand for funds from deposit withdrawals and loan originations and purchases.
The general objective of our investment portfolio is to provide liquidity, maintain earnings, and manage risk, including credit, reinvestment, liquidity and interest rate risk.
Securities. Total investment securities decreased $33.9 million, or 10.0%, to $306.5 million at December 31, 2018, from $340.4 million at December 31, 2017, mainly a result of sales and principal payments partially offset by purchases. At December 31, 2018, U.S. government agency issued mortgage-backed securities ("MBS agency") still comprised the largest portion of our investment portfolio at 57.0%, followed by corporate issued asset-backed securities ("ABS corporate") at 12.0%, U.S. Small Business Administration securities ("SBA") at 11.7%, U.S. government agency issued asset-backed securities ("ABS agency") at 8.4%, municipal bonds at 4.2%, corporate issued mortgage-backed securities ("MBS corporate") at 3.5%, and corporate issued debt securities ("Corporate Debt") at 3.2%. The decrease in investment securities was the result of decreases in municipal bonds of $14.6 million, SBA securities of $11.7 million, corporate debt of $10.0 million, MBS Corporate of $9.9 million, and MBS Agency of $5.6 million, partially offset by increases in ABS Corporate of $14.0 million and ABS Agency of $4.0 million. The estimated average time for rates to reset on our investment portfolio was 3.7 years at December 31, 2018 as compared to 3.5 years at December 31, 2017. The estimated average life of the total investment securities portfolio was 5.0 years at December 31, 2018 and 5.3 years at December 31, 2017.
The issuers of MBS agency securities held in our portfolio, which include Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Government National Mortgage Association ("Ginnie Mae"), and certain issuers of agency bonds held in our portfolio, which include FHLB, Fannie Mae, and the U.S. Small Business Administration, guarantee the timely principal and interest payments in the event of default. ABS agency bonds held in our portfolio include securities issued by CIT Education Loan Trust, which are backed by student loans in a subordinate tranche, and Sallie Mae Student Loan Trust and ATCLO Loan Trust in a non-subordinated tranche, where payment is not guaranteed by the issuer. The underlying student loans are reinsured by the U.S. Department of Education, which mitigates a significant portion of their risk of loss. Municipal bonds consist of a mix of non-taxable, revenue and general obligation bonds issued by various local and state government entities that use their revenue-generating and taxing authority as a source of repayment of their debt. Our municipal bonds are considered investment grade, and we monitor their credit quality on an ongoing basis.
ABS and MBS corporate securities have no guarantees in the event of default and therefore warrant continued monitoring for credit quality. Our MBS corporate securities consist of fixed and variable rate mortgages issued by various corporations, and our ABS corporate securities consist of a mix of variable rate collateralized loan obligations in managed funds, which we believe have sufficient subordination to mitigate the risk of loss on these investments, and certain debt securities issued by Citigroup. Monitoring of these securities may include, but is not limited to, reviewing credit quality standards such as delinquency, subordination, and credit ratings. Our corporate securities are considered investment grade.
As a member of the FHLB, we had an average balance of $6.8 million in stock of the FHLB for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. We received $311,000, $81,000, and $126,000 in dividends from the FHLB during the year ended December 31, 2018, the six month transition period ended December 31, 2017, and the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, respectively.

Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds
General. Deposits, borrowings and loan repayments are the major sources of our funds for lending and other investment purposes. Scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are influenced significantly by general interest rates and market conditions. Borrowings from the FHLB are used to supplement the availability of funds from other sources and also as a source of term funds to assist in the management of interest rate risk.
Our deposit composition consists of certificates of deposit accounting for 27.8% of the total deposits at December 31, 2018, and interest and noninterest-bearing checking, savings and money market accounts comprising the remaining balance of total deposits. We rely on marketing activities, convenience, customer service and the availability of a broad range of deposit products and services to attract and retain customer deposits. We did not have any brokered deposits at December 31, 2018.
Deposits. Deposits are attracted from within our market area through the offering of a broad selection of deposit instruments, including checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts and certificates of deposit with a variety of rates. Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time periods the funds must remain on deposit, and the interest rate, among other factors. In determining the terms of our deposit accounts, we consider the development of long-term profitable customer relationships, current market interest rates, current maturity structure and deposit mix, our customer preferences, and the profitability of acquiring customer deposits compared to alternative sources.

The Federal Reserve requires First Federal to maintain reserves on transaction accounts or non-personal time deposits. These reserves may be in the form of cash or noninterest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. Negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts and other types of accounts that permit payments or transfers to third parties fall within the definition of transaction accounts and are subject to the reserve requirements, as are any non-personal time deposits at a savings bank. As of December 31, 2018, our deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and vault cash exceeded our reserve requirements.

Borrowings. We use advances from the FHLB, including short-term overnight to less than one year advances and longer term advances maturing in one year or more, to supplement our supply of lendable funds, to meet short-term liquidity needs, and to mitigate interest rate risk.
As a member of the FHLB, we are required to own capital stock in the FHLB and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of that stock and certain pledged assets including mortgage loans and investment securities. Advances are made under various terms pursuant to several different credit programs, each with its own interest rate and range of maturities. Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of advances are based on the financial condition of the member institution and the adequacy of collateral pledged to secure the credit. We maintain a committed credit facility with the FHLB and at December 31, 2018 had pledged loan and security collateral to support a borrowing capacity of $236.1 million. At that date outstanding advances from the FHLB totaled $136.6 million leaving a remaining borrowing capacity of $99.5 million.
The following tables set forth information regarding our borrowings at the end of and during the periods indicated. The tables include both long- and short-term borrowings.

Subsidiary and Other Activities
First Federal has one active subsidiary, 202 Master Tenant, LLC, which was formed in August 2016 in partnership with the Peninsula College Foundation in order to receive a historic tax credit. This entity meets the criteria for reporting under the equity method of accounting.
Competition
We face competition in originating loans from other savings institutions, commercial banks, credit unions, life insurance companies, and mortgage bankers. We offer competitive terms and conditions and also compete by delivering high-quality, personal service to our customers.
Competition for deposits is primarily from other savings institutions, commercial banks, credit unions, mutual funds, and other alternative investments, which may be offered locally or via the Internet. We compete for these deposits by offering excellent service and a variety of deposit accounts at competitive rates. Based on the most recent branch data provided by the FDIC, as of June 30, 2018, First Federal’s share of bank, savings bank and savings and loan association deposits in Clallam and Jefferson counties was 36.2% and 22.2%, respectively, and was less than 2% in Whatcom and Kitsap counties.

How We Are Regulated
First Northwest Bancorp and First Federal are subject to federal, state, and local laws which may change from time to time. This section provides a general overview of the federal and state regulatory framework applicable to First Northwest Bancorp and First Federal. The descriptions of laws and regulations included herein do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the actual laws and regulations. 
These statutes and regulations, as well as related policies, continue to be subject to change by Congress, state legislatures, and federal and state regulators. Changes in statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies applicable to First Northwest Bancorp and First Federal (including their interpretation or implementation) cannot be predicted and could have a material effect on First Northwest Bancorp’s and First Federal’s business and operations. Numerous changes to the statutes, regulations, and regulatory policies applicable to First Northwest Bancorp and First Federal have been made or proposed in recent years. Any such legislation or regulatory changes in the future by the FDIC, DFI, Federal Reserve and the CFPB could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. 
Regulation of First Federal
General. First Federal, as a state-chartered savings bank, is subject to applicable provisions of Washington law and to regulations and examinations of the DFI. It also is subject to examination and regulation by the FDIC, which insures the deposits of First Federal to the maximum permitted by law. During these state or federal regulatory examinations, the examiners may, among other things, require First Federal to provide for higher general or specific loan loss reserves, which can impact our capital and earnings. This regulation of First Federal is intended for the protection of depositors and the deposit insurance fund ("DIF") of the FDIC and not for the purpose of protecting shareholders of First Federal or First Northwest Bancorp. First Federal is required to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital and is subject to some limitations on the payment of dividends to First Northwest Bancorp. See "– Capital Requirements" and "– Dividends."
Federal and State Enforcement Authority and Actions. As part of its supervisory authority over Washington-chartered savings banks, the DFI may initiate enforcement proceedings to obtain a cease-and-desist order against an institution believed to have engaged in unsafe and unsound practices or to have violated a law, regulation, or other regulatory limit, including a written agreement. The FDIC also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against insured institutions for similar reasons and may terminate the deposit insurance if it determines that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition. Both these agencies may utilize less formal supervisory tools to address their concerns about the condition, operations or compliance status of a savings bank.
Regulation by the Washington Department of Financial Institutions. State law and regulations govern First Federal's ability to take deposits and pay interest, to make loans on or invest in residential and other real estate, to make consumer loans, to invest in securities, to offer various banking services to its customers, and to establish branch offices. As a state savings bank, First Federal must pay semi-annual assessments, examination costs and certain other charges to the DFI. 
Washington law generally provides the same powers for Washington savings banks as federally and other-state chartered savings institutions and banks with branches in Washington, subject to the approval of the DFI. Washington savings banks are permitted to charge the maximum interest rates on loans and other extensions of credit to Washington residents which are allowable for a national bank in another state if higher than Washington limits. In addition, the DFI may approve applications by Washington savings banks to engage in an otherwise unauthorized activity if the DFI determines that the activity is closely related to banking and First Federal is otherwise qualified under the statute. This additional authority, however, is subject to review and approval by the FDIC if the activity is not permissible for national banks.

Regulation of Management. Federal law (1) sets forth circumstances under which officers or directors of a bank may be removed by the bank's federal supervisory agency; (2) as discussed below, places restraints on lending by a bank to its executive officers, directors, principal shareholders, and their related interests; and (3) generally prohibits management personnel of a bank from serving as directors or in other management positions of another financial institution whose assets exceed a specified amount or which has an office within a specified geographic area.
Insider Credit Transactions. Banks are subject to certain restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, principal shareholders, and their related interests. Extensions of credit (1) must be made on substantially the same terms (including interest rates and collateral) and follow credit underwriting procedures that are at least as stringent as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not related to the lending bank; and (2) must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. Banks are also subject to certain lending limits and restrictions on overdrafts to insiders. A violation of these restrictions may result in the assessment of substantial civil monetary penalties, regulatory enforcement actions, and other regulatory sanctions. The Dodd-Frank Act and federal regulations place additional restrictions on loans to insiders and generally prohibit loans to senior officers other than for certain specified purposes.
Insurance of Accounts and Regulation by the FDIC. The DIF of the FDIC insures deposit accounts in First Federal up to $250,000 per separately insured depositor. As insurer, the FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of, and to require reporting by, FDIC-insured institutions. Our deposit insurance premiums for the year ended December 31, 2018, were $307,000. No institution may pay a dividend if it is in default on its federal deposit insurance assessment.
The FDIC calculates assessments for small institutions (those with less than $10 billion in assets) based on an institution’s weighted average CAMELS component ratings and certain financial ratios. Currently, assessment rates range from 3 to 16 basis points for institutions with CAMELS composite ratings of 1 or 2, 6 to 30 basis points for those with a CAMELS composite score of 3, and 16 to 30 basis points for those with CAMELS Composite scores of 4 or 5, subject to certain adjustments. Assessment rates are scheduled to decrease in the future as the reserve ratio increases. The reserve ratio is the ratio of the net worth of the deposit insurance fund to aggregate insured deposits.
As required by the Dodd Frank Act, the FDIC has adopted a rule to offset the effect of the increase in the minimum reserve ratio of the DIF on small institutions by imposing a surcharge on institutions with assets of $10 billion or more commencing on July 1, 2016 and ending when the reserve ratio reaches 1.35%. On September 30, 2018, the DIF reached 1.36%, ahead of Dodd-Frank's 2020 deadline to meet the 1.35% reserve ratio. As a result, small institutions will receive credits for the portions of their regular assessments that contributed to growth in the reserve ratio between 1.15% and 1.35%, to be applied when the reserve ratio is at or above 1.38%.
FDIC-insured institutions are required to pay an additional quarterly assessment called the FICO assessment in order to fund the interest on bonds issued to resolve thrift failures in the 1980s. This assessment rate is adjusted quarterly to reflect changes in the assessment base, which is average assets less tangible equity, and is the same base as used for the deposit insurance assessment. These assessments are expected to continue until the bonds mature in the years 2017 through 2019.
The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments, and any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of First Federal. Management cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future.
Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. The FDIC may also prohibit any insured institution from engaging in any activity determined by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the DIF. We do not currently know of any practice, condition, or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance.
Prompt Corrective Action. Federal statutes establish a supervisory framework, designed to place restrictions on an insured depository institution if its capital levels begin to show signs of weakness, based on five capital categories: "well capitalized," "adequately capitalized," "undercapitalized," "significantly undercapitalized" and "critically undercapitalized." An institution’s category depends upon where its capital levels are in relation to relevant capital measures, which include risk-based capital measures, Tier 1 and common equity Tier 1 capital measures, a leverage ratio capital measure and certain other factors. The federal banking agencies have adopted 
43

regulations that implement this statutory framework. Under these regulations, an institution is treated as well capitalized if it has a ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 10.0% or more (the total risk-based capital ratio); a ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets (the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio) of 8.0% or more; a ratio of Tier 1 common equity capital to risk-weighted assets of 6.5% or more (the common equity Tier 1 capital ratio); a ratio of Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets (the leverage ratio) of 5.0% or more; and the institution is not subject to a federal order, agreement or directive to meet a specific capital level. An institution is considered adequately capitalized if it is not well capitalized but it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or more; a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or more; a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% or more; and a leverage ratio of 4.0% or more and a leverage ratio of not less than 4%. The classifications for “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” institutions are also set forth in the regulations. An institution that is not well capitalized is subject to certain restrictions on brokered deposits, including restrictions on the rates it can offer on its deposits generally. Any institution which is neither well capitalized nor adequately capitalized is considered undercapitalized. Further, an institution may be downgraded to a category lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition, or if the institution receives an unsatisfactory examination rating.
Undercapitalized institutions are subject to certain prompt corrective action requirements, regulatory controls and restrictions which become more extensive as an institution becomes more severely undercapitalized. Failure by First Federal to comply with applicable capital requirements would, if not remedied, result in restrictions on its activities and lead to enforcement actions, including, but not limited to, the issuance of a capital directive to ensure the maintenance of required capital levels and, ultimately, the appointment of the FDIC as receiver or conservator. Banking regulators will take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. Additionally, approval of any regulatory application filed for their review may be dependent on compliance with capital requirements. At December 31, 2018, First Federal was categorized as “well capitalized” under the regulatory capital requirements described below. For additional information, see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," of this Form 10-K.
Capital Requirements. Federal regulations require insured depository institutions and bank holding companies to meet several minimum capital standards. The minimum capital level requirements applicable to First Northwest Bancorp and First Federal are: (i) a common equity Tier 1 ("CET1") capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6%; (iii) a total capital to risk-based assets ratio of 8%; and (iv) a Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio of 4%. These minimum capital requirements became effective in January 2015 and were the result of final rules implementing certain regulatory amendments based on the recommendation of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act.
In addition to the minimum risk-based capital ratios, the capital regulations require a capital conservation buffer, designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress, consisting of additional CET1 capital of more than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum risk-based ratios in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses. The phase-in of the capital conservation buffer requirement began on January 1, 2016, when a buffer greater than 0.625% of risk-weighted assets was required, and increased each year until the buffer requirement was fully implemented on January 1, 2019.
As of December 31, 2018, First Northwest Bancorp and First Federal each met the requirements to be "well capitalized" and met the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer requirement. Management monitors the capital levels of First Northwest Bancorp and First Federal to provide for current and future business opportunities and to meet regulatory guidelines for “well capitalized” institutions. For additional information regarding First Northwest Bancorp’s and First Federal’s required and actual capital levels at December 31, 2018, see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," of this Form 10-K. 
The Federal Reserve and the FDIC have authority to establish individual minimum capital requirements in appropriate cases upon a determination that an institution’s capital level is or may become inadequate in light of particular risks or circumstances. Management believes that, under the current regulations, First Northwest Bancorp and First Federal will continue to meet their minimum capital requirements in the foreseeable future.
Standards for Safety and Soundness. The federal banking regulatory agencies have prescribed, by regulation, guidelines for all insured depository institutions relating to internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems; loan documentation; credit underwriting; interest rate risk exposure; asset growth; asset quality; earnings; and compensation, fees and benefits. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards 
44

that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. Each insured depository institution must implement a comprehensive written information security program that includes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards appropriate to the institution’s size and complexity and the nature and scope of its activities. The information security program must be designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, protect against any unanticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information, protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer, and ensure the proper disposal of customer and consumer information. Each insured depository institution must also develop and implement a risk-based response program to address incidents of unauthorized access to customer information in customer information systems. If the FDIC determines that an institution fails to meet any of these guidelines, it may require an institution to submit to the FDIC an acceptable plan to achieve compliance. First Federal has established comprehensive policies and risk management procedures to ensure the safety and soundness of First Federal.
Federal Home Loan Bank System. First Federal is a member of the FHLB of Des Moines. As a member, First Federal is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB. At December 31, 2018, First Federal held $6.9 million in FHLB stock, which was in compliance with this requirement. Each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region, and it is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the Federal Home Loan Bank System. Each FHLB makes loans or advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures, established by its Board of Directors, subject to the oversight of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. All advances from the FHLB are required to be fully secured by sufficient collateral as determined by the FHLB, and all long-term advances are required to provide funds for residential home financing. At December 31, 2018, First Federal had $136.6 million of outstanding advances from the FHLB of Des Moines. See Item 1, "Business – Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds – Borrowings."
The FHLBs continue to contribute to low- and moderately-priced housing programs through direct loans or interest subsidies on advances targeted for community investment and low- and moderate-income housing projects. These contributions have affected adversely the level of FHLB dividends paid and could continue to do so in the future. These contributions could also have an adverse effect on the value of FHLB stock in the future. A reduction in value of First Federal's FHLB of Des Moines stock may result in a corresponding reduction in its capital.
Activities and Investments of Insured State-Chartered Financial Institutions. Federal law generally limits the activities and equity investments of FDIC insured, state-chartered banks to those that are permissible for national banks. An insured state bank is not prohibited from, among other things, (1) acquiring or retaining a majority interest in a subsidiary, (2) investing as a limited partner in a partnership, the sole purpose of which is direct or indirect investment in the acquisition, rehabilitation or new construction of a qualified housing project, provided that such limited partnership investments may not exceed 2% of the bank’s total assets, (3) acquiring up to 10% of the voting stock of a company that solely provides or reinsures directors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage or bankers’ blanket bond group insurance coverage for insured depository institutions, and (4) acquiring or retaining the voting shares of a depository institution if certain requirements are met.
Dividends. Dividends from First Federal, which are subject to regulation and limitation, constitute a major source of funds for dividends paid by First Northwest Bancorp to shareholders. As a general rule, regulatory authorities may prohibit banks and bank holding companies from paying dividends in a manner that would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. For example, regulators have stated that paying dividends that deplete an institution's capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice and that an institution should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. In addition, a bank may not pay cash dividends if that payment could reduce the amount of its capital below that necessary to meet minimum applicable regulatory capital requirements. According to Washington law, First Federal may not declare or pay a cash dividend on its capital stock if it would cause its net worth to be reduced below (1) the amount required for liquidation accounts or (2) the net worth requirements, if any, imposed by the Director of the DFI. Dividends on First Federal’s capital stock may not be paid in an aggregate amount greater than the aggregate retained earnings of First Federal without the approval of the Director of the DFI.
Affiliate Transactions. Federal laws strictly limit the ability of banks to engage in certain transactions with their affiliates, including their bank holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act further extended the definition of an “affiliate” and treats credit exposure arising from derivative transactions, securities lending, and borrowing transactions as covered transactions under the regulations. Transactions deemed to be a “covered transaction” under Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act and between a subsidiary bank and its parent company or the nonbank subsidiaries of the bank holding company are limited to 10% of the bank subsidiary’s capital and surplus and, with respect to the parent company and all such nonbank subsidiaries, to an aggregate of 20% of the bank subsidiary’s 
45

capital and surplus. Further, covered transactions that are loans and extensions of credit generally are required to be secured by eligible collateral in specified amounts. Federal law also requires that covered transactions and certain other transactions listed in Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act between a bank and its affiliates be on terms as favorable to the bank as transactions with non-affiliates.
Community Reinvestment Act. First Federal is subject to the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (CRA), which requires the appropriate federal bank regulatory agency to assess a bank’s performance under the CRA in meeting the credit needs of the community serviced by the bank, including low-and moderate income neighborhoods. The regulatory agency’s assessment of a bank’s record is made available to the public. Further, a bank’s CRA performance rating must be considered in connection with a bank’s application, among other things, to establish a new branch office that will accept deposits; to relocate an existing office; or to merge or consolidate with, or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of, a federally regulated financial institution. In some cases, a bank's failure to comply with the CRA or CRA protests filed by interested parties during applicable comment periods can result in the denial or delay of such transactions. First Federal received a “satisfactory” rating during its most recent CRA examination. 
Commercial Real Estate Ratios. The federal banking regulators recently issued guidance reminding financial institutions to reexamine the existing regulations regarding concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The purpose of the guidance is to guide banks in developing risk management practices and capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of real estate concentrations. The banking regulators are directed to examine each bank’s exposure to commercial real estate loans that are dependent on cash flow from the real estate held as collateral and to focus their supervisory resources on institutions that may have significant commercial real estate loan concentration risk. The guidance provides that the strength of an institution’s lending and risk management practices with respect to such concentrations will be taken into account in evaluating capital adequacy and does not specifically limit a bank’s commercial real estate lending to a specified concentration level.
Privacy Standards. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 (GLBA) modernized the financial services industry by establishing a comprehensive framework to permit affiliations among commercial banks, insurance companies, securities firms and other financial service providers. First Federal is subject to FDIC regulations implementing the privacy protection provisions of the GLBA. These regulations require First Federal to disclose its privacy policy, including informing consumers of its information sharing practices and informing consumers of its rights to opt out of certain practices.
Environmental Issues Associated with Real Estate Lending. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA") is a federal statute that generally imposes strict liability on all prior and present "owners and operators" of sites containing hazardous waste. However, the term "owner and operator" excludes a person whose ownership is limited to protecting its security interest in the site. Since the enactment of the CERCLA, this "secured creditor exemption" has been the subject of judicial interpretations which have left open the possibility that lenders could be liable for cleanup costs on contaminated property that they hold as collateral for a loan. To the extent that legal uncertainty exists in this area, all creditors, including First Federal, that have made loans secured by properties with potential hazardous waste contamination (such as petroleum contamination) could be subject to liability for cleanup costs, which costs often substantially exceed the value of the collateral property.
Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve Board requires that all depository institutions maintain reserves on transaction accounts or non-personal time deposits. These reserves may be in the form of cash or noninterest-bearing deposits with the regional Federal Reserve Bank. Negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts and other types of accounts that permit payments or transfers to third parties fall within the definition of transaction accounts and are subject to the reserve requirements, as are any non-personal time deposits at a savings bank. As of December 31, 2018, First Federal's deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank and vault cash exceeded its reserve requirements.
Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism. The Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) requires all financial institutions to establish a risk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The BSA also sets forth various recordkeeping and reporting requirements (such as reporting suspicious activities that might signal criminal activity) and certain due diligence and "know your customer" documentation requirements.
The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (“Patriot Act”), intended to combat terrorism, was renewed with certain amendments in 2006. 
46

In relevant part, the Patriot Act (1) prohibits banks from providing correspondent accounts directly to foreign shell banks; (2) imposes due diligence requirements on banks opening or holding accounts for foreign financial institutions or wealthy foreign individuals; (3) requires financial institutions to establish an anti-money laundering compliance program; and (4) eliminates civil liability for persons who file suspicious activity reports. The Patriot Act also includes provisions providing the government with power to investigate terrorism, including expanded government access to bank account records. Regulators are directed to consider a bank holding company’s and a bank’s effectiveness in combating money laundering when reviewing and ruling on applications under the BHCA and the Bank Merger Act. First Northwest Bancorp and First Federal have established comprehensive compliance programs designed to comply with the requirements of the BSA and Patriot Act.
Other Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations. The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, established the CFPB as an independent bureau of the Federal Reserve Board. The CFPB assumed responsibility for the implementation of the federal financial consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations and has authority to impose new requirements. First Federal is subject to consumer protection regulations issued by the CFPB, but as a smaller financial institution, it is generally subject to supervision and enforcement by the FDIC and the DFI with respect to our compliance with consumer financial protection laws and CFPB regulations.
First Federal is subject to a broad array of federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations that govern almost every aspect of its business relationships with consumers. While the list set forth below is not exhaustive, some of these laws and regulations include the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act, the Consumer Leasing Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act, the Homeowners Protection Act, the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, laws governing flood insurance, laws governing consumer protections in connection with the sale of insurance, federal and state laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive business practices, and various regulations that implement some or all of the foregoing. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans, collecting loans, and providing other services. In recent years, examination and enforcement by federal and state banking agencies for non-compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations have increased and become more intense. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can subject First Federal to various penalties including, but not limited to, enforcement actions, injunctions, fines, civil liability, criminal penalties, punitive damages, and the loss of certain contractual rights. First Federal has established a comprehensive compliance system to ensure consumer protection.
Regulation and Supervision of First Northwest Bancorp
General. First Northwest Bancorp is a bank holding company registered with the Federal Reserve and the sole shareholder of First Federal. Bank holding companies are subject to comprehensive regulation by the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHCA”), and the regulations promulgated thereunder. This regulation and oversight is generally intended to ensure that First Northwest Bancorp limits its activities to those allowed by law and that it operates in a safe and sound manner without endangering the financial health of First Federal.
As a bank holding company, First Northwest Bancorp is required to file semi-annual and annual reports with the Federal Reserve and any additional information required by the Federal Reserve and is subject to regular examinations by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve also has extensive enforcement authority over bank holding companies, including the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to require that a holding company divest subsidiaries (including its bank subsidiaries). In general, enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of law and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices.
The Bank Holding Company Act. Under the BHCA, First Northwest Bancorp is supervised by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has a policy that a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act and earlier Federal Reserve policy provide that bank holding companies should serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks by being prepared to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity (including at times when a bank holding company may not be in a financial position to provide such resources or when it may not be in the bank holding company’s or its shareholders' best interests to do so), and should maintain the financial flexibility and capital raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks. Any capital loans a bank 
47

holding company makes to its bank subsidiaries are subordinate to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the bank subsidiaries. A bank holding company's failure to meet its obligation to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the Federal Reserve to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of the Federal Reserve's regulations, or both.
Under the BHCA, the Federal Reserve may approve the ownership of shares by a bank holding company in any company the activities of which the Federal Reserve has determined to be so closely related to the business of banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. These activities generally include, among others, operating a savings institution, mortgage company, finance company, credit card company or factoring company; performing certain data processing operations; providing certain investment and financial advice; underwriting and acting as an insurance agent for certain types of credit-related insurance; leasing property on a full-payout, non-operating basis; selling money orders, travelers' checks and U.S. Savings Bonds; real estate and personal property appraising; providing tax planning and preparation services; and, subject to certain limitations, providing securities brokerage services for customers. 
Acquisitions. The BHCA prohibits a bank holding company, with certain exceptions, from acquiring ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company and from engaging in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or providing services for its subsidiaries. A bank holding company that meets certain supervisory and financial standards and elects to be designed as a financial holding company may also engage in certain securities, insurance and merchant banking activities and other activities determined to be financial in nature or incidental to financial activities.
Regulatory Capital Requirements. The Federal Reserve has adopted capital rules pursuant to which it assesses the adequacy of capital in examining and supervising a bank holding company and in analyzing applications under the BHCA. These rules apply on a consolidated basis to bank holding companies with $3.0 billion (which was increased from $1.0 billion in conjunction with the Crapo Bill, discussed below) or more in assets, or with fewer assets but certain risky activities, and on a bank-only basis to other companies. When applicable, the bank holding company capital adequacy and conservation buffer rules are the same as those imposed by the FDIC. For additional information, see the section above entitled “- Regulation of First Federal - Capital Regulation” and Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8., "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," of this Form 10-K.
Interstate Banking. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated interstate branching restrictions that were implemented as part of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 ("Interstate Act"), and removed many restrictions on de novo interstate branching by state and federally chartered banks. The Federal Reserve may approve an application of a bank holding company to acquire control of, or acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, a bank located in a state other than the bank holding company's home state, without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited by the laws of any state. The Federal Reserve may not approve the acquisition of a bank that has not been in existence for the minimum time period of five years, or longer if specified by the law of the host state. In addition, the Federal Reserve generally may not approve an application for an interstate merger transaction if the applicant controls or would control more than 10% of the insured deposits in the United States or 30% or more of the deposits in the target bank's home state or in any state in which the target bank maintains a branch. Federal law does not affect the authority of states to limit the percentage of total insured deposits in the state that may be held or controlled by a bank holding company to the extent such limitation does not discriminate against out-of-state banks or bank holding companies. Individual states may also waive the 30% state-wide concentration limit contained in the federal law. Banks may establish de novo branches in any state, subject to regulatory approval.
The federal banking agencies are authorized to approve interstate merger transactions without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited by the law of any state, unless the home state of one of the banks adopted a law prior to June 1, 1997, which applies equally to all out-of-state banks and expressly prohibits merger transactions involving out-of-state banks. Interstate acquisitions of branches are permitted only if the law of the state in which the branch is located permits such acquisitions. Interstate mergers and branch acquisitions are also subject to the nationwide and statewide insured deposit concentration amounts described above. Federal bank regulations prohibit banks from using their interstate branches primarily for deposit production and federal bank regulatory agencies have implemented a loan-to-deposit ratio screen to ensure compliance with this prohibition.
Interchange Fees. Under the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve adopted rules establishing standards for assessing whether the interchange fees that may be charged with respect to certain electronic transactions are "reasonable and proportional" to the costs incurred by issuers for processing such transactions. Notably, the Federal Reserve's rules set a maximum permissible interchange fee, among other 
48

requirements. As of December 31, 2018, First Northwest Bancorp and First Federal qualified for the small issuer exemption from the Federal Reserve’s interchange fee cap, which applies to any debit card issuer that has total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion as of the end of the previous calendar year.
Restrictions on Dividends. First Northwest Bancorp's ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to the Federal Reserve limits and Washington law, and it may depend on its ability to receive dividends from First Federal (as discussed above).
The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies. In particular, the policy limits the payment of a cash dividend by a bank holding company if the holding company's net income for the past year is not sufficient to cover both the cash dividend and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. A bank holding company that does not meet any applicable capital standard would not be able to pay any cash dividends under this policy. A bank holding company not subject to consolidated capital requirements is expected not to pay dividends unless its debt-to-equity ratio is less than 1:1, and it meets certain additional criteria. The Federal Reserve also has indicated that it would be inappropriate for a company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. The capital conservation buffer requirements may limit First Northwest Bancorp's ability to pay dividends.
Except for a company that meets the well-capitalized standard for bank holding companies, is well managed, and is not subject to any unresolved supervisory issues, a bank holding company is required to give the Federal Reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10.0% or more of the company's consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law, regulation or regulatory order, condition, or written agreement.
Under Washington corporate law, First Northwest Bancorp generally may not pay dividends if after that payment it would not be able to pay its liabilities as they become due in the usual course of business, or its total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities. These various laws and regulatory policies may affect First Northwest Bancorp’s ability to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions.
Tying Arrangements. First Northwest Bancorp and First Federal are prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit, sale or lease of property, or furnishing of services. For example, with certain exceptions, neither First Northwest Bancorp nor First Federal may condition an extension of credit to a customer on either (1) a requirement that the customer obtain additional services provided by First Northwest Bancorp or First Federal; or (2) an agreement by the customer to refrain from obtaining other services from a competitor.
The Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law in July 2010 and imposes restrictions and an expanded framework of regulatory oversight for financial institutions, including depository institutions, and required new capital regulations that are discussed above under “- Regulation of First Federal - Capital Regulations.” In addition, among other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act requires public companies, like First Northwest Bancorp, to (i) provide their shareholders with a non-binding vote (a) at least once every three years on the compensation paid to executive officers and (b) at least once every six years on whether they should have a “say on pay” vote every one, two or three years; (ii) have a separate, non-binding shareholder vote regarding golden parachutes for named executive officers when a shareholder vote takes place on mergers, acquisitions, dispositions or other transactions that would trigger the parachute payments; and (iii) provide disclosure in annual proxy materials concerning the relationship between the executive compensation paid and the financial performance of the issuer. In August 2015, the SEC adopted a rule mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act that requires a public company to disclose the ratio of the Chief Executive Officer's annual total compensation to the median annual total compensation of all other employees. The rule is intended to provide shareholders with information that they can use to evaluate a Chief Executive Officer’s compensation.
Federal Securities Law. The stock of First Northwest Bancorp is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. As a result, First Northwest Bancorp is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
49

First Northwest Bancorp stock held by persons who are affiliates of First Northwest Bancorp may not be resold without registration unless sold in accordance with certain resale restrictions. Affiliates are generally considered to be officers, directors and principal shareholders. If First Northwest Bancorp meets specified current public information requirements, each affiliate of First Northwest Bancorp will be able to sell in the public market, without registration, a limited number of shares in any three-month period.
The SEC has adopted regulations and policies under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that apply to First Northwest Bancorp as a registered company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The stated goals of these Sarbanes-Oxley requirements are to increase corporate responsibility, provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. The SEC and Sarbanes-Oxley-related regulations and policies include very specific additional disclosure requirements and new corporate governance rules. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act represents significant federal involvement in matters traditionally left to state regulatory systems, such as the regulation of the accounting profession, and to state corporate law, such as the relationship between a board of directors and management and between a board of directors and its committees.
Recent and Proposed Legislation. The economic and political environment of the past several years has led to a number of proposed legislative, governmental, and regulatory initiatives that may significantly impact the banking industry. Other regulatory initiatives by federal and state agencies may also significantly impact First Northwest Bancorp's and First Federal’s business. First Northwest Bancorp and First Federal cannot predict whether these or any other proposals will be enacted or the ultimate impact of any such initiatives on its operations, competitive situation, financial conditions, or results of operations. While recent history has demonstrated that new legislation or changes to existing laws or regulations typically result in a greater compliance burden (and therefore increase the general costs of doing business), the current administration has expressed an attempt to reduce these regulatory burdens. For instance, in May 2018, President Trump signed into law the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the “Crapo Bill”), which is bipartisan legislation that rolls back certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act to provide regulatory relief to certain financial institutions.
Effects of Federal Government Monetary Policy. First Northwest Bancorp’s earnings and growth are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government, particularly the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve implements national monetary policy to promote maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. Through its open market operations in U.S. government securities, control of the discount rate applicable to borrowings, establishment of reserve requirements against certain deposits, and control of the interest rate applicable to excess reserve balances and reverse repurchase agreements, the Federal Reserve influences the availability and cost of money and credit and, ultimately, a range of economic variables including employment, output, and the prices of goods and services. The nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies and their impact on First Northwest Bancorp and First Federal cannot be predicted with certainty.
Taxation
Federal Taxation
General. First Northwest Bancorp and First Federal are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to First Northwest Bancorp or First Federal. First Federal is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations by tax authorities for years ended before June 30, 2015. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," of this Form 10-K.
First Northwest Bancorp will file a consolidated federal income tax return with First Federal. Accordingly, any cash distributions made by First Northwest Bancorp to its shareholders would be considered to be taxable dividends and not as a non‑taxable return of capital to shareholders for federal and state tax purposes.
Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, First Federal currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting. Beginning with the six months ended December 31, 2017, federal income tax returns are filed using a December 31 year end. Prior periods, through June 30, 2017, used a fiscal year ending on June 30 for filing its federal income tax return.
50

Corporate Dividends‑Received Deduction. First Northwest Bancorp may eliminate from its income dividends received from First Federal as a wholly owned subsidiary of First Northwest Bancorp if it elects to file a consolidated return with First Federal. The corporate dividends-received deduction is 100%, or 65%, in the case of dividends received from corporations with which a corporate recipient does not file a consolidated tax return, depending on the level of stock ownership of the payor of the dividend. Corporations which own less than 20% of the stock of a corporation distributing a dividend may deduct 50% of dividends received or accrued on their behalf.
Charitable Contribution Carryovers. The Company may carryforward charitable contributions to the succeeding five taxable years. The utilization of the charitable contribution carryforward may not exceed 10% of taxable income as defined by the federal taxation laws. At December 31, 2018, the Company had a charitable contribution carryforward for federal income tax purposes of $7.2 million. This carryforward was generated from the Company’s creation of the First Federal Community Foundation to which it contributed 933,360 shares of its common stock and $400,000 in cash in connection with the mutual to stock conversion. Management does not fully expect to utilize the benefit over the five year carryforward period and has recorded a reserve on the portion of the related deferred tax asset estimated to expire unused.
Washington Taxation
First Federal is subject to a business and occupation tax imposed under Washington law at the rate of 1.5% of gross receipts. Interest received on loans secured by mortgages or deeds of trust on residential properties and certain investment securities are exempt from this tax.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors
First Northwest Bancorp and Subsidiary
Port Angeles, Washington
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of First Northwest Bancorp and Subsidiary (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2018, the six months ended December 31, 2017, and each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2017, and related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2018, the six months ended December 31, 2017, and each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2017, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting included in Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. 
97

Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

FIRST NORTHWEST BANCORP AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Nature of operations - First Northwest Bancorp, a Washington corporation ("First Northwest"), became the holding company of First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Port Angeles ("First Federal" or the "Bank") on January 29, 2015, upon completion of the Bank's conversion from a mutual to stock form of organization (the "Conversion"). First Northwest and the Bank are collectively referred to as the "Company." In connection with the Conversion, the Company issued an aggregate of 12,167,000 shares of common stock at an offering price of $10.00 per share for gross proceeds of $121.7 million. An additional 933,360 shares of Company common stock and $400,000 in cash were contributed to the First Federal Community Foundation ("Foundation"), a charitable foundation that was established in connection with the conversion, resulting in the issuance of a total of 13,100,360 shares. The Company received $117.6 million in net proceeds from the stock offering of which $58.4 million were contributed to the Bank upon Conversion.
At the time of Conversion, the Bank established a liquidation account in an amount equal to its total net worth, approximately $79.7 million, as of June 30, 2014, the latest statement of financial condition appearing in First Northwest's prospectus. The liquidation account is maintained for the benefit of eligible depositors who continue to maintain their accounts at the Bank after the conversion. The liquidation account is reduced annually to the extent that eligible depositors have reduced their qualifying deposits. Subsequent increases will not restore an eligible holder’s interest in the liquidation account. In the event of a complete liquidation, each eligible depositor will be entitled to receive a distribution from the liquidation account in an amount proportionate to the current adjusted qualifying balances for accounts then held. The liquidation account balance is not available for payment of dividends, and the Bank may not pay dividends if those dividends would reduce equity capital below the required liquidation account amount.
Pursuant to the Plan of Conversion, the Bank’s Board of Directors adopted an ESOP which purchased in the open market 8% of the common stock originally issued for a total of 1,048,029 shares. As of December 15, 2015, 1,048,029 shares, or 100.0% of the total, had been purchased. As of December 31, 2018, First Northwest had allocated 201,026 shares from the total shares purchased to participants.
First Northwest's business activities generally are limited to passive investment activities and oversight of its investment in First Federal. Accordingly, the information set forth in this report, including the consolidated financial statements and related data, relates primarily to the Bank.
The Bank is a community-oriented financial institution providing commercial and consumer banking services to individuals and businesses in Western Washington State with offices in Clallam, Jefferson, Kitsap, and Whatcom counties. These services include deposit and lending transactions that are supplemented with borrowing and investing activities.
Change in Fiscal Year - The Company's Board of Directors approved a change in the Company's fiscal year end from June 30 to December 31, effective December 31, 2017. As a result of this change, the consolidated financial statements include the Company's financial results for the six month transition period from July 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017. The following tables present certain comparative transition period condensed financial information for both the twelve months ended and six months ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.

Use of estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make assumptions. These assumptions result in estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to a determination of the allowance for loan losses, fair value of financial instruments, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the valuation of impaired loans.

Principles of consolidation - The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of First Northwest Bancorp and its wholly owned subsidiary, First Federal. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Subsequent events - The Company has evaluated subsequent events for potential recognition and disclosure and determined there are no such events or transactions requiring recognition or disclosure.
Cash and cash equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents consist of currency on hand, due from banks, and interest-bearing deposits with financial institutions with an original maturity of three months or less. The amounts on deposit fluctuate and, at times, exceed the insured limit by the FDIC, which potentially subjects First Federal to credit risk. First Federal has not experienced any losses due to balances exceeding FDIC insurance limits.
Restricted assets - Federal Reserve Board regulations require maintenance of certain minimum reserve balances on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. The amount required to be on deposit was approximately $9.1 million, $10.1 million and $8.8 million at December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, respectively. First Federal was in compliance with its reserve requirements at December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017.
Investment securities - Investment securities are classified into one of three categories: (1) held-to-maturity, (2) available-for-sale, or (3) trading. First Federal had no trading securities at December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017. Investment securities are categorized as held-to-maturity when First Federal has the positive intent and ability to hold those securities to maturity.
Securities that are held-to-maturity are stated at cost and adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, which are recognized as adjustments to interest income. 
Investment securities categorized as available for sale are generally held for investment purposes (to maturity), although unanticipated future events may result in the sale of some securities. Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value, with the unrealized holding gain or loss reported in other comprehensive income (OCI), net of tax, as a separate component of shareholders' equity. Realized gains or losses are determined using the amortized cost basis of securities sold using the specific identification method and are included in earnings. Dividend and interest income on investments are recognized when earned. Premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the level yield method over the period to maturity.
The Company reviews investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) on a quarterly basis. For debt securities, the Company considers whether management intends to sell a security or if it is likely that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis of the investment, which may be maturity. For debt securities, if management intends to sell the security or it is likely that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovering its cost basis, the entire impairment loss would be recognized as OTTI and charged against earnings. If management does not intend to sell the security and it is not likely that the Company will be required to sell the security, but management does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security, only the portion of the impairment loss representing credit losses would be recognized in earnings. The credit loss on a security is measured as the difference between the amortized cost basis and the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected. Projected cash flows are discounted by the original or current effective interest rate depending on the nature of the security being measured for potential OTTI. The remaining impairment related to all other factors, i.e. the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and fair value, is recognized as a charge to OCI. Impairment losses related to all other factors are presented as separate categories within OCI. If there is an indication of additional credit losses, the security is re-evaluated according to the procedures described above.
Federal Home Loan Bank stock - First Federal’s investment in Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines (FHLB) stock is carried at cost, which approximates fair value. As a member of the FHLB system, First Federal is required to maintain a 
107

FIRST NORTHWEST BANCORP AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

minimum investment in FHLB stock based on specific percentages of its outstanding mortgages, total assets, or FHLB advances. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, First Federal’s minimum investment requirement was approximately $6.9 million and $7.0 million, respectively. First Federal was in compliance with the FHLB minimum investment requirement at December 31, 2018 and 2017. First Federal may request redemption at par value of any stock in excess of the amount First Federal is required to hold. Stock redemptions are granted at the discretion of the FHLB.
Management evaluates FHLB stock for impairment based on its assessment of the ultimate recoverability of cost rather than by recognizing temporary declines in value. The determination of whether a decline affects the ultimate recoverability of cost is influenced by criteria such as (1) the significance of any decline in net assets of the FHLB compared with the capital stock amount for the FHLB and the length of time this situation has persisted, (2) commitments by the FHLB to make payments required by law or regulation and the level of such payments in relation to the operating performance of the FHLB, (3) the impact of legislative and regulatory changes on institutions and, accordingly, the customer base of the FHLB, and (4) the liquidity position of the FHLB. Based on its evaluation, First Federal did not recognize an OTTI loss on its FHLB stock at December 31, 2018 and 2017.
Loans held for sale - Mortgage loans originated and intended for sale in the secondary market are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value. Fair value is determined based upon market prices from third-party purchasers and brokers. Net unrealized losses, if any, are recognized through a valuation allowance by charges to earnings. Gains or losses on the sale of loans are recognized at the time of sale and determined by the difference between net sale proceeds and the net book value of the loan less the estimated fair value of any retained mortgage servicing rights. 
Loans receivable - Loans are stated at the amount of unpaid principal, net of charge-offs, unearned income, allowance for loan loss (ALLL) and any deferred fees or costs. Interest on loans is calculated using the simple interest method based on the month end balance of the principal amount outstanding and is credited to income as earned. The estimated life is adjusted for prepayments. 
Each loan segment and class inherently contains differing credit risk profiles depending on the unique aspects of that segment or class of loans. For example, borrowers tend to consider their primary residence and access to transportation for employment-related purposes as basic requirements; accordingly, many consumers prioritize making payments on real estate first-mortgage loans and vehicle loans. Conversely, second-mortgage real estate loans or unsecured loans may not be supported by sufficient collateral; thus, in the event of financial hardship, borrowers may tend to place less importance on maintaining these loans as current and the Bank may not have adequate collateral to provide a secondary source of repayment in the event of default. Notwithstanding the various risk profiles unique to each class of loan, management believes that the credit risk for all loans is similarly dependent on essentially the same factors, including the financial strength of the borrower, the cash flow available to service maturing debt obligations, the condition and value of underlying collateral, the financial strength of any guarantors, and other factors.
Loans are classified as impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that First Federal will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due, in accordance with the terms of the original loan agreement. The carrying value of impaired loans is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at each loan’s effective interest rate or, for collateral dependent loans, at fair value of the collateral, less selling costs. If the measurement of each impaired loan’s value is less than the recorded investment in the loan, First Federal recognizes this impairment and adjusts the carrying value of the loan to fair value through the allowance for loan losses. This can be accomplished by charging off the impaired portion of the loan or establishing a specific component to be provided for in the allowance for loan losses.
The accrual of interest on loans is discontinued at the time the loan is 90 days delinquent, unless the credit is well secured and in process of collection. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful.
108

FIRST NORTHWEST BANCORP AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

All interest accrued but not collected for loans that are placed on nonaccrual or charged off is reversed against interest income. The interest on these loans is accounted for on the cash basis or cost recovery method until qualifying for return to accrual. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. For those loans placed on non-accrual status due to payment delinquency, return to accrual status will generally not occur until the borrower demonstrates repayment ability over a period of not less than six months.
Loan fees - Loan origination fees and certain direct origination costs are deferred and amortized as an adjustment to the yield of the loan over the contractual life using the effective interest method. In the event a loan is sold, the remaining deferred loan origination fees and/or costs are recognized as a component of gains or losses on the sale of loans.
Allowance for loan losses - First Federal maintains a general allowance for loan losses based on evaluating known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio, including management’s continuing analysis of the factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio. These factors include changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio, actual loan loss experience, and current and anticipated economic conditions. The reserve is an estimate based upon factors and trends identified by management at the time the financial statements are prepared.
The ultimate recovery of loans is susceptible to future market factors beyond First Federal’s control, which may result in losses or recoveries differing significantly from those provided in the consolidated financial statements. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination processes, periodically review First Federal’s allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require First Federal to recognize additional provisions for loan losses based on their judgment using information available to them at the time of their examination.
Allowances for losses on specific problem loans are charged to income when it is determined that the value of these loans and properties, in the judgment of management, is impaired. First Federal accounts for impaired loans in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 310-10-35, Receivables—Overall—Subsequent Measurement. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that First Federal will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. 
When a loan has been identified as being impaired, the amount of the impairment is measured by using discounted cash flows, except when it is determined that the sole source of repayment for the loan is the operation or liquidation of the underlying collateral. In such cases, impairment is measured at current fair value generally based on a current appraisal of the collateral, reduced by estimated selling costs. When the measurement of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan (including collected interest that has been applied to principal, net deferred loan fees or costs, and unamortized premiums or discounts), loan impairment is recognized by establishing or adjusting an allocation of the allowance for loan losses. Uncollected accrued interest is reversed against interest income. If ultimate collection of principal is in doubt, all cash receipts on impaired loans are applied to reduce the principal balance. The impairment amount for small balance homogeneous loans is calculated using the adjusted historical loss rate for the class and risk category related to each loan, unless the loan is subject to a troubled debt restructuring ("TDR").
A TDR is a loan for which First Federal, for reasons related to the borrower’s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that First Federal would not otherwise consider. The loan terms that have been modified or restructured due to the borrower’s financial difficulty include, but are not limited to, a reduction in the stated interest rate; an extension of the maturity; an interest rate below market; a reduction in the face amount of the debt; a reduction in the accrued interest; or extension, deferral, renewal, or rewrite of the original loan terms.
The restructured loans may be classified “special mention” or “substandard” depending on the severity of the modification. Loans that were paid current at the time of modification may be upgraded in their classification after a sustained period of repayment performance, usually six months or longer, and there is reasonable assurance that repayment will continue. Loans that are past due at the time of modification are classified “substandard” and placed on nonaccrual status.
109

FIRST NORTHWEST BANCORP AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

TDR loans may be upgraded in their classification and placed on accrual status once there is a sustained period of repayment performance, usually six months or longer, and there is a reasonable assurance that repayment will continue. First Federal allows reclassification of a troubled debt restructuring back into the general loan pool (as a non-troubled debt restructuring) if the borrower is able to refinance the loan at then-current market rates and meet all of the underwriting criteria of First Federal required of other borrowers. The refinance must be based on the borrower’s ability to repay the debt and no special concessions of rate and/or term are granted to the borrower.
Reserve for unfunded commitments - Management maintains a reserve for unfunded commitments to absorb probable losses associated with off-balance sheet commitments to lend funds such as unused lines of credit and the undisbursed portion of construction loans. Management determines the adequacy of the reserve based on reviews of individual exposures, current economic conditions, and other relevant factors. The reserve is based on estimates and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates. The reserve is evaluated on a regular basis and necessary adjustments are reported in earnings during the period in which they become known. The reserve for unfunded commitments is included in "Accrued expenses and other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets.
Real estate owned and repossessed assets - Real estate owned and repossessed assets include real estate and personal property acquired through foreclosure or repossession, and may include in-substance foreclosed properties. In-substance foreclosed properties are those properties for which the Bank has taken physical possession, regardless of whether formal foreclosure proceedings have taken place.
Mortgage servicing rights - Originated servicing rights are recorded when mortgage loans are originated and subsequently sold with the servicing rights retained. Servicing assets are initially recognized at fair value with the income statement effect recorded in gains on sales of loans and amortized into non-interest income in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying financial asset. To determine the fair value of servicing rights, management uses a valuation model that calculates the present value of future cash flows. Assumptions used in the valuation model include market discount rates and anticipated prepayment speeds. In addition, estimates of the cost of servicing per loan, an inflation rate, ancillary income per loan, and default rates are used. The initial fair value relating to the servicing rights is capitalized and amortized into noninterest income in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated future net servicing income. 
Management assesses impairment of the mortgage servicing rights based on recalculations of the present value of remaining future cash flows using updated market discount rates and prepayment speeds. Subsequent loan prepayments and changes in prepayment assumptions in excess of those forecasted can adversely impact the carrying value of the servicing rights. Impairment is assessed on a stratified basis with any impairment recognized through a valuation allowance for each impaired stratum. The servicing rights are stratified based on the predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans: fixed-rate loans and adjustable-rate loans. The effect of changes in market interest rates on estimated rates of loan prepayments is the predominant risk characteristic for mortgage servicing rights. The valuation model incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income, such as the cost to service, the discount rate, the custodial earnings rate, an inflation rate, ancillary income, prepayment speeds, and default rates and losses.
Mortgage servicing income represents fees earned for servicing loans. Fees for servicing mortgage loans are generally based upon a percentage of the principal balance of the loans serviced, as well as related ancillary income such as late charges. Servicing income is recognized as earned, unless collection is doubtful. The caption in the consolidated statement of income “Mortgage servicing fees, net” includes mortgage servicing income, amortization of mortgage servicing rights, the effects of mortgage servicing run-off, and impairment, if applicable.
Income taxes - First Federal accounts for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740-10, Income Taxes, which requires the use of the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for their future tax consequences, attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted 
110

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
Premises and equipment - Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recognized and computed on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives as follows:

Buildings | 37.5 - 50 years
Furniture, fixtures, and equipment | 3 - 10 years 
Software | 3 years 
Automobiles | 5 years 

Transfers of financial assets - Transfers of an entire financial asset, a group of financial assets, or a participating interest in an entire financial asset are accounted for as sales when control over the assets has been relinquished. Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when: (1) the assets have been isolated from First Federal, (2) the transferee obtains the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets, and (3) First Federal does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity. The mortgage loans that are sold with recourse provisions are accounted for as sales until such time as the loan defaults.
Periodically, First Federal sells mortgage loans with “life of the loan” recourse provisions, requiring First Federal to repurchase the loan at any time if it defaults. The remaining balance of such loans at December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, was approximately $5.6 million, $5.6 million and $6.5 million, respectively. Of these loans, no loans were repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2018 or six months ended December 31, 2017, and one loan was repurchased in the amount of $100,000 during the year ended June 30, 2017. There is an associated allowance of $19,000, $25,000 and $33,000 at December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, respectively, included in “accrued expenses and other liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheets related to these loans. 
Bank-owned life insurance - The carrying amount of life insurance approximates fair value. Fair value of life insurance is estimated using the cash surrender value, less applicable surrender charges. The change in cash surrender value is included in noninterest income.
Off-balance-sheet credit-related financial instruments - In the ordinary course of business, First Federal has entered into commitments to extend credit, including commitments under lines of credit, commercial letters of credit, and standby letters of credit. Such financial instruments are recorded when they are funded.
Advertising costs - First Federal expenses advertising costs as they are incurred.
Comprehensive income (loss) - Accounting principles generally require that recognized revenue, expenses, and gains and losses be included in net income (loss). Although certain changes in assets and liabilities, such as unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, are reported as a separate component of the equity section of the consolidated balance sheets, such items, along with net income (loss), are components of comprehensive income (loss).
Dividend restriction - Banking regulations require maintaining certain capital levels and may limit the dividends paid by the Bank to the Company or by the Company to shareholders.
Fair value measurements - Fair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions (Note 14). Fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding interest rates, credit risk, prepayments, and other factors, especially in the absence of broad markets for particular items. Changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect these estimates.

Segment information - First Federal is engaged in the business of attracting deposits and providing lending services. Substantially all income is derived from a diverse base of commercial, mortgage, and consumer lending activities and investments. The Company’s activities are considered to be a single industry segment for financial reporting purposes.
Employee Stock Ownership Plan - The cost of shares issued to the ESOP but not yet allocated to participants is shown as a reduction of shareholders' equity. Compensation expense is based on the market price of shares as they are committed to be released to participants' accounts. Dividends on allocated ESOP shares reduce retained earnings while dividends on unearned ESOP shares reduce debt and accrued interest.
Earnings (loss) per Share - Basic earnings (loss) per share ("EPS") is computed by dividing net income or (loss), reduced by earnings allocated to participating shares of restricted stock, by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. As ESOP shares are committed to be released they become outstanding for EPS calculation purposes. ESOP shares not committed to be released are not considered outstanding for basic or diluted EPS calculations. The basic EPS calculation excludes the dilutive effect of all common stock equivalents. Diluted earnings per share reflects the weighted-average potential dilution that could occur if all potentially dilutive securities or other commitments to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock using the treasury stock method.
According to the provisions of ASC 260, Earnings per Share, nonvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities and are included in the computation of EPS pursuant to the two-class method. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each class of common stock and participating security according to dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings. At this time the Company has no share-based payment awards nor paid a dividend.
Recently adopted accounting pronouncements - In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). In August 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which postponed the effective date of 2014-09. Subsequently, in March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations. This amendment clarifies that an entity should determine if it is the principal or the agent for each specified good or service promised in a contract with a customer. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing. The core principle of Topic 606 is that an entity must recognize revenue when it has satisfied a performance obligation of transferring promised goods or services to a customer. In general, the new guidance requires companies to use more judgment and make more estimates than under current guidance, including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. These standards were effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company has analyzed its revenue sources of noninterest income to determine when the satisfaction of the performance obligation occurs and the appropriate recognition of revenue. The adoption of these ASUs did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements as the Company did not identify any significant changes in the timing of revenue recognition when considering the amended accounting guidance since it is consistent with the Company’s current accounting policy for contracts.
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. ASU 2016-01 requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. In addition, the amendments in this ASU require an entity to disclose the fair value of financial instruments using the exit price notion. Exit price is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The amendments in this ASU were effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company has used the exit price notion in the fair value disclosure of financial instruments in Note 14 of this report. The adoption of ASU 2016-01 did not have a material 
112

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements or disclosures in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. The ASU provides specific guidance on eight classification issues in order to achieve more consistent reporting. The amendments in this ASU were effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not currently have items on its cash flow statement that were impacted by adoption of this ASU and therefore adoption of ASU 2016-15 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-08, Receivables-Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20): Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities. The ASU shortens the amortization period for certain callable debt securities held at a premium using the earliest call date. The amendments do not require an accounting change for securities held at a discount; the discount continues to be amortized to maturity. The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2017-08 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting. This ASU provides clarity on the guidance related to stock compensation when there have been changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award to which an entity would be required to apply modification accounting under ASC 718. The ASU provides the three following criteria must be met in order to not account for the effect of the modification of terms or conditions: the fair value, the vesting conditions and the classification as an equity or liability instrument of the modified award is the same as the original award immediately before the original award is modified. The amendments in this ASU were effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company has not had any modifications on share-based payment awards and therefore the adoption of ASU 2017-09 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In March 2018, FASB issued ASU No. 2018-05, Income Taxes (Topic 740). This ASU was issued to provide guidance on the income tax accounting implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and allows for entities to report provisional amounts for specific income tax effects of the Act for which the accounting under Topic 740 was not yet complete but a reasonable estimate could be determined. A measurement period of one-year is allowed to complete the accounting effects under Topic 740 and revise any previous estimates reported. Any provisional amounts or subsequent adjustments included in an entity’s financial statements during the measurement period should be included in income from continuing operations as an adjustment to tax expense in the reporting period the amounts are determined. The Company adopted this ASU with the provisional adjustments as reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements on Form 10-KT as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2018, the Company did not incur any adjustments to the provisional recognition.
Recently issued accounting pronouncements
Lease Accounting
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases. ASU 2016-02 is intended to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements. The principal change required by this ASU relates to lessee accounting, and is that for operating leases, a lessee is required to (1) recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, in the statement of financial position, (2) recognize a single lease cost, calculated so that the cost of the lease is allocated over the lease term on a generally straight-line basis, and (3) classify all cash payments within operating activities in the statement of cash flows. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. If a lessee makes this election, it should recognize lease expense for such leases generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term. ASU 2016-02 also changes disclosure requirements related to leasing activities, and requires certain qualitative disclosures along with specific quantitative disclosures. The amendments in ASU 2016-02 are effective for annual

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early application of the amendments in ASU 2016-02 is permitted. Once adopted, we expect to report higher assets and liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as a result of including right-of-use assets and lease liabilities related to certain banking offices and certain equipment under noncancelable operating lease agreements, which currently are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We do not expect the guidance to have a material impact on the Consolidated Statements of Income or Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders' Equity. ASU 2016-02 initially provided for one retrospective transition method; however a second transition method was later added with ASU 2018-11 which permits companies to utilize certain practical expedients.
In July 2018, FASB issued ASU No. 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases. These amendments provide minor clarifications and corrections to ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).
In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements. The amendments in this ASU provide entities with an additional optional transition method to adopt ASU 2016-02. Under this new transition method, an entity initially applies the new leases standard at the adoption date and recognizes a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. Consequently, an entity’s reporting under this additional transition method for the comparative periods presented in the financial statements in which it adopts the new leases standard would continue to be in accordance with current GAAP (Topic 840, Leases).
The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 (as amended by subsequent ASUs) effective January 1, 2019 utilizing the new transition method described in ASU 2018-11 and availed itself of practical expedients. As a lessee, the Company is party to several office leases for which the Company recorded right-of-use assets and lease liabilities at the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments of $3.9 million upon adoption of ASU 2016-02. As lessee, the Company applied the following practical expedients in the implementation ASU 2016-02: (i) to not separate non-lease components from the associated lease component as described above and (ii) to not apply the right-of-use recognition requirements to short-term leases.
Other Accounting Topics
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Loss, which updates the guidance on recognition and measurement of credit losses for financial assets. The new requirements, known as the current expected credit loss model (CECL) will require entities to adopt an impairment model based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Upon adoption, the Company will change processes and procedures to calculate the allowance for loan losses, including changes in assumptions and estimates to consider expected credit losses over the life of the loan versus the current accounting practice that utilizes the incurred loss model. In addition, the current accounting policy and procedures for other-than-temporary impairment on investment securities available for sale will be replaced with an allowance approach. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the impact the implementation of this ASU will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Company's internal project management team continues to review models, work with our third-party vendor, and discuss changes to processes and procedures to ensure the Company is fully compliant with the amendments at the adoption date.
In August 2017, FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815). This ASU was issued to provide investors better insight to an entity’s risk management hedging strategies by permitting companies to recognize the economic results of its hedging strategies in its financial statements. The amendments in this ASU permit hedge accounting for hedging relationships involving non-financial risk and interest rate risk by removing certain limitations in cash flow and fair value hedging relationships. In addition, the ASU requires an entity to present the earnings effect of the hedging instrument in the same income statement line item in which the earnings effect of the hedged item is reported. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. Adoption of ASU 2017-12 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In June 2018, FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07, Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting. These amendments provide specific guidance for transactions for acquiring

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

goods and services from nonemployees and specify that Topic 718 applies to all share-based payment transactions in which a grantor acquires goods or services to be used or consumed in a grantor’s own operations by issuing share-based payment awards. The amendments also clarify that Topic 718 does not apply to share-based payments used to effectively provide (i) financing to the issuer or (ii) awards granted in conjunction with selling goods or services to customers as part of a contract accounted for under Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted but not earlier than the adoption of Topic 606. The Company does not believe that this guidance will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements as it has not historically issued share-based payments in exchange for goods or services to be consumed within its operations.
In July 2018, FASB issued ASU No. 2018-09, Codification Improvements. These amendments provide clarifications and corrections to certain ASC subtopics including the following: 220-10 (Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Overall), 470-50 (Debt - Modifications and Extinguishments), 480-10 (Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity - Overall), 718-740 (Compensation - Stock Compensation - Income Taxes), 805-740 (Business Combinations - Income Taxes), 815-10 (Derivatives and Hedging - Overall), and 820-10 (Fair Value Measurement - Overall). Some of the amendments in ASU 2018-09 do not require transition guidance and will be effective upon issuance; however, many of the amendments do have transition guidance with effective dates for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently assessing the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.
In August 2018, FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Disclosure Framework — Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement which removes, modifies, and adds certain disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements in ASC 820. This guidance is effective for public companies in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.
In August 2018, FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15 Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract to provide guidance on implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract. The ASU aligns the accounting for such costs with the guidance on capitalizing costs associated with developing or obtaining internal-use software. Specifically, the ASU amends ASC 350 to include in its scope implementation costs of such arrangements that are service contracts and clarifies that a customer should apply ASC 350-40 to determine which implementation costs should be capitalized. This ASU, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.
In October 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-16 Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), Inclusion of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Overnight Index Swap (OIS) Rate as a Benchmark Interest Rate for Hedge Accounting Purposes. The amendments in this ASU permit use of the OIS rate based on SOFR as a U.S. benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes under Topic 815 in addition to the interest rates on direct Treasury obligations of the U.S. government, the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) swap rate, the Overnight Index Swap (OIS) Rate based on the Fed Funds Effective Rate and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) Municipal Swap Rate. The amendments in this ASU are required to be adopted concurrently with the amendments in ASU 2017-12. For public companies, this would be for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently assessing the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.
In August 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a final rule that amends certain of its disclosure requirements. The rule simplifies various disclosure requirements for public companies including primarily that it (i) eliminates the requirement for public companies to disclose in their filings a schedule of earnings to fixed charges, (ii) requires an analysis of changes in stockholders’ equity for the current and comparative year-to-date interim periods in interim reports, and (iii) reduces the requirements for market price information disclosures in annual reports. These changes are effective for public companies beginning on November 5, 2018. The Company anticipates complying with these new requirements beginning with its March 31, 2019 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

The Company may hold certain investment securities in an unrealized loss position that are not considered OTTI. At December 31, 2018, there were 69 investment securities with $6.7 million of unrealized losses and a fair value of approximately $268.5 million. At December 31, 2017, there were 63 investment securities with $3.2 million of unrealized losses and a fair value of approximately $233.2 million. At June 30, 2017, there were 42 investment securities with $1.8 million of unrealized losses and a fair value of approximately $164.9 million.
Management believes that the unrealized losses on investment securities relate principally to the general change in interest rates and illiquidity, and not credit quality, that has occurred since the initial purchase, and such unrecognized losses or gains will continue to vary with general interest rate level fluctuations in the future. Certain investments in a loss position are guaranteed by government entities or government sponsored entities. The Company does not intend to sell the securities in an unrealized loss position and believes it is not likely it will be required to sell these investments prior to a market price recovery or maturity.
There were no OTTI losses during the year ended December 31, 2018, six months ended December 31, 2017, and years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016.

Credit quality indicator - Federal regulations provide for the classification of lower quality loans and other assets, such as debt and equity securities, as substandard, doubtful, or loss; risk ratings 6, 7, and 8 in our 8-point risk rating system, respectively. An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and pay capacity of the borrower or of any collateral pledged. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that First Federal will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values. Assets 
133

FIRST NORTHWEST BANCORP AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted.
When First Federal classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it may establish a specific allowance to address the risk specifically or First Federal may allow the loss to be addressed in the general allowance. General allowances represent loss allowances that have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities but that, unlike specific allowances, have not been specifically allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as a loss, it is required to charge off such assets in the period in which they are deemed uncollectible. Assets that do not currently expose First Federal to sufficient risk to warrant classification as substandard or doubtful but possess identified weaknesses are designated as either watch or special mention assets; risk ratings 4 and 5 in our risk rating system, respectively. Loans not otherwise classified are considered pass graded loans and are rated 1-3 in our risk rating system.
Additionally, First Federal categorizes loans as performing or nonperforming based on payment activity. Loans that are more than 90 days past due and nonaccrual loans are considered nonperforming.

TDR loans may be upgraded in their classification and placed on accrual status once there is a sustained period of repayment performance, usually six months or longer, and there is a reasonable assurance that repayment will continue. First Federal allows reclassification of a troubled debt restructuring back into the general loan pool (as a non-troubled debt restructuring) if the borrower is able to refinance the loan at then-current market rates and meet all of the underwriting criteria of First Federal required of other borrowers. The refinance must be based on the borrower’s ability to repay the debt and no special concessions of rate and/or term are granted to the borrower.

As a result of the bad debt deductions taken in years prior to 1988, retained earnings include accumulated earnings of approximately $6.4 million, on which federal income taxes have not been provided. If, in the future, this portion of retained earnings is used for any purpose other than to absorb losses on loans or on property acquired through foreclosure, federal income taxes may be imposed at the then-prevailing corporate tax rates. The Company does not contemplate that such amounts will be used for any purpose that would create a federal income tax liability; therefore, no provision has been made.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. These calculations are based on many complex factors including estimates of the timing of reversals of temporary differences, the interpretation of federal income tax laws, and a determination of the differences between the tax and the financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ significantly from the estimates and interpretations used in determining the current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities.
During the year ended June 30, 2015, the Company contributed $400,000 in cash and $9.3 million in common stock to the Foundation. Under current Federal income tax regulations, charitable contribution deductions are limited to 10% of taxable

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

income. Accordingly, the $9.7 million contribution created a carryforward for income tax purposes with a deferred tax asset of $3.3 million and related valuation allowance of $1.9 million for financial statement reporting purposes. At December 31, 2018, the balance of the contribution carryforward totaled $7.2 million. The contribution carryforward will expire in 2019. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company evaluates whether its deferred tax assets will be realized and adjusts the amount of its valuation allowance, if necessary. There was a valuation allowance of $1.2 million and $1.2 million, at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, the reduction of which predominantly relates to the change in corporate tax rate.
The Company applies the provisions of FASB ASC 740 that require the application of a more-likely-than-not recognition criterion for the reporting of uncertain tax positions on its financial statements. The Company had no unrecognized tax assets at December 31, 2018 and 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018 and six months ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized no interest and penalties. The Company recognizes interest and penalties in income tax expense. The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations by tax authorities for years ending before June 30, 2015.
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Government enacted the Tax Act. The Tax Act amends the Internal Revenue Code to reduce tax rates and modify policies, credits, and deductions for individuals and businesses. For businesses, the Tax Act reduces the corporate federal tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate. The corporate tax rate reduction was effective January 1, 2018. The Tax Act required a revaluation the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the future impact of lower corporate tax rates and other provisions of the legislation. As a result of the Company’s revaluation, the net deferred tax asset was reduced through an increase to the provision for income taxes. The Company has also elected to change its tax year end from June 30 to December 31 beginning with the six months ended December 31, 2017. As a result of changing the tax year, the Company recorded an increase to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance to account for the loss of six months of taxable income.

Note 10 - Benefit Plans
Multi-employer Pension Plan
The Bank participates in the Pentegra Defined Benefit Plan for Financial Institutions (the Pentegra DB Plan), a tax-qualified defined-benefit pension plan that covered substantially all employees after one year of continuous employment. Pension benefits vested over a period of five years of credited service. The Pentegra DB Plan’s Employer Identification Number is 13-5645888 and the Plan Number is 12004. The Pentegra DB Plan operates as a multi-employer plan for accounting purposes and as a multiple-employer plan under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code. There are no collective bargaining agreements in place that require contributions to the Pentegra DB Plan. The Pentegra Defined Benefit Plan was frozen and no new benefits were allowed as of February 1, 2010.
The Pentegra DB Plan is a single plan under Internal Revenue Code Section 413(c) and, as a result, all of the assets stand behind all of the liabilities. Accordingly, under the Pentegra DB Plan, contributions made by a participating employer may be used to provide benefits to participants of other participating employers.

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan
First Federal also sponsors a nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan for members of the board of directors and eligible officer-level employees. This plan, approved by the Board on February 1, 2012, allows eligible participants to defer and invest a portion of their earnings in a selection of investment options identified in the plan at no expense to First Federal. All deferrals are remitted to Pentegra, the Plan Administrator, and held in a trust. The aggregate balance held in trust at December 31, 2018, was $784,000.
The Company also has agreements with certain key officers that provide for potential payments upon retirement, disability, termination, change in control and death.
401(k) Plan
First Federal maintains a single-employer 401(k) plan. Employees may contribute up to 100% of their pre-tax compensation to the 401(k) plan, subject to regulatory limits. First Federal provides matching funds of 50% limited to the first 6% of salary contributed. First Federal's contributions were $245,000, $110,000, $177,000, and $159,000 during the year ended December 31, 2018, six months ended December 31, 2017, and years ended June 30, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
Employee Stock Ownership Plan
In connection with the mutual to stock conversion, the Company established an ESOP for eligible employees of the Company and the Bank. Employees of the Company who have been credited with at least 1,000 hours of service during a 12-month period are eligible to participate in the ESOP.
Pursuant to the Plan, the ESOP purchased in the open market 8% of the common stock originally issued in the mutual to stock conversion. As of December 31, 2018, 1,048,029 shares, or 100% of the total, have been purchased in the open market at an average price of $12.45 per share with funds borrowed from First Northwest. The Bank will make contributions to the ESOP in amounts necessary to amortize the ESOP loan payable to First Northwest over a period of 20 years, bearing estimated interest at 2.46%.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Shares purchased by the ESOP with the loan proceeds are held in a suspense account and allocated to ESOP participants on a pro rata basis as principal and interest payments are made by the ESOP to the Company. The loan is secured by shares purchased with the loan proceeds and will be repaid by the ESOP with funds from the Bank's discretionary contributions to the ESOP and earnings on the ESOP assets. Annual principal and interest payments of $835,000, $835,000, and $810,000, were made by the ESOP during the years ended December 31, 2018, and June 30, 2017, and 2016, respectively. No payment was made during the six months ended December 31, 2017.
As shares are committed to be released from collateral, the Company reports compensation expense equal to the average daily market prices of the shares and the shares become outstanding for EPS computations. The compensation expense is accrued monthly throughout the year. Dividends on allocated ESOP shares will be recorded as a reduction of retained earnings; dividends on unallocated ESOP shares will be recorded as a reduction of debt and accrued interest.
Compensation expense related to the ESOP for the year ended December 31, 2018, six months ended December 31, 2017,and years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, was $851,000, $436,000, and $763,000 and $677,000, respectively.

Stock-based Compensation
On November 16, 2015, the Company's shareholders approved the First Northwest Bancorp 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (the "EIP"), which provides for the grant of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units to eligible participants. The cost of awards under the EIP generally is based on the fair value of the awards on their grant date. The maximum number of shares that may be utilized for awards under the EIP is 1,834,050. Under the EIP stock options may be granted that, upon exercise, result in the issuance of up to 1,310,036 shares of common stock and up to 524,014 shares of restricted stock may be awarded. Shares of common stock issued under the EIP may be authorized but unissued shares or repurchased shares. During the year ended June 30, 2017, the Company purchased and retired 523,014 shares of common stock to be used for future stock awards.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, 65,000 shares of restricted stock were awarded and no stock options were granted. There were 50,000 shares of restricted stock awarded during the six months ended December 31, 2017, and no stock options were granted. There were 402,500 shares awards during the year ended June 30, 2017, and no stock options were granted. Awarded shares of restricted stock vest over five years from the date of grant as long as the eligible participant remains in service to the Company. The Company recognizes compensation expense for the restricted stock awards based on the fair value of the shares at the award date.
For the year ended December 31, 2018, six months ended December 31, 2017, and years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, total compensation expense for the EIP was $1.1 million, $589,000, $977,000, and $0, respectively.
Included in the above compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2018, six months ended December 31, 2017, and years ended June 30, 2017and 2016, was directors' compensation of $343,000, $174,000, $383,000, and $0, respectively.

Note 11 - Regulatory Capital Requirements
Under Federal regulations, pre-conversion retained earnings are restricted for the protection of pre-conversion depositors.
The Company is a bank holding company under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. Bank holding companies are subject to capital adequacy requirements of the Federal Reserve Board under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and the regulations of the Federal Reserve Board. The Bank is a federally insured institution and thereby is subject to the capital requirements established by the FDIC. The Federal Reserve Board capital requirements generally parallel the FDIC requirements. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company's financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Bank’s assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Bank’s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. Prompt corrective action provisions are not applicable to bank holding companies.
Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table that follows) of total and Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets (as defined in the regulations) and of Tier 1 capital to average assets. 
Effective January 1, 2015 (with some changes transitioned into full effectiveness over two to four years), First Northwest Bancorp and First Federal became subject to capital requirements which created a required ratio for common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital, increased the leverage and Tier 1 capital ratios, changed the risk-weightings of certain assets for purposes of the risk-based capital ratios, created an additional capital conservation buffer over the required capital ratios and changed what qualifies as capital for purposes of meeting these various capital requirements. First Northwest Bancorp and First Federal are required to maintain additional levels of Tier 1 common equity over the minimum risk-based capital levels to avoid limitations on dividends, repurchase shares and paying discretionary bonuses.
The minimum requirements are a ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital ("CET1 capital") to total risk-weighted assets the (“CET1 risk-based ratio”) of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, a total capital ratio of 8.0%, and a leverage ratio of 4.0%.
151

FIRST NORTHWEST BANCORP AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In addition to the capital requirements, there were a number of changes in what constitutes regulatory capital, subject to a certain transition period. These changes include the phasing-out of certain instruments as qualifying capital. The Bank does not have any of these instruments. Mortgage servicing and deferred tax assets over designated percentages of CET1 are deducted from capital, subject to a transition period ending December 31, 2017. CET1 consists of Tier 1 capital less all capital components that are not considered common equity. In addition, Tier 1 capital includes accumulated other comprehensive income, which includes all unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities, subject to a transition period ending December 31, 2017. Because of the Bank’s asset size, the Bank is not considered an advanced approaches banking organization and has elected to permanently opt-out of the inclusion of unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities in its capital calculations.
The requirements also include changes in the risk-weighting of assets to better reflect credit risk and other risk exposure. These include a 150% risk weight (up from 100%) for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans and for non-residential mortgage loans that are 90 days past due or otherwise in nonaccrual status; a 20% (up from 0%) credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable; and a 250% risk weight (up from 100%) for mortgage servicing and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital.
In order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses based on percentages of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions, First Northwest Bancorp and First Federal must maintain CET1 capital at an amount greater than the required minimum levels plus a capital conservation buffer. This new capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in starting in January 2016 requiring a buffer of 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented to an amount of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets in January 2019. As of December 31, 2018, the conservation buffer was 1.875%.
Under the new standards, in order to be considered well-capitalized, the Bank must maintain a CET1 risk-based ratio of 6.5% (new), a Tier 1 risk-based ratio of 8% (increased from 6%), a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% (unchanged) and a leverage ratio of 5% (unchanged).
As of December 31, 2018, the most recent regulatory notifications categorized First Federal as “well capitalized” under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as “well capitalized,” the Bank must maintain minimum total risk-based, CET1 risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based, and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the following table. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed First Federal’s category.
At periodic intervals, banking regulators routinely examine First Northwest and First Federal as part of their legally prescribed oversight of the banking industry. A future examination could include a review of certain transactions or other amounts reported in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Based on these examinations, the regulators can direct that the Company's consolidated financial statements be adjusted in accordance with their findings. In view of the uncertain regulatory environment in which First Northwest and First Federal operate, the extent, if any, to which a forthcoming regulatory examination may ultimately result in adjustments to the accompanying consolidated financial statements cannot presently be determined.
At December 31, 2018, First Federal exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. Effective with the September 30, 2018 as-of-date, First Northwest Bancorp was transitioned back to the small bank holding company filing requirements which do not require capital ratios to be reported.
Actual and required capital amounts and ratios are presented in the following table:

Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies
First Federal is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments generally represent a commitment to extend credit in the form of loans. The instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets.
First Federal’s exposure to credit loss, in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit, is represented by the contractual notional amount of those instruments. First Federal uses the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments. Management does not anticipate any material loss as a result of these transactions.
Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established by the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. First Federal evaluates each customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. First Federal did not incur any significant losses on its commitments for the year ended December 31, 2018, six months ended December 31, 2017, and year ended June 30, 2017.
The following financial instruments were outstanding whose contract amounts represent credit risk at:

Commitments to grant loans | $ | 625 | | | $ | 543 | | $ | 670

Unfunded commitments under lines of credit or existing loans | 98,847 | | | 99,416 | | | 67,800

Legal contingencies - Various legal claims may arise from time to time in the normal course of business, which, in the opinion of management, have no current material effect on First Federal’s consolidated financial statements.
Significant group concentrations of credit risk - Concentration of credit risk is the risk associated with a lack of diversification, such as having substantial loan concentrations in a specific type of loan within First Federal’s loan portfolio, thereby exposing First Federal to greater risks resulting from adverse economic, political, regulatory, geographic, industrial, or credit developments. Loans to one borrower are subject to the state banking regulations general limitation of 20 percent of First Federal’s equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017 First Federal’s most significant concentration of credit risk was in loans secured by real estate. These loans totaled approximately $767.6 million, $742.9 million and $697.5 million, or 88.3%, 94.5%, and 95.0%, of First Federal’s total loan portfolio at December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, respectively. Real estate construction, including land acquisition and land development, commercial real estate, multi-family, home equity, and one- to four-family residential loans are included in the total loans secured by real estate for purposes of this calculation. After a period of decline the real estate market has begun to recover, which has helped stabilize nonperforming loans and the allowance for loan losses.
At December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, First Federal’s most significant investment concentration of credit risk was with the U.S. Government, its agencies, and Government-Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs). First Federal’s exposure, which results from positions in securities issued by the U.S. Government, its agencies, and securities guaranteed by 
155

FIRST NORTHWEST BANCORP AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

GSEs, was $243.4 million, $256.8 million, and $238.7 million or 77.7%, 73.9%, and 83.8%, of First Federal’s total investment portfolio (including FHLB stock) at December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and June 30, 2017, respectively.
Note 14 - Fair Value Accounting and Measurement
Fair value is the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the Company’s principal market. The Company has established and documented its process for determining the fair values of its assets and liabilities, where applicable. Fair value is based on quoted market prices, when available, for identical or similar assets or liabilities. In the absence of quoted market prices, management determines the fair value of the Company’s assets and liabilities using valuation models or third-party pricing services, both of which rely on market-based parameters when available, such as interest rate yield curves, option volatilities and credit spreads, or unobservable inputs. Unobservable inputs may be based on management’s judgment, assumptions, and estimates related to credit quality, liquidity, interest rates, and other relevant inputs.
Any changes to valuation methodologies are reviewed by management to ensure they are relevant and justified. Valuation methodologies are refined as more market-based data becomes available.
A three-level valuation hierarchy is used in determining fair value that is based on the transparency of the inputs used in the valuation process. The inputs used in determining fair value in each of the three levels of the hierarchy are as follows:
Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 - Either: (i) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; (ii) observable inputs, such as interest rates or yield curves; or (iii) inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs.
The hierarchy gives the highest ranking to Level 1 inputs and the lowest ranking to Level 3 inputs. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the overall fair value measurement.
Qualitative disclosures of valuation techniques - Securities available for sale: where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified as Level 1. Level 1 instruments include highly liquid government bonds, securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, and exchange-traded equity securities. 
If quoted prices are not available, management determines fair value using pricing models, quoted prices of similar securities, which are considered Level 2, or discounted cash flows. In certain cases, where there is limited activity in the market for a particular instrument, assumptions must be made to determine their fair value. Such instruments are classified as Level 3.

Assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis - Assets are considered to be fair valued on a nonrecurring basis if the fair value measurement of the instrument does not necessarily result in a change in the amount recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. Generally, nonrecurring valuation is the result of the application of other accounting pronouncements that require assets or liabilities to be assessed for impairment or recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. 
The following tables present the Company’s assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at the dates indicated:

Note 15 - Earnings per Share
Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the entity.
The following table presents a reconciliation of the components used to compute basic and diluted earnings per share for the periods shown.

 | For the Year Ended | | For the Six Months Ended | | For the Years Ended June 30,

Diluted earnings | $ | 0.68 | | | $ | 0.16 | | $ | 0.46 | $ | 0.33 

Potential dilutive shares are excluded from the computation of EPS if their effect is anti-dilutive. For the year ended December 31, 2018, anti-dilutive shares outstanding related to restricted stock awards totaled 48,040 because the incremental shares under the treasury stock method of calculation resulted in them being anti-dilutive. For the six months ended December 31, 2017, and the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, there were no anti-dilutive shares outstanding related to restricted stock awards.
As of December 15, 2015, the ESOP had purchased 1,048,029 shares of First Northwest Bancorp in the open market. Unallocated ESOP shares are not included as outstanding shares for basic or diluted earnings per share calculations.

(1) Not within scope of Topic 606 | 

The Company recognizes revenue as it is earned and noted no impact to its revenue recognition policies as a result of the adoption of ASU 2014-09. The following is a discussion of key revenues within the scope of the new revenue guidance.
Deposit fees - The Company earns fees from its deposit customers for account maintenance, transaction-based activity and overdraft services. Account maintenance fees consist primarily of account fees and analyzed account fees charged on deposit accounts on a monthly basis. The performance obligation is satisfied and the fees are recognized on a monthly basis as the service period is completed. Transaction-based fees on deposit accounts are charged to deposit customers for specific services provided to the customer, such as non-sufficient funds fees, overdraft fees, and wire fees. The performance obligation is completed as the transaction occurs and the fees are recognized at the time each specific service is provided to the customer.
Debit interchange income - Debit and Automated Teller Machine ("ATM") interchange income represent fees earned when a debit card issued by the Company is used. The Company earns interchange fees from debit cardholder transactions through card networks. In addition, the Company earns interchange fees for use of its ATM by customers of other banking institutions. Interchange fees are based on purchase volumes and other factors and are recognized as transactions occur. The performance obligation is satisfied and the fees are earned when the cost of the transaction is charged to the cardholder's debit card. Certain expenses directly associated with the credit and debit card are netted against interchange income.
Credit card interchange income- Credit card interchange income represents fees earned when a credit card issued by the Bank through a third-party vendor is used. Similar to the debit card interchange, the Bank earns an interchange fee for each transaction made with a Bank-branded credit card. The performance obligation is satisfied and the fees are earned when the cost of the transaction is charged to the cardholder's credit card. Certain expenses directly related to the credit card interchange contract are netted against interchange income.

Investment services revenue - Commissions received on the sale of investment related products is determined by a percentage of underlying instruments sold and is recognized when the sale is finalized.
Gains/losses on the sale of other real estate owned are included in non-interest expense and are generally recognized when the performance obligation is complete. This is typically at delivery of control over the property to the buyer at time of each real estate closing.
