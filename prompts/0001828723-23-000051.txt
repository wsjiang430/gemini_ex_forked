Item 1. Business
Each of the terms “Altus,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” “us,” and similar terms used herein refer collectively to Altus Power Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated.
Company Overview
We are a developer, owner and operator of large-scale roof, ground and carport-based photovoltaic ("PV") and energy storage systems, serving commercial and industrial, public sector and community solar customers. Our mission is to create a clean electrification ecosystem and drive the clean energy transition of our customers across the United States while simultaneously enabling the adoption of corporate environmental, social and governance, or ESG, targets. In order to achieve our mission, we develop, own and operate solar generation and energy storage facilities. We believe we have the in-house expertise to develop, build and provide operations and maintenance and customer servicing for our assets. The strength of our platform is enabled by premier sponsorship from The Blackstone Group ("Blackstone"), which provides an efficient capital source and access to a network of portfolio companies, and CBRE Group, Inc. ("CBRE"), which provides direct access to its portfolio of owned and managed commercial and industrial (“C&I”) properties.
We own systems across the United States from Hawaii to Vermont. Our portfolio consists of 470 megawatts (“MW”) of solar PV. We have long-term power purchase agreements ("PPAs") with over 300 C&I entities and contracts with over 5,000 residential customers which are serviced by approximately 40 megawatts of community solar projects currently in operation. We have agreements to install over 70 additional megawatts of community solar projects, all of which are in advanced stages of development. Our community solar projects are currently servicing customers in 5 states with projects in two additional states currently under construction. We also participate in numerous renewable energy credit (“REC”) programs throughout the country. We have experienced significant growth in the last 12 months as a product of organic growth and targeted acquisitions and currently operate in 22 states, providing clean electricity to our customers equal to the electricity consumption of approximately 60,000 homes, displacing 320,000 tons of CO emissions per annum.
Through our strategic capital deployment, we are able to build and operate clean energy systems on commercial properties, schools and municipal buildings. The electricity we generate helps customers to reduce electricity bills, progress towards decarbonization targets and support resource management needs throughout the asset lifecycles. Our primary product offering is entering into leases or easements with building or landowners and revenue contracts to sell the power generated by the solar energy system to various commercial, utility, municipal and community solar off takers. In addition to sale of clean power, we also address our customer's needs through electric vehicle ("EV") charging and energy storage offerings.
Our offering provides multiple advantages to our customers relative to the status quo:
•Lower electricity bills. Our streamlined process allows for solar energy credits to apply directly to customers' utility bills, which allows them to realize immediate savings. In addition, our PPAs are typically priced to include a day one savings as compared to the existing utility rates.
•Increase accessibility of clean electricity. Through our use of community solar, we provide clean electricity to customers who otherwise would not have been able to construct on-site solar, such as apartment and condominium customers. This increases the total addressable market and enables energy security for all.
•Supporting clean energy ecosystem. Demand for clean sources of electricity is anticipated only to increase. We strive to support our customers in their continued transition to the clean energy ecosystem through our solar PV and storage systems, as well as our EV charging stations. We expect that our continued growth and expansion of product offerings will allow us to support even more customers in this transition.
We own all of our solar systems, which we build and install, with equipment sourced from a wide variety of suppliers. We purchase all major components of the systems we construct, including solar modules, inverters, racking systems, transformers, medium voltage equipment, monitoring equipment and balance of system equipment. All of the labor for the construction of these systems is subcontracted under our standard contracts. 
We believe our robust and actionable pipeline is the result of our deep network of developers and channel partners with local expertise, which is beneficial in the many markets where we are active. Our wholly-owned in-house construction company provides expertise in asset development that aids the success of our pipeline projects. Further, we believe that our ability to source favorable development and operating solar projects, our strategic asset financing structure, combined with the demand for clean energy provide us with a competitive advantage and a unique position in the solar power industry.
Merger with CBRE Acquisition Holdings, Inc.
On December 9, 2021 (the "Closing Date"), CBRE Acquisition Holdings, Inc. ("CBAH"), a special purpose acquisition company, consummated the business combination pursuant to the terms of the business combination agreement entered into on July 12, 2021 (the "Business Combination Agreement"), whereby, among other things, CBAH Merger Sub I, Inc. ("First Merger 
Sub") merged with and into Altus Power, Inc. (f/k/a Altus Power America, Inc.) ("Legacy Altus") with Legacy Altus continuing as the surviving corporation, and immediately thereafter Legacy Altus merged with and into CBAH Merger Sub II, Inc. ("Second Merger Sub") with Second Merger Sub continuing as the surviving entity and as a wholly owned subsidiary of CBAH (together with the merger with the First Merger sub, the “Merger”).
Following the closing of the Business Combination Agreement, Altus' Class A common stock and Public Warrants were listed on the NYSE under the symbols “AMPS” and “AMPS WS”, respectively. The Public Warrants have been fully redeemed by the Company, stopped trading on the NYSE on October 14, 2022, and were delisted.
Total Addressable Market
Electricity demand has been evolving for many years, but the progress has accelerated with the renewable targets and decarbonization goals established by many corporations transitioning to clean electricity generation. The demand is coming from multiple industry segments, including the public sector, the private sector and residential customers. Historically, the C&I market has been under-penetrated by traditional utility-scale solar PV providers due to the smaller scale of projects and difficulties associated with scaling nationally. We believe we are well equipped to drive the C&I growth segment of the solar PV market through our existing national partner footprint, efficient acquisition and deployment strategies and standardized approach to customer contracts and asset financing.
We believe the confluence of multiple clean energy trends creates a significant market opportunity. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”), the U.S. spends $400 billion on electricity each year, of which $200 billion is spent on C&I. An additional $98 billion of investment will be required to meet the U.S.’s 2030 sustainability goals. Further, C&I customers are projected to spend over $6 trillion on electricity between now and 2050. 
We believe it will be necessary to rapidly increase the scale and scope of renewable generation assets in the U.S. in order to meet the various targets and commitments set by corporations and governments and that through our strategic partnerships and market-leading financing, Altus is well equipped to help meet this demand and lead in the clean energy transition.
Commitment to Environmental, Social and Governance Leadership
Altus Power was founded to address the urgent need to transform the way we generate and consume power. Our mission – to create a clean electrification ecosystem that can provide renewable energy to every business, home and electric vehicle – is intrinsically linked to clean, renewable power as the foundation for a sustainable future. 
We believe that leadership in environmental, social and governance ("ESG") practices is central to accomplishing our mission, so we continue to take steps to address the environmental and social risks of our operations and products. To this end, we have established a Corporate Social Responsibility Committee that is dedicated to implementing and improving upon already existing sustainability practices throughout our company. Our team is passionate about empowering communities and businesses to accelerate the global energy transition while also doing everything we can to foster a diverse, inclusive and innovative corporate culture at Altus Power. 
Our sustainability efforts are organized into the three ESG pillars: Environment, Social, and Governance. We plan to report how we oversee and manage ESG factors in an annual sustainability report. In this report we plan to reference the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards. 
•Our Environment Pillar focuses on providing clean, affordable energy to our customers; maintaining a robust environmental management program that ensures we protect the environment in the communities where we operate and build; and helping to make our energy infrastructure more resilient and sustainable. 
•Our Social Pillar focuses on attracting and retaining a team of talented individuals, while offering opportunities for growth and development; building a diverse and inclusive work force; and ensuring a safety-first workplace for our employees through proper training, policies and protocols.
•Our Governance Pillar focuses on adhering to the highest standards of corporate governance, ethical business conduct, transparency, honesty, and integrity while developing a strong and resilient company. We strive to support ethically sourced products and materials and encourage the partners in our supply-chain to abide by our Supplier Code of Conduct. 
All of our actions and each of our ESG pillars are underpinned by the goal of driving the clean energy transition of our customers across the United States.
Our Digital Platform
Altus leverages best in class enterprise software solutions to manage our operations as well as a series of proprietary capture and management tools. Altus utilizes this suite of tools and interfaces to create value for customers with asset 
performance tracking, analytics, real time data generation and to meet our forecast objectives. Altus' analytics infrastructure provides it with internally developed systems for optimizing the terms of each renewable energy project transaction in which it engages, based on the requirements of the customer. To assist customers with their ESG goals including decarbonization, Altus has developed a quantitative model to measure a building's greenhouse gas emissions and assess it in the context of global targets.
Altus is in the process of developing our next generation proprietary software stack to support our growth and increase our efficiency with digital tools that will enable our platforms to have full integration into our B2B and B2C lifecycles from origination through maintenance. Our systems use production data sources to ensure visibility into how projects are performing against baseline forecasts. They also provide streamlined asset registration and customer data management. We warehouse our technology and project data, contracts, and customer records and have the alert and monitoring systems developed to ensure we have maximum uptime. Our next generation proprietary software stack with AI/ML will support our growth and security, and increase our efficiency.
Sales and Marketing
We sell our solar energy offerings through a scalable sales organization using a national developer base with local expertise, intermediaries that connect clients directly to Altus as well as our diverse partner network. We also generate sales volume through client referrals. Client referrals increase in relation to our penetration in a market and shortly after market entry become an increasingly effective way to market our solar energy systems. We believe that a customized, relationship-focused selling process is important before, during and after the sale of our solar services to maximize our sales success and customer experience and to generate relationships with developers that lead to repeat projects. We train our sales and marketing team in house to maximize this multi-pronged client development strategy.
Supply Chain
We purchase equipment, including solar panels, inverters and batteries from a variety of manufacturers and suppliers. If one or more of the suppliers and manufacturers that we rely upon to meet anticipated demand reduces or ceases production, it may be difficult to quickly identify and qualify alternatives on acceptable terms. In addition, equipment prices may increase in the coming years, or not decrease at the rates we historically have experienced, due to tariffs or other factors. For further information, please see the section entitled “Risk Factors” elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Intellectual Property
We have registered trademarks for “Altus Power” and the Altus Power logo, U.S. Service Mark Registration Numbers 6,764,603 and 6,751,205, respectively. We have filed a trademark application for "Village by Altus Power," U.S. Trademark Application No. 97/748,067. We have filed a patent application for the Simulation of Carbon Emissions, United States Patent Application No. 18/128,096. Altus has registered domain names, including www.altuspower.com. Information contained on or accessible through the website is not a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and the inclusion of the website address in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is an inactive textual reference only. Altus does not currently have any issued patents. Altus has filed for a patent application on the "Simulation of Carbon Emissions" and intends to file additional patent applications as we continue to innovate through our research and development efforts.
Regulatory
Although we are not regulated as a public utility in the United States under applicable national, state or other local regulatory regimes where we conduct business, we compete primarily with regulated utilities. As a result, we have developed and are committed to maintaining a policy team to focus on the key regulatory and legislative issues impacting the entire industry. We believe these efforts help us better navigate local markets through relationships with key stakeholders and facilitate a deep understanding of the national and regional policy environment.
To operate our systems, we obtain interconnection permission from the applicable local primary electric utility. Depending on the size of the solar energy system and local law requirements, interconnection permission is provided by the local utility directly to us and/or our customers. In almost all cases, interconnection permissions are issued on the basis of a standard process that has been pre-approved by the local public utility commission or other regulatory body with jurisdiction over net metering policies. As such, no additional regulatory approvals are required once interconnection permission is given.
Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws, including regulations governing the occupational health and safety of our employees and wage regulations. For example, we are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended (“OSH Act”), and comparable state laws that protect and regulate employee health and safety. We endeavor to maintain compliance with applicable OSH Act and other comparable government regulations.
Government Incentives
Federal, state and local government bodies provide incentives to owners, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of solar energy systems to promote solar energy in the form of rebates, tax credits, payments for RECs associated with renewable energy generation and exclusion of solar energy systems from property tax assessments. These incentives enable us to lower the price we charge customers for energy from, and to lease, our solar energy systems, helping to catalyze customer acceptance of solar energy as an alternative to utility-provided power. In addition, for some investors, the acceleration of depreciation creates a valuable tax benefit that reduces the overall cost of the solar energy system and increases the return on investment.
The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”), which was passed in August 2022, substantially changed and expanded existing federal tax benefits for renewable energy. The IRA extended the existing framework for investment tax credits (“ITC”) offered by the federal government under Section 48(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") for the installation of certain solar power facilities owned for business purposes. Prior to the IRA, if construction on the facility began before January 1, 2020, the amount of the ITC available was 30%, if construction began during 2020, 2021, or 2022 the amount of the ITC available was 26%, with additional step downs in later years. Projects placed in service before January 1, 2022 are still set at 26%. However, with the enactment of the IRA, solar power facilities installed between 2022 and 2032 will receive a 30% ITC of the cost of installed equipment for ten years so long as the facilities meet wage and apprenticeship requirements or are less than 1 MWac, which will decrease to 26% for solar power facilities installed in 2033 and to 22% for solar power facilities installed in 2034; and for those solar power facilities installed in 2022, the ITC has increased from 22% to 30% if the ITC has not yet been claimed. The prevailing wage rates also must be paid for alteration and repair during the 5 years after a project is placed in service.
Pursuant to the IRA, certain ITC projects are eligible for a 10% domestic content bonus so long as the facilities meet wage and apprenticeship requirements, if all the steel and iron are produced in the United States and at least 40% of the facility is produced in the United States, which domestic content percentage requirement increases for facilities that start construction after 2024 and eventually reach 55% for projects which begin construction in 2027 or later.
Pursuant to the IRA, certain ITC projects are eligible for an additional 10% or 20% energy community bonus so long as the facilities meet wage and apprenticeship requirements, and if the facility owner applies for and receives an environmental justice allocation from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”). Solar (and certain related storage) facilities that are less than 5 MWac that are either located in a low-income community or on Indian land, or are part of a qualified low-income residential building project or a qualified low-income economic benefit project qualify. For example, qualified low-income economic benefit projects can receive a 20% bonus if low-income households receive at least one-half of the financial benefits. The IRS provided taxpayers guidance in Notice 2023-18 for determining the requirements for allocation of the ITC bonus. The IRA also included additional incentives, including in relation to stand-alone storage and claiming interconnection costs under the ITC in certain situations.
In addition to the incentives at the federal government, more than half of the states, and many local jurisdictions, have established property tax incentives for renewable energy systems that include exemptions, exclusions, abatements and credits. Approximately thirty states and the District of Columbia have adopted a renewable portfolio standard (and approximately eight other states have some voluntary goal) that requires regulated utilities to procure a specified percentage of total electricity delivered in the state from eligible renewable energy sources, such as solar energy systems, by a specified date. To prove compliance with such mandates, utilities must surrender solar renewable energy credits (“SRECs”) to the applicable authority. Solar energy system owners such as our investment funds often are able to sell SRECs to utilities directly or in SREC markets. While there are numerous federal, state and local government incentives that benefit our business, some adverse interpretations or determinations of new and existing laws can have a negative impact on our business.
