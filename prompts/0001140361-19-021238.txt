 (In millions of dollars, except as otherwise noted)

General

Berry Global Group, Inc. (“Berry,” “we,” or the “Company”) is a leading global supplier of a broad range of innovative rigid, flexible and non-woven products used every day within consumer and industrial end markets.  We sell our products predominantly into stable, consumer-oriented end markets, such as healthcare, personal care, and food and beverage.  Our customers consist of a diverse mix of leading global, national, mid-sized regional and local specialty businesses. The size and scope of our customer network allows us to introduce new products we develop or acquire to a vast audience that is familiar with our business.  For the fiscal year ended September 28, 2019 (“fiscal 2019”), no single customer represented more than 5% of net sales and our top ten customers represented approximately 20% of net sales.  We believe our manufacturing processes, manufacturing footprint and our ability to leverage our scale to reduce costs, positions us as a low-cost manufacturer relative to our competitors.

In July 2019, upon completion of the RPC Group Plc ("RPC") acquisition, the Company reorganized into four reporting segments: Consumer Packaging International, Consumer Packaging North America, Engineered Materials and Health, Hygiene & Specialties.  The new structure is designed to align us with our customers, provide improved service, drive future growth, and to facilitate future cost saving synergies. The Company has recast all prior period amounts to conform to this new reporting structure.

Additional financial information about our segments is provided in “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” which are included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

Marketing, Sales, and Competition

We reach our large and diversified customer base through a direct sales force of dedicated professionals and the strategic use of distributors.  Our sales, production and support staff meet with customers to understand their needs and improve our product offerings and services.  Our scale enables us to dedicate certain sales and marketing efforts to particular products or customers, when applicable, which enables us to develop expertise that we believe is valued by our customers.  In addition, because we serve common customers across segments, we have the ability to efficiently utilize our sales and marketing resources to minimize costs.

The major markets in which the Company sells its products are highly competitive.  Areas of competition include service, innovation, quality, and price.  This competition is significant as to both the size and the number of competing firms.  Competitors include but are not limited to Amcor, Silgan, Aptar, Reynolds, Intertape, 3M, Tredegar, Avgol, and Fitesa.

Raw Materials

Our primary raw material is plastic resin.  In addition, we use other materials such as butyl rubber, adhesives, paper and packaging materials, linerboard, rayon, polyester fiber, and foil, in various manufacturing processes.  These raw materials are available from multiple sources and in general we purchase from a variety of global suppliers.  However, in certain regions we may source specific raw materials from a limited number of suppliers or on a sole-source basis.  While temporary shortages of raw materials can occur, we expect to continue to successfully manage raw material supplies without significant supply interruptions.
Employees

As of the end of fiscal year 2019, we employed approximately 48,000 employees with approximately 20% of those employees being covered by collective bargaining agreements.  The collective bargaining agreements covering a majority of these employees expire annually and as a result, are due for renegotiation in fiscal 2020.  Our relations with employees under collective bargaining agreements remain satisfactory and there have been no significant work stoppages or other labor disputes during the past three years.
Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property

We customarily seek patent and trademark protection for our products and brands while seeking to protect our proprietary know-how.  While important to our business in the aggregate, sales of any one individually patented product is not considered material to any specific segment or the consolidated results.
Environmental Matters and Government Regulation

Our past and present operations and ownership of real property are subject to extensive and changing federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, handling and disposition of waste, and cleanup of contaminated soil and ground water, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. However, we cannot predict with any certainty that we will not incur liability with respect to noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations, contamination of sites formerly or currently owned or operated by us (including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites) or the off-site disposal of regulated materials, which could be material. We may from time to time be required to conduct remediation of releases of regulated materials at our owned or operated facilities. None of our pending remediation projects are expected to result in material costs.

 
The packaging industry, including us, is subject to existing and potential federal, state, local and foreign legislation designed to reduce solid waste by requiring, among other things, products to be degradable in landfills, minimum levels of recycled content, various recycling requirements, disposal fees, and new taxation and limitations on the use of various products. Certain jurisdictions require packaged products to comply with standards intended to encourage recycling and increased use of recycled materials. In addition, various consumer and special interest groups have lobbied from time to time for the implementation of these and other similar measures. We believe that the legislation promulgated to date and such initiatives to date have not had a material adverse effect on us.  There can be no assurance that any such future legislative or regulatory efforts or future initiatives would not have a material adverse effect on us.
