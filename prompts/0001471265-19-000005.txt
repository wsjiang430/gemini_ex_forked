Market Area and Competition

We are headquartered in northwestern Pennsylvania and have expanded primarily through acquisitions, into the southwestern and central regions of Pennsylvania, as well as western New York and northeastern Ohio.  As of December 31, 2018, we operated 114 community banking locations in Pennsylvania, 22 community banking offices in Ohio and 36 community banking offices in New York.  All of the aforementioned market areas are served by a number of competing financial institutions. As a result, we encounter strong competition both in attracting deposits and in originating loans. Our most direct competition for deposits comes from other banks, brokerage houses and credit unions in our market areas.  We expect continued competition from these financial institutions in the foreseeable future. With the continued acceptance of internet banking by our customers and consumers generally, competition for deposits has increased from institutions operating outside of our market area as well as from insurance companies.

Lending Activities

General.  Our principal lending activities are the origination of fixed and adjustable-rate loans collateralized by one-to four-family residential real estate, shorter term consumer loans and loans collateralized by multi-family residential and commercial real estate as well as commercial business loans. Generally, we focus our lending activities in the geographic areas where we maintain offices.

In an effort to manage interest rate risk, we have sought to make our interest-earning assets more interest rate sensitive by originating adjustable-rate loans, such as adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit, and by originating short-term and medium-term fixed-rate consumer loans. In recent years we have emphasized the origination of commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans, which generally have adjustable-rates of interest and shorter maturities 
3

than one-to four-family residential real estate loans. Because we originate a substantial amount of long-term fixed-rate mortgage loans collateralized by one-to four-family residential real estate, when possible, we originate and underwrite loans according to standards that allow us to sell them into the secondary mortgage market for purposes of managing interest-rate risk and liquidity.  The sale of mortgage loans supports our strategy to grow the consumer and commercial loan portfolios faster than our portfolio of long-term fixed-rate residential mortgage loans. We currently sell low-yielding fixed-rate residential mortgage loans with maturities of more than 15 years, and on a more limited basis, those with maturities of 15 years or less, while retaining all adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans. Although we sell a portion of the residential mortgage loans that we originate, we continue to be a portfolio lender, and at any one time hold relatively few loans identified as held-for-sale.  We currently retain servicing on the mortgage loans we sell which generates monthly service fee income.  We generally retain in our portfolio all consumer loans that we originate while we periodically sell participations in the multi-family residential, commercial real estate or commercial business loans that we originate in an effort to reduce the concentration of certain individual credits and the risk associated with certain businesses, industries or geographies.

Residential Mortgage Loans.  We offer residential mortgage loans with terms typically ranging from 15 to 30 years, with either fixed or adjustable interest rates. Our mortgage loans are amortized on a monthly basis with both principal and interest due monthly. Originations of fixed-rate residential mortgage loans versus adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans are monitored on an ongoing basis. The percentage of adjustable-rate residential mortgage originations to total originations is affected significantly by the level of market interest rates, customer preference, our interest rate sensitivity and liquidity position, as well as loan products offered by our competitors. Therefore, even when our strategy is to increase the origination of adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans, market conditions may be such that there is greater demand for fixed-rate mortgage loans. Adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans totaled $43.0 million, or 0.5%, of our gross loan portfolio at December 31, 2018.

Our fixed-rate residential mortgage loan products offer fixed-rates for up to 30 years. Whenever possible, our fixed-rate residential mortgages are originated and underwritten according to secondary mortgage market guidelines in order to manage credit risk, as well as interest rate risk and liquidity risk. Our adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans offer initial interest rate adjustment periods of one, three, and five years, terms up to 30 years and adjustments based on changes in designated market indices. 

Regulations limit the amount that a savings bank may lend relative to appraised values of real estate securing the loans, as determined by an appraisal at the time of loan origination. Such regulations permit a maximum loan-to-value of 95% for residential properties and 80% for all other real estate secured loans. We generally limit the maximum loan-to-value on both fixed- and adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans without private mortgage insurance, to 80% of the lesser of appraised values or purchase prices of real estate serving as collateral for our mortgage loans.  Limited special financing programs allow for insured loans with loan-to-value ratios of up to 97%, and uninsured loans with loan-to-value ratios up to 90%. The appraisal process is managed by Northwest Appraisal Services, and appraisals are performed by in-house appraiser staff or by appraisers deemed qualified by our chief appraiser. We require fire and casualty insurance, as well as a title guaranty regarding good title, on all properties securing our residential mortgage loans. We also require flood insurance for loans secured by properties located within special flood hazard areas.

Included in our $2.864 billion portfolio of residential mortgage loans are construction loans of $18.0 million, or 0.2% of our gross loan portfolio.  We offer fixed-rate and adjustable-rate residential construction-to-permanent loans primarily for the construction of owner-occupied one-to four-family residences in our market area to builders or owners who have a contract for construction.  Construction loans are originated with terms of up to 30 years with an allowance of up to one year for construction.  Advances are made as construction is completed, and interest is charged on the total amount of credit extended.  At the end of the construction period, repayment terms convert to fully amortizing payments, with both principal and interest due monthly. Construction lending generally involves a greater degree of credit risk than permanent residential mortgage lending, as repayment of construction loans is often dependent upon the successful completion of construction projects.  Construction delays or the inability of borrowers to sell properties once construction is completed may impair borrowers’ ability to repay loans.  Private mortgage insurance is required for construction loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of 80%, and the maximum loan-to-value ratio for construction loans is 95% of the lower of cost to build or as-completed appraised value.
In addition, we originate loans within our market area that are secured by individual unimproved or improved lots.  Land loans for the construction of owner-occupied residential real estate properties are currently offered with fixed-rates for terms of up to ten years.  The maximum loan-to-value ratio for these loans is 80% of the as-completed appraised value.

Our residential mortgage loans customarily include due-on-sale clauses, which are provisions giving us the right to declare loans immediately due and payable in the event, among other things, borrowers sell or otherwise dispose of underlying real properties serving as collateral for loans.

4

Home Equity Loans.  Generally, our home equity loans are secured by the borrower’s principal residence with a maximum loan-to-value ratio, including the principal balances of both the first and second mortgage loans, of 90% or less. We generally underwrite home equity loans and lines of credit in a manner similar to our underwriting of residential mortgage loans. 
Home equity loans are offered on a fixed-rate basis with amortized terms of up to 20 years. Principal and interest is due monthly.  At December 31, 2018, our fixed-rate home equity loans totaled $710.4 million, or 8.8% of gross loans. 
Home equity lines of credit are offered on an adjustable-rate basis with terms of up to 30 years, including draw and repayment periods of up to 15 years each. Although home equity lines of credit require interest-only payments during draw periods, they are underwritten using amortizing principal and interest payments based on current rates of equivalent fixed-rate products. The disbursed portion of home equity lines of credit totaled $548.0 million, or 6.8% of gross loans, with $660.0 million remaining undisbursed as of December 31, 2018.
Other Consumer Loans.  The principal types of other consumer loans we offer are direct and indirect automobile loans, sales finance loans, unsecured personal loans, credit card loans, and loans secured by deposit accounts. These loans are typically offered with maturities of ten years or less.

The underwriting standards we employ for consumer loans include a determination of the applicant’s credit history and an assessment of ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. The stability of the applicant’s monthly income may be determined by verification of gross monthly income from primary employment, and additionally, from any verifiable secondary income. Creditworthiness of the applicant is of primary consideration; however, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral in relation to the proposed loan amount.

Consumer loans entail greater credit risk than residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or secured by assets that depreciate rapidly, such as automobiles, mobile homes, boats, recreation vehicles, appliances and furniture. In such cases, repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan and the remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower. In particular, amounts realizable on the sale of repossessed automobiles may be significantly reduced based upon the condition of the automobiles and the lack of demand for used automobiles.  At December 31, 2018, other consumer loans totaled $837.9 million, or 10.2% of gross loans.
Commercial Real Estate Loans.  Our multi-family commercial real estate loans are secured by multi-family residences, such as rental properties. Our commercial real estate loans are secured by nonresidential properties such as hotels, commercial offices, medical buildings, manufacturing facilities and retail establishments. At December 31, 2018, a significant portion of our multi-family commercial real estate and commercial real estate loans were secured by properties located within our market area. Our largest multi-family commercial real estate loan relationship at December 31, 2018 had a principal balance of $24.1 million. This loan was performing in accordance with its terms as of December 31, 2018. Our largest commercial real estate loan relationship at December 31, 2018 had a principal balance of $94.4 million and was secured by 25 commercial real estate properties including hotels, retail, office, and self-storage. These loans were performing in accordance with their terms as of December 31, 2018. Multi-family commercial and commercial real estate loans are offered with both adjustable and fixed interest rates. The terms of each multi-family residential and commercial real estate loan are negotiated on a case-by-case basis. We generally originate multi-family commercial and commercial real estate loans in amounts up to 80% of the appraised value of the property collateralizing the loan.

Loans secured by multi-family commercial and commercial real estate generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than residential mortgage loans and carry larger loan balances. This increased credit risk is a result of several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the effects of general economic conditions on income producing properties, and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans. Furthermore, the repayment of loans secured by multi-family commercial and commercial real estate is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the related real estate property. If the cash flow from the project is reduced, the borrower’s ability to repay the loan may be impaired.

Commercial Loans.  We offer commercial loans to finance various activities in our market area, some of which are secured in part by additional real estate collateral. At December 31, 2018, our largest commercial loan relationship had a principal balance of $34.6 million, and was secured with business assets. This loan was performing in accordance with its terms as of December 31, 2018.

Commercial business loans are offered with both fixed and adjustable interest rates. Underwriting standards we employ for commercial business loans include a determination of the applicant’s ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan from operating cash flows generated by the applicant’s business. The financial strength of each applicant is also assessed through a review of financial statements provided by the applicant.

We originate commercial loans through our network of Small Business and Commercial Loan Officers located in our areas. In addition, our Commercial Finance group originates loans where multiple banks may be involved in the credit facilities. These loans are made to companies operating in our market area. Many of these companies carry public debt ratings. 
Commercial loans generally have higher interest rates than residential loans, but they also may involve a higher risk of default since their repayment is generally dependent on the successful operation of the borrower’s business.  We strive to obtain personal guarantees from the borrower or a third party as a condition to originating commercial loans.

Loan Originations, Solicitation, Processing and Commitments.  Upon receiving a retail loan application, we obtain a credit report and employment verification to verify specific information relating to the applicant’s employment, income, and credit standing.  In the case of a real estate loan, either an in-house appraiser, or an approved external appraiser, appraises the real estate intended to secure the proposed loan. A loan processor checks the loan document file for accuracy and completeness, and verifies the information provided.

For our personal loans, including residential mortgage loans, home equity loans and lines of credit, automobile loans, credit cards and other unsecured loans, we have implemented a credit approval process based on a laddered individual loan authority system. Real estate secured loans are underwritten centrally by our licensed mortgage loan originators. Non-real estate loans are underwritten by local loan officers who are granted various levels of authority based on their lending experience and expertise.  These authority levels are reviewed by the Credit Committee on at least an annual basis.

Aggregate credit exposures over $750,000 are underwritten by Credit Administration. Our commercial loan policy assigns individual lending limits for our various commercial loan officers and dual authority consisting of an individual from Commercial Lending and Credit Administration. Lending authorities are established by the Credit Committee. The Senior Loan Committee may approve extensions of credit in excess of the maximum dual authority. The Credit Committee meets quarterly to review the assigned lending limits and to monitor our lending policies, loan activity, economic conditions and concentrations of credit.
Our general policy is to make no loans either individually or in the aggregate to one customer in excess of $30.0 million.  Under certain circumstances, for instance well-qualified customers or customers with multiple individually qualified projects, this limit may be exceeded subject to the approval of the Senior Loan Committee. Loans exceeding $5.0 million or unusual loan requests are reviewed with the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors at each quarterly meeting.  In addition, the Chief Credit Officer has the authority to require that the Board of Directors review any loan that has been approved by the Senior Loan Committee with which the Chief Credit Officer has specific concerns. Fire and casualty insurance is required at the time the loan is made and throughout the term of the loan, and flood insurance is required as determined by regulation.  After a loan is approved, a loan commitment letter is promptly issued to the borrower.  At December 31, 2018, we had commitments to originate $136.8 million of loans.

The commitment letter specifies the terms and conditions of the proposed loan including the amount, interest rate, amortization period, maturity, a description of the required collateral and required insurance coverage. Property searches are requested, as needed, on all loans secured by real property.

Loan Origination Fees.  We defer loan origination fees received from borrowers and costs to originate loans and amortize such amounts as an adjustment of yield over the life of the loan by using the level yield method. Deferred loan fees and costs are recognized as part of interest income immediately upon prepayment or the sale of the related loan. At December 31, 2018, we had $27.8 million of net deferred loan origination fees. Loan origination fees vary with the volume and type of loans and commitments originated and purchased, principal repayments, and competitive conditions in the marketplace.

Income from net loan origination fees was $11.2 million, $11.6 million and $11.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Loans-to-One Borrower.  As of December 31, 2018, the largest aggregate amount loaned to one borrower, or related borrowers, totaled $94.4 million and was secured by 25 commercial real estate properties including hotels, retail, office multi-family and self-storage. Our second largest lending relationship totaled $82.4 million and was secured by 12 commercial real estate properties including student housing, medical office, senior housing, office, industrial and retail. Our third largest lending relationship totaled $43.9 million and was primarily secured with commercial real estate properties including multi-family and office. Our fourth largest lending relationship totaled $41.6 million and was partially secured with office properties. Our fifth largest lending relationship totaled $41.5 million and was secured two commercial real estate properties including student housing and retail . All of these loans were performing in accordance with their terms at December 31, 2018.

Investment Activities

Our Board of Directors has primary responsibility for establishing and overseeing our investment policy. The Board of Directors has delegated authority to implement the investment policy to our Chief Financial Officer. The investment policy is reviewed at least annually, and any changes to the policy are subject to approval by the Board of Directors.  The overall objectives of the investment policy are to maintain a portfolio of high quality and diversified investments, to provide liquidity, and to control interest rate risk while providing an acceptable return. The investment portfolio is also used to provide collateral for qualified deposits and borrowings, to provide additional earnings when loan production is low, and to reduce our tax liability. The policy dictates that investment decisions give consideration to the safety of principal, liquidity requirements and potential returns. All purchase and sale transactions are reported to the Board of Directors on a monthly basis.

Our investment policy does not permit the purchase of complex securities and derivatives as defined in federal banking regulations and other high-risk securities, nor does it permit additional investments in non-agency mortgage-backed securities, pooled trust preferred securities, or single issuer trust preferred securities.

At the time of purchase, we designate a security as either held-to-maturity or available-for-sale based upon our ability and intentions.  Securities available-for-sale are carried at fair value and securities held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost.  A periodic review and evaluation of the available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities portfolios is conducted to determine if the fair value of any security has declined below its carrying value and whether such decline is other-than-temporary.  If impairment exists, credit related impairment losses are recorded in earnings while noncredit related impairment losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (for available-for-sale securities).  The fair values of our securities are based on published or securities dealers’ market values, when available.  See note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed analysis and description of our investment portfolio and valuation techniques.

We purchase debentures and mortgage-backed securities that generally are issued by the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB"), Fannie Mae ("FNMA"), Freddie Mac ("FHLMC") or Ginnie Mae ("GNMA").  Historically, we have invested in mortgage-backed securities to achieve positive interest rate spreads with minimal administrative expense and to lower our credit risk as a result of the guarantees provided by FHLMC, FNMA or GNMA.  
Sources of Funds

General. Deposits are the primary funding source for lending and other investing purposes. In addition to deposits, we derive funds from the amortization, prepayment and sale of loans and mortgage-backed securities, the maturity of investment securities, operations and, if needed, borrowings. Scheduled loan principal repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments and sales are influenced significantly by general interest rates and market conditions. Borrowings may be used on a short-term basis to compensate for reductions in the availability of funds from other sources or on a longer term basis for general business purposes, including to manage interest rate risk.

Deposits. Personal and business deposits are generated from our market area by offering a broad selection of deposit instruments including checking accounts, savings accounts, money market deposit accounts, term certificate accounts and individual retirement accounts. While we accept deposits of $250,000 or more, we do not offer premium rates for such deposits. We accept brokered deposits through the CDARS program, but generally do not solicit funds outside our market area.  As of December 31, 2018, we had deposits through the CDARS program with an aggregate balance of $3.6 million. Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the period of time during which the funds must remain on deposit, and the interest rate, among other factors. We regularly execute changes in our deposit rates based upon general market interest rates, competition, and liquidity requirements.

Borrowings. We may utilize borrowings to supplement our supply of lendable funds and to meet deposit withdrawal requirements. Borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh typically are collateralized by a portion of our real estate loans. In addition to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh, we have borrowing facilities with the Federal Reserve Bank, two correspondent banks and we borrow funds, in the form of corporate repurchase agreements, from municipalities, corporations and school districts.

The Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh functions as a central bank providing credit for Northwest Bank and other member financial institutions.  As a member, Northwest Bank is required to own capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh and is authorized to apply for borrowings on the security of certain of its real estate loans, provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met.  Borrowings are made pursuant to several different programs.  Each credit program has its own interest rate and range of maturities.  Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of borrowings are based either on a fixed percentage of a member institution’s net worth or on the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh’s assessment of the institution’s creditworthiness.

Federal regulations require insured institutions to provide 30 days advance notice to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) before establishing or acquiring a subsidiary or conducting a new activity in a subsidiary.  The insured institution must also provide the FDIC such information as may be required by applicable regulations and must conduct the activity in accordance with the rules and orders of the FDIC. In addition to other enforcement and supervision powers, the FDIC may determine after notice and opportunity for a hearing that the continuation of a savings bank’s ownership of or relation to a subsidiary constitutes a serious risk to the safety, soundness or stability of the savings bank, or is inconsistent with the purposes of federal banking laws.  Upon the making of such a determination, the FDIC may order the savings bank to divest the subsidiary or take other actions.

Personnel

As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,997 full-time and 261 part-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining group. We believe we have a good working relationship with our employees.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
General
As a savings and loan holding company, we are required to comply with the rules and regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board”), and are also required to file certain reports with and are subject to examination by the Federal Reserve Board. We are also subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws.
Northwest Bank is a Pennsylvania-chartered stock savings bank and our deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund (the "DIF"). Northwest Bank is subject to extensive regulation by the Department of Banking and Securities of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (the “Department of Banking”), as its chartering agency, and by the FDIC, as the insurer of its deposit accounts. Northwest Bank must file reports with the Department of Banking and the FDIC concerning its activities and financial condition in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions including acquisitions of other financial institutions. Northwest Bank is examined periodically by the Department of Banking and the FDIC to test Northwest Bank’s compliance with various laws and regulations. This regulation and supervision, as well as federal and state law, establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which Northwest Bank may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the DIF and depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and with their examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Any change in these laws or regulations, whether by the Department of Banking or the FDIC, could have a material adverse impact on the Company, Northwest Bank and their respective operations. Additionally, when the consolidated assets of a financial institution and its holding company exceed $10 billion, the financial institution becomes subject to additional statutory and regulatory requirements that will result in additional costs. This includes enhanced risk management and corporate governance processes, stress-testing based on scenarios specified by the federal regulatory agencies and examination for compliance with federal financial consumer protection laws by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rather than the FDIC. As of December 31, 2018, our consolidated assets were $9.608 billion.
Set forth below is a brief description of certain regulatory requirements that are applicable to Northwest Bank and Northwest Bancshares, Inc. The description below is limited to certain material aspects of the statutes and regulations addressed, and is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on Northwest Bank and Northwest Bancshares, Inc.
Pennsylvania Savings Bank Law
The Pennsylvania Banking Code of 1965, as amended (the “Banking Code”) contains detailed provisions governing the organization, operations, corporate powers, savings and investment authority, branching rights and responsibilities of directors, officers and employees of Pennsylvania savings banks. A Pennsylvania savings bank may locate or change the location of its principal place of business and establish an office anywhere in, or adjacent to, Pennsylvania, with the prior approval of the Department of Banking. The Banking Code delegates extensive rulemaking power and administrative discretion to the Department of Banking in its supervision and regulation of state-chartered savings banks.
Although the Department of Banking may accept the examinations and reports of the FDIC in lieu of its own examination, the current practice is for the Department of Banking to conduct joint examinations with the FDIC. The Department of Banking may order any savings bank to discontinue any violation of law or unsafe or unsound business practice and may direct any director, officer, or employee of a savings bank engaged in a violation of law, unsafe or unsound practice or breach of fiduciary duty to show cause at a hearing before the Department of Banking why such person should not be removed. The Department of Banking may also appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution in appropriate cases.
The “Banking Law Modernization Package” was Pennsylvania legislation effective in 2012. The legislation was intended to update, simplify and modernize the banking laws of Pennsylvania and reduce regulatory burden where possible. The legislation, among other things, increased the threshold for investments in bank premises without Department of Banking approval from 25% of capital, surplus, undivided profits and capital securities to 100%, eliminated certain lending requirements and pricing restrictions and changed the procedure for a Pennsylvania state chartered institution to close a branch from an application for approval to a notice. The legislation also clarified the Department of Banking’s examination and enforcement authority over subsidiaries of Pennsylvania institutions and authorized the assessment of civil money penalties of up to $25,000 under certain circumstances for violations of laws or orders related to the institution or unsafe or unsound practices or breaches of fiduciary duties.

Federal Deposit Insurance
The FDIC currently maintains the Deposit Insurance Fund ("DIF"), which was created in 2006 through the merger of the Bank Insurance Fund and the Savings Association Insurance Fund.  The deposit accounts of our subsidiary bank are insured by the DIF to the maximum amount provided by law.  This insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government.
As insurer, the FDIC is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by DIF-insured institutions.  It also may prohibit any DIF-insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the DIF.  The FDIC also has the authority to take enforcement actions against insured institutions.
The FDIC charges insured depository institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund. Under the FDIC’s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions were assigned a risk category based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors. An institution’s rate depended upon the category to which it is assigned, and certain adjustments specified by FDIC regulations. Institutions deemed less risky pay lower FDIC assessments. 
Assessments for most institutions are now based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of failure within three years. In conjunction with the Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio achieving 1.15%, the assessment range was reduced for most banks and savings associations of less than $10 billion in total assets to 1.5 basis points from 30 basis points (inclusive of possible adjustments), effective July 1, 2016. The Dodd-Frank Act specifies that banks with greater than $10 billion in assets be required to bear the burden of raising the reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%. Such institutions are subject to an annual surcharge of 4.5 basis points of total assets exceeding $10 billion. This surcharge will remain in place until the earlier of the Deposit Insurance Fund reaching the 1.35% ratio or December 31, 2018, at which point a shortfall assessment would be applied. The FDIC indicated that the 1.35% ratio was exceeded in November 2018. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the 1.5% maximum fund ratio, instead leaving it to the discretion of the FDIC, and the FDIC has exercised that discretion by establishing a long-range fund ratio of 2%. 
In addition, all institutions with deposits insured by the FDIC are required to pay assessments to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, a mixed-ownership government corporation established to recapitalize a predecessor to the Deposit Insurance Fund.  These assessments will continue until the Financing Corporation bonds mature in the third quarter of 2019.
Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC or written agreement entered into with the FDIC. The management of the Bank does not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance.
Capital Requirements
Federal regulations require federally insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets of 8.0%, and a 4.0% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. 
In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. In assessing an institution’s capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where deemed necessary.

Any institution that fails any of the regulatory capital requirements is subject to enforcement action by the FDIC. Such action may include a capital directive, a cease and desist order, civil money penalties, restrictions on an institution’s operations, termination of federal deposit insurance, and the appointment of a conservator or receiver. Such action, through enforcement proceedings or otherwise, may require a variety of corrective measures. The regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. 
The following table shows the Basel III regulatory capital levels that must be maintained to avoid limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments, effective January 1, 2019. 
 
 | January 1,
 | 2019 
Common equity Tier 1 ratio plus capital conservation buffer | 7.000 | %
Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio plus capital conservation buffer | 8.500 | %
Total risk-based capital ratio plus capital conservation buffer | 10.500 | %


Northwest Bank is also subject to capital guidelines of the Department of Banking. Although not adopted in regulation form, the Department of Banking requires 6% leverage capital and 10% risk-based capital. The components of leverage and risk-based capital are substantially the same as those defined by the FDIC.
Prompt Corrective Action
Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulators take “prompt corrective action” with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For this purpose, the law establishes five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. Under applicable regulations, an institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater. An institution is “adequately capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5% or greater. An institution is “undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 4.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution is deemed to be “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 3.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is considered to be “critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%. Institutions that fall into an “undercapitalized” category are subject to a variety of mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions, including a restriction on capital distributions and the requirement to file a capital restoration plan with the regulators. Performance under the capital restoration plan must be guaranteed by the parent holding company up to the lesser of the amount of the capital deficiency when deemed undercapitalized or 5% of the institution’s total assets. Federal regulations also specify circumstances under which a federal banking agency may reclassify a well capitalized institution as adequately capitalized, and may require an adequately capitalized institution to comply with supervisory actions as if it were in the next lower category (except that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may not reclassify a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized). As of December 31, 2018, Northwest Bank was “well-capitalized” for this purpose.
Loans-to-One Borrower Limitation
In accordance with the Banking Code, a Pennsylvania chartered savings bank, with certain limited exceptions, may lend to a single or related group of borrowers on an “unsecured” basis an amount equal to 15% of its capital accounts, the aggregate of capital, surplus, undivided profits, capital securities and reserve for loan losses. The Credit Committee has established an internal lending limit, either individually or in the aggregate to one customer, of $20.0 million. Under certain circumstances, for instance well qualified customers or customers with multiple individually qualified projects, this limit may be exceeded subject to the approval of the Senior Loan Committee. As of December 31, 2018 we had 23 credit relationships that equal or exceed our $20.0 million internal limit. 
Activities and Investments of Insured State-Chartered Banks
Federal law generally limits the activities and equity investments of state-chartered banks insured by the FDIC to those that are permissible for national banks. Under regulations dealing with equity investments, an insured state bank generally may 
11

not, directly or indirectly, acquire or retain any equity investment of a type, or in an amount, that is not permissible for a national bank. An insured state bank is not prohibited from, among other things: (i) acquiring or retaining a majority interest in a subsidiary; (ii) investing as a limited partner in a partnership the sole purpose of which is direct or indirect investment in the acquisition, rehabilitation, or new construction of a qualified housing project, provided that such limited partnership investments may not exceed 2% of the bank’s total assets; (iii) acquiring up to 10% of the voting stock of a company that solely provides or reinsures liability insurance for directors, trustees or officers, or blanket bond group insurance coverage for insured depository institutions; and (iv) acquiring or retaining the voting shares of a depository institution if certain requirements are met. Activities of state banks and their subsidiaries are generally limited to those permissible for national banks. Exceptions include where the bank meets applicable regulatory capital requirements and the FDIC determines that the proposed activity does not pose a significant risk to the deposit insurance fund.
The USA PATRIOT Act
The USA Patriot Act gives the federal government powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. The USA Patriot Act also requires the federal banking agencies to take into consideration the effectiveness of controls designed to combat money-laundering activities in determining whether to approve a merger or other acquisition application of a member institution. Accordingly, if we engage in a merger or other acquisition, our controls designed to combat money laundering would be considered as part of the application process. We have established policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations.
Holding Company Regulation
General. Federal law allows a state savings bank, such as Northwest Bank, to elect to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act of 1933, as amended, provided that it qualifies as a “Qualified Thrift Lender.” Such election results in its holding company being regulated as a savings and loan holding company by the Federal Reserve Board rather than as a bank holding company. Northwest Bank has made such an election. Therefore, Northwest Bancshares, Inc. is a savings and loan holding company within the meaning of the Home Owners’ Loan Act of 1933, as amended. As such, we are registered as a savings and loan holding company with the Federal Reserve Board and are subject to Federal Reserve Board regulations, examinations, supervision and reporting requirements. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over the Company and any non-savings institution subsidiaries of the Company. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary savings institution.
Permissible Activities. The business activities of Northwest Bancshares, Inc. are generally limited to those activities permissible for financial holding companies under Section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, or for multiple savings and loan holding companies. A financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature, including underwriting equity securities and insurance as well as activities that are incidental to financial activities or complementary to financial activities. The Dodd-Frank Act and Federal Reserve Board regulations specify that a savings and loan holding company may only engage in financial holding company activities if it meets the qualitative criteria necessary for a bank holding company to engage in such activities and files an election with the Federal Reserve Board. Northwest Bancshares, Inc. has not chosen to be regulated as a financial holding company up to this time. A multiple savings and loan holding company is generally limited to activities permissible for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act, subject to the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board, and certain additional activities authorized by Federal Reserve Board regulations.
Federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company, including Northwest Bancshares, Inc., directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries, from acquiring more than 5% of another savings institution or holding company thereof, without prior written approval of the Federal Reserve Board. It also prohibits, with certain exceptions, the acquisition or retention of more than 5% of a non-subsidiary company engaged in activities that are not closely related to banking or financial in nature, or acquiring or retaining control of an institution that is not federally insured. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions, the Federal Reserve Board must consider, among other factors, the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the federal deposit insurance fund, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors.
The Federal Reserve Board is prohibited from approving any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings institutions in more than one state, subject to two exceptions:

(i) | the approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies; and


(ii) | the acquisition of a savings institution in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings institution specifically permit such acquisition.

12

The states vary in the extent to which they permit interstate savings and loan holding company acquisitions.
Qualified Thrift Lender Test. To be regulated as a savings and loan holding company (rather than as a bank holding company), Northwest Bank must qualify as a Qualified Thrift Lender. To qualify as a Qualified Thrift Lender, Northwest Bank must be a “domestic building and loan association,” as defined in the Internal Revenue Code, or comply with the Qualified Thrift Lender test. Under the Qualified Thrift Lender test, a savings institution is required to maintain at least 65% of its “portfolio assets” (total assets less: (1) specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets; (2) intangibles, including goodwill; and (3) the value of property used to conduct business) in certain “qualified thrift investments” (primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including certain mortgage-backed and related securities) in at least nine months out of each 12-month period. As of December 31, 2018, Northwest Bank met the Qualified Thrift Lender test.
Capital Requirements. Savings and loan holding companies have not historically been subjected to consolidated regulatory capital requirements. However, the Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to establish, for all depository institution holding companies, minimum consolidated capital levels that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries. The previously discussed final rule regarding regulatory capital requirements implements the Dodd-Frank Act as to savings and loan holding companies. Consolidated regulatory capital requirements identical to those applicable to the subsidiary depository institutions apply to savings and loan holding companies (of greater than $3 billion in consolidated assets). As is the case with institutions themselves, the capital conservation buffer was phased in between 2016 and 2019.
Source of Strength/Capital Distributions. The Dodd-Frank Act extended to savings and loan holding companies the Federal Reserve Board’s “source of strength” doctrine, which has long applied to bank holding companies. The Federal Reserve Board has promulgated regulations implementing the “source of strength” policy, which requires holding companies to act as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress.
The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding capital distributions by bank holding companies that it has made applicable to savings and loan holding companies as well. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary depository institution becomes undercapitalized. Regulatory guidance provides for prior regulatory consultation with respect to dividends in certain circumstances, such as where the company’s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company’s overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company’s capital needs and overall financial condition. The guidance similarly provides for regulatory review of stock repurchases or redemptions under certain circumstances. These regulatory policies could affect our ability to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions, including stock repurchases.
As a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, Northwest Bank must notify the Federal Reserve Board thirty days before declaring any dividend to the Company. The dividend notice may be objected to under certain circumstances, such as where the dividend raises safety or soundness concerns, the dividend would cause the savings bank to be undercapitalized or the dividend would violate a law, regulation, regulatory condition or enforcement order.
Federal Securities Laws
Our common stock is registered with the SEC under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). We are also subject to the proxy rules, tender offer rules, insider trading restrictions, annual and periodic reporting, and other requirements of the Exchange Act.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was enacted to increase corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies, and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act generally applies to all companies that file or are required to file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
As directed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are required to certify that our quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact. The rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have several requirements, including having these officers certify that: they are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of our internal control over financial 
13

reporting; they have made certain disclosures to our auditors and the audit committee of the board of directors about our internal control over financial reporting; and they have included information in our quarterly and annual reports about their evaluation and whether there have been changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could materially affect internal control over financial reporting.
FEDERAL AND STATE TAXATION

Federal Taxation.  For federal income tax purposes, Northwest Bancshares, Inc. files a consolidated federal income tax return with its wholly-owned subsidiaries on a calendar year basis. The applicable federal income tax expense or benefit is properly allocated to each subsidiary based upon taxable income or loss calculated on a separate company basis.

We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method which accounts for deferred income taxes by applying the enacted statutory rates in effect at the balance sheet date to differences between the book basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities.  The resulting deferred tax liabilities and assets are adjusted to reflect changes in tax laws.
On December 22, 2017, H.R.1, commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”), was signed into law. The Act includes many provisions that will affect our income tax expense, including reducing our federal tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% effective January 1, 2018. As a result of the rate reduction, we are required to re-measure, through income tax expense in the period of enactment, our deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted rate at which we expect them to be recovered or settled. The re-measurement of our net deferred tax liability resulted in a 2017 income tax benefit of $3.1 million.
State Taxation.  As a Maryland business corporation, Northwest Bancshares, Inc. is required to file annual tax returns with the State of Maryland.  In addition, Northwest Bancshares, Inc. is subject to Pennsylvania’s corporate net income tax.  Dividends received from Northwest Bank qualify for a 100% dividends received deduction and are not subject to corporate net income tax.

Northwest Bank is subject to Pennsylvania’s mutual thrift institutions tax based on Northwest Bank’s net income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, with certain adjustments.  The tax rate under the mutual thrift institutions tax is 11.5%.  Interest on Pennsylvania and federal obligations is excluded from net income.  An allocable portion of interest expense incurred to carry the tax-free obligations is disallowed as a deduction.  Northwest Bank is also subject to taxes in the other states in which it conducts business.  These taxes are apportioned based upon the volume of business conducted in those states as a percentage of the whole.  Because a majority of Northwest Bank’s affairs are conducted in Pennsylvania, taxes paid to other states are not material.

The subsidiaries of Northwest Bank are subject to a Pennsylvania corporate net income tax and are also subject to other applicable taxes in the states where they conduct business.
