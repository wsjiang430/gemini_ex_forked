Overview
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel medicines to address serious medical conditions for individuals who need new or better treatment options. We are focusing our product development efforts in the field of hemostasis (the process that regulates bleeding) and have a mission to develop valuable therapies for individuals with hemophilia. We used a scientific approach to engineer several protease-based therapeutic candidates that regulate blood clotting.
 Our most advanced program, a subcutaneously administered, next-generation engineered coagulation Factor VIIa, marzeptacog alfa (activated) (“MarzAA”), has completed enrollment of the Phase 2 portion of a Phase 2/3 subcutaneous dosing trial in individuals with hemophilia with an inhibitor. The Phase 2 open-label subcutaneous efficacy portion was designed to evaluate the ability of MarzAA to eliminate, or minimize, spontaneous bleeding episodes in individuals with hemophilia A or B with inhibitors and was initiated in December 2017. The trial has completed enrollment of 11 individuals with hemophilia and an inhibitor across six clinical trial sites globally. MarzAA has also successfully completed an intravenous Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and coagulation activity in individuals with severe hemophilia A and B with and without an inhibitor. We will also initiate a subcutaneous Phase 1 pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics study in the second quarter of 2019 and expect the study to conclude in the fourth quarter of 2019. MarzAA has been granted orphan drug designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for routine prophylaxis to prevent bleeding episodes in individuals with hemophilia A or B with inhibitors. 
 As of February 8, 2019, 11 subjects were enrolled with a mean annualized bleed rate (“ABR”) of 18.2; range of 12.2-26.7. One subject revoked consent after single intravenous and subcutaneous doses. Two subjects were dosing. Of the seven subjects that have completed dosing, all had clinically significant reductions in ABR. Five subjects had completed the study with no bleeding at 30 µg/kg and two subjects with no bleeding at 60 µg/kg. One subject with severe hypertension experienced a fatal serious adverse event that was not related to study drug on day 11. 
 Pharmacokinetics analysis has shown that MarzAA’s intravenous half-life of 3.9 hours increased to 13.1 hours when dosed subcutaneously. No anti-drug antibodies to MarzAA or thrombotic events have been detected to date, and only a single moderately severe injection site reaction has been reported after more than 450 injections. We expect to complete the Phase 2 open-label subcutaneous efficacy trial in the second half of 2019 and plan to conduct a global Phase 3 clinical study in 2020 assessing reductions in ABR in 20-40 patients with hemophilia with pre-dosing observation and six months of daily subcutaneous dosing of MarzAA.
 Our next most advanced hemophilia program, a next-generation engineered coagulation Factor IX, Dalcinonacog alfa (“DalcA”) (formerly CB 2679d/ISU304), has completed a Phase 1/2 subcutaneous dosing trial in South Korea, that evaluated the safety and efficacy of DalcA in individuals with severe hemophilia B, sponsored by our collaborator, ISU Abxis. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of increasing Factor IX activity trough levels from ~1% (severe hemophilia) to >12% (mild hemophilia with a reduced chance of spontaneous joint bleeds) with daily subcutaneous injections. DalcA has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA and orphan medicinal product designation by the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (“COMP”) of the European Commission (“EC”).  ISU Abxis initiated this trial in June 2017 and top line data was presented on February 9, 2018. Following the positive data from the multi-dose cohort 5, the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (“MFDS”) approved the addition of a sixth cohort to the Phase 1/2 trial of DalcA in individuals with severe hemophilia B in April 2018.  Cohort 6 enrolled two previously treated subjects from cohort 5. Both subjects had a nadir of 20% activity level after an initial IV dose and following 9 days of daily subcutaneous dosing reached greater than 30% activity before being reduced by neutralizing antibodies (nAb), one of which was transient. Both nAbs waned over time and did not cross react with their wildtype FIX treatments to which they returned without issue. We completed a comprehensive investigation of the cause of the nAb in December 2018 and concluded that the immunogenic potential of DalcA was low and similar to that of commercial FIX products. Based on the results of the investigations and discussions with clinicians and regulatory experts, we concluded that we should continue development of DalcA. We plan to initiate a Phase 2b trial that will include 28 days of daily subcutaneous dosing in six subjects in the first quarter of 2019 and we expect the Phase 2b trial to be completed in the second half of 2019. Based on the efficacy data that we have previously shown in which subjects achieved high mild hemophilia FIX activity, we believe that DalcA has the potential to provide a conveniently-dosed subcutaneous prophylactic treatment option for those suffering from hemophilia B.

The enhanced potency of MarzAA and DalcA compared with existing treatment options may allow for effective subcutaneous prophylactic treatment of individuals with hemophilia A or B with an inhibitor or individuals with hemophilia B, respectively, especially in children, and may deliver substantially better outcomes for individuals with hemophilia.
 We have demonstrated that subcutaneous dosing of our next-generation coagulation factors results in progressive increases in activity levels until they reach a stable therapeutic target range in the blood. Conversely, dosing by intravenous infusions results in high initial factor activity levels in the blood followed by a rapid fall off in factor activity levels to a low trough level resulting in higher bleeding risk. Stable and higher factor levels could potentially yield a significant improvement in outcomes and have the added benefit of convenience over competing intravenous therapeutics, particularly when administered to children, and where venous access is challenging. This concept is illustrated in the diagram below.
 
We also have several engineered Factor Xa proteases that have demonstrated efficacy in preclinical bleeding models and have the potential to be used as a universal procoagulant. We have delayed initiating further work on our Factor Xa therapeutic program at this time to focus our efforts on the MarzAA and DalcA clinical programs.
 Finally, we have developed novel protease molecules that target the complement cascade, a series of naturally occurring molecular processes that play a central role in the body’s inflammatory and immune response. In October 2017, we announced a strategic research collaboration with Mosaic Biosciences, Inc. to develop intravitreal anti-complement factor three (C3) products for the treatment of dry AMD and other retinal diseases. In December 2018, we amended our collaboration agreement with Mosaic to, among other things, include certain additional products. 
 Based on industry reports and company reported sales, we estimate the 2018 global market opportunity for MarzAA and DalcA to be approximately $2.2 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. Annual worldwide sales in 2018 for FDA-approved recombinant protease products for individuals with hemophilia A or B and an inhibitor were approximately $1.2 billion and approximately $2.2 billion when including prothrombin complex concentrate and bispecific antibody products. We remain focused on advancing the MarzAA and DalcA clinical trials.

Our Product Candidate Pipeline
 We are currently focused on the clinical development of our improved, next-generation enhanced potency Factor VIIa (MarzAA) and Factor IX variants (DalcA) for subcutaneous prophylaxis. We have three additional assets, a FIX gene therapy construct CB 2679d-GT that has demonstrated 3-fold higher activity and 4-5 fold faster clotting time in a preclinical hemophilia B model compared with the Padua variant of FIX that is in clinical development by others, a Factor Xa pro-coagulant and a novel anti-C3 protease program for dry AMD, CB 2782 for which we have a strategic research collaboration with Mosaic and intend to out-license.
 The following table summarizes our development programs.
 
Hemostasis & Hemophilia 
 Hemophilia is a rare but serious bleeding disorder that results from a genetic or an acquired deficiency of a protein required for normal blood coagulation. There are two major types of hemophilia, A and B, that are caused by alterations in Factor VIII or Factor IX genes, respectively, with a corresponding deficiency in the affected proteins. The disease is X chromosome-linked, meaning that most males who inherit the disorder and suffer from symptoms are male. However, female carriers of mutations in Factor VIII or Factor IX can also have reduced clotting factor levels.
 Individuals with hemophilia suffer from spontaneous bleeding episodes and substantially prolonged bleeding times that can become limb- or life-threatening following injury or trauma. In cases of severe hemophilia, spontaneous bleeding into muscles or joints is frequent and often results in permanent, disabling joint damage. Individuals with hemophilia are currently treated with replacement therapy of key coagulation proteins, Factor VIII for Hemophilia A or Factor IX for Hemophilia B.  
 We believe that the shortcomings of currently approved therapies, including a requirement for intravenous infusion, are barriers to prophylactic treatment strategies that, if surmounted, could provide meaningfully improved long-term clinical outcomes for individuals with hemophilia. Catalyst's engineered FVIIa and Factor IX were designed to overcome current treatment limitations by allowing delivery via subcutaneous injection, which we believe will facilitate prophylactic treatment, especially in children, and may ultimately deliver substantially better outcomes for individuals with hemophilia.

Hemophilia A occurs in approximately 1 in 5,000 male births, and hemophilia B in 1 in 20,000 male births. The prevalence of hemophilia A and B in the United States is approximately 20,000 individuals out of an estimated, 400,000 individuals worldwide. 
 Currently there is no cure for hemophilia. Treatment involves management of acute bleeding episodes or prophylactic treatment through factor replacement therapy by intravenous infusion of the individuals’ missing Factor VIII or IX.
 Based on outside research and sales data, we estimate worldwide sales of all Factor IX-containing products for the treatment of hemophilia B in 2018 were at least $1.5 billion, including approximately $0.6 billion as reported by Pfizer, Inc. for its BeneFIX® product and our internal estimate of $0.5 billion by Swedish Orphan Biovitrum for their Alprolix® product and $0.4 billion from CSL Behring for their Idelvion® product.
 A complication for individuals with hemophilia who are receiving factor replacement therapy is the production of neutralizing antibodies, also called inhibitors, that inactivate the replacement factor. The overall prevalence of inhibitor formation is up to 30% in individuals with hemophilia A and up to 5% in individuals with hemophilia B. Individuals with an inhibitor are treated with what are known as bypassing agents that initiate coagulation by a pathway that is independent of Factor VIII or Factor IX, the proteins that are deficient or inactivated in individuals with hemophilia A and B, respectively. Currently available bypassing agents include recombinant Factor VIIa, NovoSeven RT® produced by Novo Nordisk, activated prothrombin complex concentrates, marketed as FEIBA by TAKADA/Shire and Hemlibra®, produced by Roche. NovoSeven RT was first approved in 1999 and is indicated for treatment of bleeding episodes, prevention of bleeding during surgeries in individuals with hemophilia A or B with inhibitors, and individuals with congenital Factor VII deficiency. In 2006, it was approved for the treatment of acquired hemophilia. NovoSeven RT was approved in 2014 and is also indicated for treatment of Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia. Sales of NovoSeven RT in 2018, were $1.2 billion as reported by Novo Nordisk. FEIBA is approved for use in individuals with hemophilia A and B with an inhibitor, which we estimate, based on our research and sales data, had 2018 sales of $0.75 billion. Hemlibra is a bispecific antibody that replaces the role of the cofactor FVIII by bringing FIXa and FX together for activation of FX and was approved by the FDA on November 16, 2017. Sales figures for Hemlibra in 2018 were estimated by industry sources to be $0.2 billion. 
 Hemophilia with Inhibitors—Factor VIIa (“MarzAA”) Program
 Our most advanced product candidate is MarzAA, a potent, subcutaneously administered, next-generation Factor VIIa variant, was tested in an intravenous Phase 1 clinical trial that was completed in February 2015 to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and coagulation activity of MarzAA in severe hemophilia A and B with and without inhibitors. MarzAA is being developed for the prophylactic treatment of individuals with severe hemophilia A or B with inhibitors. Pfizer filed the Investigational New Drug Application (IND) with the FDA for the Phase 1 trial in August 2011 for adult males with hemophilia A or B, with or without inhibitors to Factor VIII or Factor IX. We have received the IND application filed with the FDA from Pfizer and anticipate completion of the Phase 2 trial by the end of 2019. We plan to conduct a global Phase 3 clinical study assessing reductions in ABR in 20-40 patients with hemophilia with six months of daily subcutaneous dosing of MarzAA. MarzAA has received orphan drug designation in the United States from the FDA.
 In the Phase 1 clinical trial of intravenous MarzAA conducted by Pfizer, 25 individuals with severe hemophilia A and B with and without an inhibitor were enrolled and treated. The clinical trial design was a single ascending dose-escalation study with 1 individual treated at 0.5 µg/kg followed by four cohorts of six individuals each at doses of 4.5, 9.0, 18.0, and 30.0 µg/kg. Clinical endpoints included safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and clot-forming activity, such as prothrombin time, or PT, activated partial thromboplastin time, or aPTT, thrombin-antithrombin activity and others. Results showed that single doses of MarzAA were well tolerated and there were no instances of bleeding or thrombosis. MarzAA demonstrated pharmacological efficacy as measured by significant shortening of aPTT (activated partial thromboplastin time) and PT (prothrombin time) for up to 24-hours post dosing. The results were published in Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis 2018, vol 16, 1984-1993.

We designed MarzAA to combine higher clot-generating activity, or potency, at the site of bleeding and improved duration of action in vivo to allow for the effective, long-term, prophylaxis in individuals with hemophilia with inhibitors. We anticipate that this product candidate, if approved, could be used prophylactically to prevent bleeding episodes with subcutaneous administration that may be superior to intravenous infusions. We have previously demonstrated in several bleeding models that MarzAA can treat or prevent bleeding when dosed intravenously. The next step required to develop MarzAA for subcutaneous use was to test its ability to correct bleeding times in hemophilia models and to achieve sufficient plasma (blood) levels of activity when dosed subcutaneously. Daily subcutaneous dosing in dogs for 6 days reduced the whole blood clotting time towards normal. Stable blood levels of MarzAA were seen after the 4th dose onwards (European Association Haemophilia and Allied Disorders 2017).
 During the past 12 months, we have presented data at scientific conferences demonstrating that daily subcutaneous administration in humans had clinically significant reductions in annualized bleed rate (ABR). 
 In the Phase 2 portion of the Phase 2/3 trial of MarzAA for the treatment of hemophilia A or B with inhibitors:
  
• | Seventeen patients were consented and eleven subjects were enrolled (mean annualized bleed rate of 18.2; range of 12.2-26.7).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Of the seven subjects that have completed dosing, all had clinically significant reductions in annualized bleed rate (ABR).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | As of March 7, 2019, two subjects are currently dosing.
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | After more than 450 subcutaneous injections, no antidrug antibodies have been detected, and only one injection site reaction of swelling and 5 mild or moderate redness that stopped after the patient rotated injection to other injection sites, and all resolved without sequelae.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Results are summarized in the chart below. 
 MarzAA reduces annualized bleed rate (ABR) and percentage of days with bleeding
 
The average percentage of days of bleeding in the pre-treatment period was 12.2% (standard deviation 5.2%) [median 11.0%]. In the treatment period, these percentages were reduced to 1.0% (standard deviation 5.2%) [median 1.0%]. The analysis of these pairwise differences by a randomization paired t-test yields p=0.016.

Hemophilia B - Factor IX (“DalcA”) Subcutaneous Program
 Our next most advanced product candidate is DalcA, a next-generation subcutaneously dosed Factor IX drug for the prophylactic treatment of individuals with hemophilia B. The National Hemophilia Foundation has recommended chronic, prophylactic treatment as the optimal therapy for individuals with severe hemophilia B. 
 We have completed a DalcA Phase 1/2 subcutaneous dosing trial in South Korea sponsored by our collaborator, ISU Abxis, that evaluated the safety and efficacy of DalcA in individuals with severe hemophilia B. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of increasing Factor IX activity trough levels from ~1% (severe hemophilia) to >12% (mild hemophilia with a reduced chance of spontaneous joint bleeds) with daily subcutaneous injections. DalcA has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA and orphan medicinal product designation by the COMP of the EC.
 ISU Abxis initiated this trial in June 2017 and top line data was presented on February 9, 2018. Data from Cohorts 1 through 3 (three subjects in each cohort) showed that a single subcutaneous dose of either 70 or 140 IU/kg three days after a single intravenous dose of 70 IU/kg significantly increased the half-life of DalcA to 98.7 hours, equivalent to the half-life of extended-half-life intravenous agents. Cohort 4 was omitted as we observed sufficient activity of DalcA in cohorts 2 and 3. In cohort 5, five subjects were dosed daily for six days with a subcutaneous dose of 140 IU/kg without an intravenous dose. We observed increased Factor IX activity levels in all five subjects from very low levels after washout of prior therapy to a median Factor IX activity level of 16% (range 11.5-18%), that is well into the mild hemophilia range (5-40%) and is higher than the 12% level required to prevent spontaneous hemarthrosis. According to the World Federation of Hemophilia, patients with Factor IX levels between 5% and 40% are considered to have mild hemophilia. The observed increase in Factor IX activity levels after daily dosing in cohort 5 was linear, indicating that continued subcutaneous dosing may achieve high-mild hemophilia Factor IX clotting activity. 
 The terminal subcutaneous half-life was 63.2 hours for subjects in cohort 5 (interquartile range 60.2-64 hours) with the result that activity levels were still 4-6.4%, five days after the last dose. In cohorts one through five, no inhibitors to DalcA or Factor IX were detected. One subject had moderate adverse events of pain, erythema and redness after the first two injections and mild rating after subsequent injections. Other subjects in cohort 5 reported some of these adverse events, mainly with initial injections. Two subjects had bruising after injection when Factor IX activity levels were low that did not occur with subsequent injections as Factor IX activity levels rose. 
 In April 2018, the MFDS approved the addition of a sixth cohort to the Phase 1/2 trial of DalcA in individuals with severe hemophilia B following the positive data from the multi-dose cohort 5. Each individual received a single intravenous dose of 70 IU/kg, followed by nine daily subcutaneous doses of 140 IU/kg DalcA. The intravenous dose was administered 30 minutes before the first subcutaneous dose.
 ISU Abxis enrolled two patients out of a planned three to five in cohort 6, and DalcA showed efficacy in both subjects. During the treatment period, Factor IX activity levels always remained above 20% after the single intravenous dose in both patients. The first patient then had a progressive increase in trough Factor IX activity level to 34% and the second patient achieved a trough activity level of 31%. However, both subjects in cohort 6 developed neutralizing antibodies (“nAbs”) to DalcA and a reduction in Factor IX activity levels was observed. Blood testing revealed that the nAb was transient in one subject and was below the level of quantification at a follow up visit. The nAb in the second subject fell below one Bethesda Unit (“BU”) at a follow up visit. A BU reflects the percentage reduction in Factor IX activity from the standard control of 100%, with one BU being 50% reduction; two BU being 75% reduction and three BU being 87.5% reduction. Importantly, from a safety perspective, the absence of binding to wildtype Factor IX allowed both patients to successfully resume treatment with their prescribed intravenous Factor IX prophylaxis therapies. Prior to cohort 6, no DalcA neutralizing antibodies had been detected in any of the patients treated with DalcA, including both patients in cohort 6 who had also participated in cohort 5. Subsequent to the detection of the nAbs, the investigator treating the two subjects determined that these subjects were cousins and had the identical Factor IX gene defect, however their human leukocyte antigen (“HLA”) profiles were not identical. The HLA system is a gene complex encoding major histocompatibility complex (“MHC”) proteins in humans. These cell-surface proteins are responsible for the regulation of the immune system in humans and allow the immune system to identify foreign proteins within the body. HLA type determines the range of possible immune responses to exogenous proteins and whether antibodies can be made.

DalcA Phase 1/2 clinical trial FIX activity results

We conducted a comprehensive analysis to assess the cause and impact of the antibody observations prior to deciding whether to initiate a Phase 2b study. The comprehensive immunogenicity risk assessment to investigate the development of neutralizing antidrug antibodies in Cohort 6 of the Phase 1/2 program concluded:
  
• | The DalcA drug product does not appear to be inherently immunogenic.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In silico, in vitro and ex vivo analyses indicated that the immunogenicity risk for DalcA is similar to commercial wildtype recombinant FIX products.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The DalcA drug product quality is similar to marketed FIX products.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 7-day subcutaneous non-human primate toxicology studies showed that DalcA subcutaneous injections were well tolerated.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The results of our extensive DalcA immunogenicity risk assessment revealed a similar low immunogenicity potential compared with BeneFIX and other commercial wildtype FIXs products; therefore, we will be moving forward with the clinical development of DalcA. We plan to initiate a Phase 2b trial that will include 28 days of daily subcutaneous dosing in six subjects in the first quarter of 2019 and expect the Phase 2b trial to be completed in the second half of 2019. Based on the efficacy data that we have previously shown in which subjects achieved high mild hemophilia FIX activity, we believe that DalcA has the potential to provide a conveniently-dosed subcutaneous prophylactic treatment option for those suffering from hemophilia B.
 In December 2018, we entered into an amended and restated license agreement with ISU Abxis (the “A&R ISU Abxis Agreement”), which amended and restated in full our previous license and collaboration agreement with ISU Abxis entered into in September 2013 (as subsequently amended in October 2014 and December 2016). Under the A&R ISU Abxis Agreement, ISU Abxis will receive commercialization rights in South Korea to DalcA and we will receive clinical development and commercialization rights in the rest of world (excluding South Korea) and manufacturing development and manufacturing rights worldwide (including South Korea).  The A&R ISU Abxis Agreement eliminates the profit-sharing arrangement in the Original ISU Abxis Agreement and provides for a low single-digit royalty payment to ISU Abxis, on a country-by-country basis, for net product sales of DalcA by us or our affiliates in each country other than South Korea. Pursuant to the A&R ISU Abxis Agreement, the Company will also make up to an aggregate of $19.5 million in milestone payments to ISU Abxis, inclusive of $2.5 million in regulatory and development milestone payments and up to $17 million in commercial milestone payments, if the applicable milestones are met.

Hemophilia B – Factor IX Gene Therapy Program
 Use of the Factor IX Padua variant transgene (Factor IX-R338L) has demonstrated a 5-10 fold greater potency over Factor IX-WT in pre-clinical and clinical gene therapy studies.  Pfizer/Spark (fidanacogene elaparvovec) and uniQure (AMT-061) use the Padua variant as the transgene in their AAV based gene therapy clinical programs and both have demonstrated encouraging Factor IX levels in their respective Phase 1/2 and Phase 2/3 studies with median Factor IX levels of ~30%.
 
We have demonstrated in a hemophilia B mouse study that AAV gene therapy delivery using our CB 2679 gene sequence (FIX-R318Y/R338E/T343R) demonstrated significantly improved clotting activity and a four-fold reduction of bleeding time when compared with Factor IX Padua. This improvement is supported by the observed 22-fold greater clinical potency of DalcA over BeneFIX in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial.
 The Complement Cascade as a Target for Inflammatory Disease
 The complement cascade is a series of naturally occurring molecular processes that play a central role in the body’s inflammatory and immune responses. It helps to localize certain immune system cells at the site of infection or inflammation, to rupture the membranes of pathogens, and to mediate various specific responses to antigens through effects on both B- and T-cells. Consequently, drugs that target the complement cascade could potentially be used in a variety of indications, including prevention of transplant rejection, dry age-related macular degeneration, cardiovascular disease, asthma, and autoimmune disease. Many key targets within the complement cascade are found at such high concentrations that it is likely to be difficult or impractical to block their action with antibodies or small molecules because extremely high drug concentrations would be required for efficacy. We believe that the enzymatic properties of an engineered novel protease could overcome some of the challenges of inhibiting the complement cascade.
Complement in Dry Age-Related Macular Degeneration
 Dry age-related macular degeneration, or dry AMD, is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly worldwide. According to GlobalData, AMD affects approximately 11 million people in the United States of which over 1 million are late stage dry AMD, with the potential size of the dry AMD market worldwide estimated at over $3 billion. The disease is a chronic condition characterized by a progressive loss of central vision due mostly to degenerative changes and/or the formation of microvascular networks in the center of the eye’s visual field, called the macula. There are two forms of AMD, wet and dry. Wet AMD is the more severe form of the disease and represents approximately 10% of all individuals with AMD. Dry AMD is the most common form of early to intermediate stage AMD and occurs in approximately 90% of individuals with the condition. While there have been recent improvements in the treatment of wet AMD, dry AMD treatment remains an unmet medical need.
 Recent studies from several independent investigators have demonstrated that over 70% of the risk of developing AMD (both dry and wet forms) corresponds to mutations in human complement genes, particularly the Factor H gene whose product is required for proper regulation of the complement cascade. Recently Apellis Pharmaceuticals (APL-2, a cyclic peptide that binds Complement Factor 3) announced positive statistically significant results from a randomized Phase 2 trial that APL-2 reduces geographic atrophy (GA) lesion growth associated with dry AMD using a monthly intravitreal injection over 12 months of therapy. This is the first clinical study to validate inhibition of complement, and specifically Complement Factor 3, as a treatment approach for GA associated dry AMD.
 We have demonstrated that our novel unmodified anti-C3 proteases can clear C3 in the vitreous of primates and are well tolerated in single-dose studies. In October 2017, we announced a strategic research collaboration with Mosaic to develop intravitreal anti-complement factor 3 (C3) products for the treatment of dry AMD and other retinal diseases, allowing us to continue to focus our efforts and resources on advancing MarzAA and DalcA through Phase 2/3 and Phase 1/2 clinical trials, respectively. In December 2018, we amended our collaboration agreement with Mosaic to, among other things, include certain additional products. In collaboration with Mosaic we have created an extended half-life version of our anti-C3 protease CB 2782 with a 40 kDa linear PEG.  This Pegylated CB 2782 has indistinguishable enzymatic activity inactivating C3 at the same rate as unmodified CB 2782. We have successfully completed an in vivo intravitreal Rabbit PK study comparing Pegylated CB 2782 with CB 2782 and will report the results of the study at a scientific conference in 2019.

Our Strategy
 Our goal is to build a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company whose mission is to develop valuable therapies for individuals with hemophilia who need new or better treatment options. Key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are to:

• | Advance the Clinical Development of our Lead Product Candidates: Our most advanced drug candidate, MarzAA, for the prophylactic treatment of hemophilia, has completed a Phase 1 intravenous dosing clinical trial evaluating safety and tolerability as well as pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and coagulation activity. We have advanced MarzAA into the Phase 2/3 subcutaneous dosing clinical efficacy trial and anticipate completion of the Phase 2 trial by the end of this year. We plan to conduct a global Phase 3 clinical study assessing reductions in ABR in 20-40 patients with hemophilia with six months of daily subcutaneous dosing of MarzAA. In addition, we are advancing DalcA, our next-generation Factor IX drug candidate in individuals with severe hemophilia B, into a Phase 2b 28-day subcutaneous dosing clinical study in the first quarter of 2019 and we expect the Phase 2b trial to be completed in the second half of 2019. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Build a Hemostasis Franchise: We intend to build on our recent clinical success of our Factor VIIa and Factor IX candidates by completing a Phase 2/3 clinical efficacy trial of our Factor VIIa program starting in 2019 and initiating a Phase 2b trial of our Factor IX product candidate in the first quarter of 2019. The combination of these two product candidates in later-stage clinical development may allow us to build a hemostasis franchise if these product candidates are approved.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Explore options for the Factor IX Gene Therapy Construct: We intend to explore a path forward for our Factor IX gene therapy program which may include research and/or development collaboration(s).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Find a partner for the C3 dry AMD program: We intend to continue developing our C3 dAMD program towards a pre-clinical candidate (including demonstrating PK/PD efficacy in a NHP model) and find a development and commercialization partner.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Collaborations
 Pfizer
 On June 29, 2009, we entered into a Research and License agreement with Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which was subsequently acquired by Pfizer, whereby we and Pfizer collaborated on the development of novel human Factor VIIa products and we granted Pfizer the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize the licensed products on a worldwide basis. On April 2, 2015, Pfizer notified us that it was exercising its right to terminate the research and license agreement effective June 1, 2015. Accordingly, we revised the expected period of performance to end on June 1, 2015, and the deferred revenue balance was fully amortized as of that date. On December 8, 2016, we signed a definitive agreement related to the termination of the Pfizer Agreement. Pursuant to this termination agreement, Pfizer granted us an exclusive license to Pfizer’s proprietary rights for manufacturing materials and processes that apply to Factor VIIa variants, CB 813a and MarzAA. Pfizer also transferred to us the IND application and documentation related to the development, manufacturing and testing of the Factor VIIa products as well as the orphan drug designation. 
 Pursuant to this agreement, we agreed to make contingent cash payments to Pfizer in an aggregate amount equal to up to $17.5 million, payable upon the achievement of clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones. Following commercialization of any covered product, Pfizer would also receive a single-digit royalty on net product sales on a country-by-country basis for a predefined royalty term. In February 2018, we paid Pfizer a $1 million milestone payment based on the dosing of the first patient in the ongoing Phase 2 study, recorded as an R&D expense.

ISU Abxis
 On December 13, 2018, we entered into an Amended and Restated License Agreement (the “A&R ISU Abxis Agreement”), effective as of December 17, 2018, with ISU Abxis, which amends and restates in full our License and Collaboration Agreement with ISU Abxis, dated as of September 16, 2013, as subsequently amended on October 31, 2014 and on December 7, 2016 (the “Original ISU Abxis Agreement”).  Pursuant to the A&R ISU Abxis Agreement, ISU Abxis will receive commercialization rights in South Korea to DalcA and the Company will receive clinical development and commercialization rights in the rest of world (excluding South Korea) and manufacturing development and manufacturing rights worldwide (including South Korea). The A&R ISU Abxis Agreement eliminates the profit-sharing arrangement in the Original ISU Abxis Agreement and provides for a low single-digit royalty payment to ISU Abxis, on a country-by-country basis, for net product sales of DalcA by the Company or its affiliates in each country other than South Korea. Pursuant to the A&R ISU Abxis Agreement, the Company will also make up to an aggregate of $19.5 million in milestone payments to ISU Abxis, inclusive of $2.5 million in regulatory and development milestone payments and up to $17 million in commercial milestone payments, if the applicable milestones are met. 
 Under the Original ISU Abxis Agreement, ISU Abxis paid us a non-refundable upfront signing fee of $1.75 million. ISU Abxis was also obligated, under the Original ISU Abxis Agreement, t
o make contingent cash payments to us of up to $2.75 million payable based upon the achievement of predefined development milestones, of which two were achieved for a total of $2.65 million as of December 31, 2018. 
 The A&R ISU Abxis Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants and indemnification provisions. The A&R ISU Abxis Agreement may be terminated by either party, subject to applicable notice and/or cure periods, upon a material breach by or an event of bankruptcy relating to the other party or by mutual consent of both parties.
 As of December 31, 2018, the cumulative aggregate payments received and recognized by us under the Original ISU Abxis Agreement were $2.65 million and we had made reimbursements of $0.2 million to ISU Abxis, associated with certain preclinical studies in 2018. The adoption of the new revenue standards resulted in a $0.2 million cumulative adjustment to the Company’s opening balance of accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2018. We had no deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2018 related to the ISU Abxis collaboration.
 Intellectual Property
 We have established a broad intellectual property portfolio including patents and patent applications covering the identification, selection, optimization, and manufacture of human proteases, the composition of matter and methods of use of our product candidates and related technology, and other inventions that are important to our business.
 We strive to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business by seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or in conjunction with or in-licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets relating to our proprietary technology platform and on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the field of human protease engineering
 As more fully described below, as of December 31, 2018, our patent portfolio included approximately 161 patents; including 15 issued U.S. patents and 146 foreign granted and accepted patents, and 5 U.S. patent applications, plus an additional 20 pending foreign patent applications. We also rely on trade secrets and careful monitoring of our proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
 Our success will depend significantly on our ability to:
  
• | Obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Defend and enforce our patents;
--+--------------------------------

 15


 
• | Maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets.
 In addition, a third-party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights that are important or necessary to the development of our products. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize our products, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from these third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or our business could be harmed, possibly materially. 
 We are aware of a patent that issued in Europe (with counterparts in Australia, China, Israel, Mexico, Russia, South Korea and Ukraine) that includes a claim that may read on MarzAA. This patent expires in September 2021. An opposition proceeding with respect to this patent sustained the patent; we filed an appeal on November 11, 2016. There can also be no assurance whether the claims of such patent would be found to read on MarzAA even if a claim survives opposition. There is another patent family pending in the U.S. and Europe in which claims that may read on MarzAA have been filed. We, however, do not believe such claims, are patentable. If they were to issue, we would take appropriate action to challenge their enforceability and/or validity. There may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to compositions of matter, materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our product candidates. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications that may later result in issued patents that our product candidates may infringe.
 The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific, and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Consequently, we do not know whether any of our product candidates will be protectable or remain protected by enforceable patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented, or invalidated by third parties.
 Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, or a foreign patent office to determine priority of invention or in post-grant challenge proceedings, such as oppositions, that challenge priority of invention or other features of patentability. Such proceedings could result in substantial cost, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us.
 All our patents and applications were internally developed and assigned to us, except for one pending South Korean patent application that is co-owned. Members of the 4902 family, directed to screening methods (4 patents, including 2 of the issued U.S. patents) are jointly owned with the Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies, which licensed its interest to us. Our current patents and patent applications include:
  
• | 69 patents, including 3 issued U.S. patents, and 4 patent applications, including 1 pending U.S. patent application, covering modified Factor VII polypeptides, such as our lead product candidate, MarzAA, and methods of production of modified Factor VII polypeptides. The U.S. patents, with patent term adjustment, expire in 2031 and 2029. The foreign patents and patent applications, if granted, expire, or are expected to expire, respectively, in 2028-2029.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 16


 
• | 18 patents, including 3 issued U.S. patents, and 10 patent applications, including 2 U.S. patent applications, covering modified Factor IX polypeptides, such as our clinical candidate DalcA. The U.S. patents and patent applications, including patent term adjustment, expire, or are expected to expire, respectively, in 2030-2032 and 2038, and the foreign patents and patent applications, if granted, expire, or are expected to expire, respectively, in 2031.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 15 patents, including 2 issued U.S. patents, and 6 patent applications, covering improved Factor Xa variants and methods of production of improved Factor Xa variants. The issued patents and patent applications, if granted, including patent term adjustment, expire, or are expected to expire in 2033.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 56 patents, including 5 issued U.S. patents, and 5 patent applications, including 2 U.S. patent applications, covering novel proteases. The U.S. patents and patent applications, including patent term adjustment, expire, or are expected to expire, respectively in 2025-2029 and 2038-2039, and the foreign patents and foreign patent applications, if granted, expire, or are expected to expire, in 2025-2027.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 4 patents, including 2 issued U.S. patents, covering methods for identifying proteases that cleave or inactivate a protein target. The U.S. patents, including patent term adjustment, expire in 2027 and 2030, and the foreign patents expire in 2027.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The term for individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in that country or the international filing date. In the United States, a patent’s term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the United States Patent and Trademark Office in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date.
 The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration date of a U.S. patent as partial compensation for the length of time the drug is under regulatory review while the patent is in force. The regulatory review period that occurs after the patent to be extended was issued is eligible to be counted for extension. The extension is calculated as one-half of the time of the testing phase added to time in the approval phase. The testing phase is the period between the effective date of an investigational product exemption (Investigational New Drug Application) and the initial submission of the marketing application (New Drug Application). The approval phase is the period between the submission and approval of the marketing application. Extensions can be reduced by any time that the applicant did act not with due diligence as determined by the FDA. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval. Only one patent applicable to each regulatory review period may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Similar provisions are available in the European Union and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug.
 In the future, to the extent our product candidates including MarzAA, DalcA, and novel anti-C3 proteases receive approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those products, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each drug and other factors.
 In addition to the intellectual property described above, we obtained the intellectual property related to a neural nicotinic receptor (“NNR”) portfolio from our business combination with Targacept, Inc. completed in August 2015 (See “Business Organization”). We completed the process of out-licensing, selling off and terminating the remaining NNR portfolio in 2016.

Manufacturing
 We do not have any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for the commercial manufacture of our product candidates that receive marketing approval. Pfizer was responsible for manufacturing MarzAA for clinical trials pursuant to our license and collaboration agreement with Pfizer.  
 On May 20, 2016, we signed a development and manufacturing services agreement with AGC Biologics, Inc. (“AGC”), formerly known as CMC ICOS Biologics, Inc., pursuant to which AGC will conduct manufacturing development of agreed upon product candidates. We will own all intellectual property developed in such manufacturing development activities that are specifically related to our product candidates and will have a royalty-free and perpetual license to use AGC’s intellectual property to the extent reasonably necessary to make these product candidates, including commercial manufacturing. In 2016 we commenced manufacturing activities for MarzAA, and together with AGC we have successfully manufactured MarzAA for the Phase 2 portion of a planned Phase 2/3 clinical trial. ISU Abxis was responsible for manufacturing DalcA, our next-generation Factor IX drug candidate, through the completion of the Phase 1/2 clinical trials, after which we will be responsible for manufacturing this product candidate. In February 2018 we entered into a statement of work for AGC for process transfer and clinical scale manufacturing of DalcA.
 We have agreed to a total of $3.8 million in payments to AGC pursuant to the initial statement of work for MarzAA under the Agreement, and an additional $5.6 million for the statement of work for DalcA, in each case subject to completion of applicable work stages. In the event that clinical manufacturing batches need to be cancelled or rescheduled, we would be obligated to pay for a portion of AGC’s manufacturing fees less certain fees that AGC is able to mitigate. The initial term of the agreement is ten years or, if later, until all stages under outstanding statements of work have been completed. Either party may terminate the agreement in its entirety upon written notice of a material uncured breach or upon the other party’s bankruptcy, and we may terminate the agreement upon prior notice for any reason. In addition, each party may terminate the agreement in the event that the manufacturing development activities cannot be completed for technical or scientific reasons. As of December 31, 2018, we have $0.3 million in payment obligations to AGC remaining under the initial statement of work for MarzAA and $3.4 million in payment obligations related to DalcA. 
 On December 14, 2016, we signed a Master Services Agreement with Symbiosis Pharmaceutical Services Limited, pursuant to which Symbiosis will conduct Drug Product manufacturing development and, upon successful development of the manufacturing process, manufacture the Drug Product MarzAA that the Company intends to use in its clinical trials on a fee-for-services basis. We have completed the transfer of manufacturing technology from Pfizer to Symbiosis and together with Symbiosis have successfully manufactured MarzAA for our Phase 2/3 clinical trial. 
 Commercialization
 We have not yet established a sales, marketing, or product distribution infrastructure for our other product candidates, which are still in preclinical or early clinical development. Except for ISU Abxis’ potential rights to commercialize DalcA in South Korea and our anti-C3 dry AMD program, we expect to retain commercial rights for our product candidates. We believe that it will be possible to access the United States hemophilia market through a focused, specialized sales force. We have not yet developed a commercial hemophilia strategy outside of the United States. At this time, we intend to partner our anti-C3 dry AMD program for global development and commercialization. 
Competition
 Our product candidates will face competition from approved therapeutics. Competition for our product candidate pipeline comes primarily from large, well-established pharmaceutical companies, who have greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, conducting clinical trials, and marketing approved products. Mergers and acquisitions within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may further concentrate competitors’ resources. We are not only competing with these companies in terms of technology, but also in recruiting and retaining qualified scientists and management personnel, in establishing partnerships with clinical trial sites, and in registering individuals into clinical trials.
 18


In addition to current standard of care for individuals, clinical trials are being pursued by several parties in the field of biologics and in our lead indications. These products in development may provide efficacy, safety, convenience, and other benefits that are not provided by currently marketed therapies. As a result, they may provide significant competition for any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Based on publicly available information, the following are some of the products being developed by competitors in indications overlapping with those of our programs.
  
• | Factor VIIa Competition: Novo Nordisk’s NovoSeven RT is a recombinant Factor VIIa indicated for treatment of bleeding episodes. NovoSeven RT was approved by the FDA in 1999 for use in the treatment of individuals with hemophilia A or B with an inhibitor to Factor VIII or Factor IX. The treatment has since been approved for use in individuals with Factor VII deficiency and Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia. Takeda’s FEIBA is a plasma-based composition of coagulation factors indicated for on-demand and prophylactic use in the treatment of individuals with hemophilia A or B with an inhibitor to Factor VIII or Factor IX and has been on the market for more than 30 years. Roche’s Hemlibra, a bispecific Factor IXa-Factor X monoclonal antibody for routine prophylaxis in adults and children with hemophilia A with a Factor VIII inhibitor received approval from the FDA on November 16, 2017. Several other companies have competing products under development, including companies developing biosimilars of NovoSeven RT such as rEVO Biologics LF769, which has completed a Phase 3 clinical trial, Alnylam is developing an investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting antithrombin for the treatment of hemophilia which is in a Phase 3 clinical trial, CSL Behring is developing an albumin–linked Factor VIIa that has an extended half-life and is currently in a Phase 2/3 study and OPKO Biologics, whose recombinant Factor VIIa product may be administered subcutaneously, is in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial. Novo Nordisk, Bayer and Pfizer are also developing subcutaneously administered agents that neutralize Tissue Pathway Factor Inhibitor in mid-stage clinical trials.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Factor IX Competition: BeneFIX, a recombinant Factor IX indicated for treatment of individuals with hemophilia B, was approved in 1997 and is marketed by Pfizer, which, according to Pfizer’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, reported 2018 revenues of $0.6 billion. In addition, Alprolix, a Factor IX-Fc fusion product was approved in 2014 and is marketed by Sanofi Aventis and Swedish Orphan Biovitrum (SOBI - in Europe, Russia, North Africa and the Middle East) with 2018 revenues of $0.5 billion. CSL Behring announced that their biologics license application (BLA) for their Idelvion (rFIX) product was approved by the FDA on March 4, 2016 and we estimate their 2018 sales to be $0.4 billion. Novo Nordisk’s glycopegylated-Factor IX product RebinynÒ was approved by the FDA on May 31, 2017 but is not indicated for routine prophylaxis.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FIX Gene Therapy Competition: While there are no currently approved Factor IX gene therapy treatments for Hemophilia B, several companies, notably uniQure, Pfizer/Spark and Freeline are developing Factor IX gene therapy treatments and are in late stage clinical studies. Both uniQure and Pfizer/Spark (each use the Padua variant transgene) are in Phase 3 studies and Freeline (using a novel 2 mutation variant transgene, one of which is the Padua mutation) is in a Phase 2/3 study.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Dry AMD Competition: While there are no currently approved treatments for dry AMD that we believe would pose a long-term competitive risk, several companies, including Apellis, Ophthotech and Novartis are developing cyclic peptide, aptamer or antibody-based anti-complement product candidates for the treatment of dry AMD that are currently in Phase 3 (Apellis) or Phase 2 (Ophthotech and Novartis) studies. Of note, Apellis’ APL-2 (cyclic peptide that binds C3) demonstrated statistically significant efficacy in reducing the growth rate of geographic atrophy lesions associated with dry AMD in a randomized Phase 2 study with monthly intravitreal injections over a 12-month period. We are initiating proof-of-concept NHP primate studies in the first half of 2019.

Our commercial opportunity in different indications could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and market products that are more convenient to use, more effective, less expensive, and safer to use than our products. Furthermore, if competitors gain FDA approval faster than we do, we may be unable to establish a strong market presence or to gain market share. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of generic competition, and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
 Government Regulation
 As a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that operates in the United States, we are subject to extensive regulation. Our engineered human protease products will be regulated as biological products. Biological products, including engineered human proteases, are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, and other federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations. The FD&C Act and the PHS Act and their implementing regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of biological products. FDA approval must be obtained before clinical testing of a biological product begins and before the marketing of biological products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development, the approval process, or after product approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include, among other actions, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
US Biological Products Development Process
 The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
  
• | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to good laboratory practices, or GLPs, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a biologics license application or BLA for marketing approval that includes substantial evidence of safety, purity and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with good manufacturing practices or GMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity and, if applicable, the FDA’s current good tissue practices, or GTPs, for the use of human cellular and tissue products;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 20


 
• | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical study and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.
--+---------------------------------------------------

 Before testing any biological product candidate, including an engineered human protease, in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLPs.
 The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with the manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after an IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical study on a clinical hold within that 30-day period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trials.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research patients provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Clinical trials also may be reviewed by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research conducted at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
  
• | Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2: The product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3: Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 21


In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible such as in rare or orphan diseases like hemophilia. In the case of hemophilia, almost all clinical trials are conducted as open-label trials, in which both the researchers and participants know which treatment is being administered and there is no placebo or blinded portion of the trial because there are too few subjects available in these orphan populations to perform statistically powered placebo or active comparator trials. Endpoints for on-demand therapies are the number of treatments required to control bleeding episodes and for prophylaxis therapies are the calculated annualized bleeding rates. Bleeding rates during the trial are compared to historic bleeding rates for participating individuals. Patients are studied for at least 50 treatment days to see if neutralizing anti-drug antibodies (inhibitors) develop.  
 Pursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act, which was enacted on December 13, 2016, the manufacturer of an investigational drug for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access to such investigational drug. This requirement applies on the later of 60 calendar days after the date of enactment of the law or the initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial of the investigational drug.
 Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.
 Concurrently with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with GMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 US Review and Approval Processes
 After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human trials, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual product fee for biological products and an annual establishment fee on facilities used to manufacture prescription biological products. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.  MarzAA has been granted orphan drug designation for routine prophylaxis to prevent bleeding episodes in individuals with hemophilia A and B with inhibitors.
 22


Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with GMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve a BLA without a REMS, if required.
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will generally inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with GMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements. To assure GMP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control.
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers.
 Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than how we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that describes all the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
 The FDA has agreed to certain review goals under PDUFA and aims to complete its review of 90% of standard BLAs within ten months from filing and 90% of priority BLAs within six months from filing. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests, or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides, additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.

Fast Track Designation, Accelerated Approval, Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy Programs
 The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life- threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biological product may request the FDA to designate the drug or biological product as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. Under a Fast Track designation, the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application.
 Other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review, accelerated approval and Breakthrough Therapy designation, also exist. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review to facilitate the review. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval, pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
 A product may also be eligible for receipt of a Breakthrough Therapy designation. The Breakthrough Therapy designation is intended to expedite the FDA’s review of a potential new drug for serious or life-threatening diseases where “preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development.” The designation of a drug as a Breakthrough Therapy provides the same benefits as are available under the Fast Track program, as well as intensive FDA guidance on the product’s development program. Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and Breakthrough Therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process.
 Post-approval Requirements
 Maintaining substantial compliance with applicable federal, state and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to GMP. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the GMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products include reporting of GMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency and effectiveness of biological products.
 24


We also must comply with the FDA’s advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in-patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with GMPs and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain GMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
 Orphan Drug Designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. MarzAA has been granted orphan drug designation for routine prophylaxis to prevent bleeding episodes in individuals with hemophilia A and B with inhibitors. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, for seven years. These circumstances are an inability to supply the drug in sufficient quantities or a situation in which a new formulation of the drug has shown superior safety or efficacy or a major contribution to patient care. This exclusivity, however, could also block the approval of our product for seven years if a competitor obtains earlier approval of the same drug for the same indication.
Marketing Exclusivity and U.S. Patent Term Restoration
 The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA, amended the PHS Act to authorize the FDA to approve similar versions of innovative biologics, commonly known as biosimilars. A competitor seeking approval of a biosimilar must file an application to establish its molecule as highly similar to an approved innovator biologic, among other requirements. The BPCIA, however, bars the FDA from accepting biosimilar applications for four years after an innovator biological product receives initial marketing approval and from approving biosimilar applications for 12 years after an innovator biological product receives initial marketing approval. As innovative biological products, we believe that our products would receive this data protection if the FDA approves them for marketing.
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity that may apply to biological products approved in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods, include the 4- and 12-year periods discussed. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial.
 25


Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents, if granted, may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years, as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.
 Disclosure of clinical trial information
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including biological products, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
 Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the privacy provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and similar state laws, each as amended.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not in all cases meet all the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor.
 Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Affordable Care Act to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (discussed below).
 26


The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 The federal False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses.
 HIPAA created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of, or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
 We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
 To distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 27


If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to that third-party payors provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or also known as a formulary, which might not include all the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product.  This is also true of Medicare reimbursement, where different vendors process payments, so that coverage by one vendor does not assure that all other vendors will provide coverage.  Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.  In addition, the United States federal government position on matters related to drug pricing is evolving and uncertain, and any changes could have a material impact on drug pricing generally in the United States, including for our product candidates if approved.
 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the EU, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. NICE in the United Kingdom also requires consideration of cost-benefit analysis.  The downward pressure on health care costs has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third- party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on healthcare pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 28


The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
Additional Regulation
 In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern the use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on its business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect its future operations.
Government Regulation Outside of the United States
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval of a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the EU, for example, a clinical trial application must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the clinical trial application is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries.
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug or biological product under EU regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the EU, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements.
 For other countries outside of the EU, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 If we or our potential collaborators fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.

Research and Development
 Our research and development costs were $21.5 million and $12.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. See “Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for additional details regarding our research and development activities.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 21 full-time employees, 4 of whom have Ph.D. or M.D. degrees. Of these full-time employees, 10 employees are engaged in manufacturing and clinical development activities and 11 employees are engaged in finance, business development, facilities and general management. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees, and we have not experienced any work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Business Organization
 We commenced operations in 2002 and are a Delaware corporation. On August 20, 2015, we (“Catalyst Bio”) completed our business combination with Targacept, Inc., which was incorporated in Delaware in 1997. Following the completion of the merger, the business conducted by the Company became primarily the business conducted by Catalyst Bio prior to the merger. In this annual report, we refer to the business combination as the “merger,” to the Company prior to the merger as “Targacept.” Discussions of historical results reflect the results of Catalyst Bio prior to the completion of the merger and do not include the historical results of Targacept prior to the completion of the merger.
 Our corporate headquarters are in South San Francisco, California. We report segment information using the “management approach.” Under this approach, operating segments are identified in substantially the same manner as they are reported internally and used by us for purposes of evaluating performance and allocating resources. Based on this approach, we have one reportable business segment. Our management reporting process is based on our internal operating structure, which is subject to change and is not necessarily similar to that of other comparable companies. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For financial information regarding our business, see “Part II - Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes.
