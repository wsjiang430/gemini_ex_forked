As part of these activities, these suppliers have responsibility for procuring the components and sub-assemblies either from us or third-party suppliers. While the outsourced suppliers of our printers have responsibility for the supply chain and inventory of components for the printers they assemble, the components, parts and sub-assemblies that are used in our printers are generally available from several potential suppliers.
We produce materials at our facilities in Rock Hill, South Carolina, Marly, Switzerland and Soesterberg, Netherlands. We also have arrangements with third parties who blend certain materials according to our specifications that we sell under our own brand names, and we purchase certain materials from third parties for resale to our customers.
Our equipment assembly and materials blending activities, on demand manufacturing services and certain research and development activities are subject to compliance with applicable federal, state and local provisions regulating the storage, use and discharge of materials into the environment. We believe that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with such regulations as currently in effect, and we expect continued compliance with them will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations or consolidated financial position.
Research and Development
The 3D printing industry continues to experience rapid technological change and developments in hardware, software and materials. Consequently, we have ongoing research and development programs to develop new products and to enhance our portfolio of products and services, as well as to improve and expand the capabilities of our solutions. Our efforts are often augmented by development arrangements with research institutions, customers, suppliers, assembly and design firms, engineering companies, materials companies and other partners.
In addition to our internally developed technology platforms, we have acquired products and technologies developed by others by acquiring business entities that held ownership rights to such products and technologies. In other instances, we have licensed or purchased the intellectual property rights of technologies developed by third parties through agreements that may obligate us to pay a license fee or royalty, typically based upon a dollar amount per unit or a percentage of the revenue generated by such products.
Intellectual Property
We regard our technology platforms and materials as proprietary and seek to protect them through copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade secrets. At December 31, 2018 and 2017 we held 1,250 and 1,171 patents worldwide, respectively. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had 295 and 271 pending patent applications worldwide, respectively. The principal issued patents covering aspects of our various technologies will expire at varying times through the year 2027.
In addition, we are a party to various licenses that have had the effect of broadening the range of the patents, patent applications and other intellectual property available to us.
We have also entered into licensing or cross-licensing arrangements with various companies in the U.S. and other countries that enable those companies to utilize our technologies in their products or that enable us to use their technologies in our products. Under certain of these licenses, we are entitled to receive, or we are obligated to pay, royalties for the sale of licensed products in the U.S. or in other countries. The amount of such royalties was not material to our results of operations or financial position for the three-year period ended December 31, 2018.
We believe that, while our patents and licenses provide us with a competitive advantage, our success also depends on our marketing, business development, applications know-how and ongoing research and development efforts. Accordingly, we believe the expiration of any of the patents, patent applications or licenses discussed above would not be material to our business or financial position.
Competition
We compete with other suppliers of 3D printers, materials, software and healthcare solutions as well as with suppliers of conventional manufacturing solutions. We compete with these suppliers for customers as well as channel partners for certain of our products. We also compete with businesses and service bureaus that use such equipment to produce models, prototypes, molds and end-use

parts.  Development of new technologies or techniques not encompassed by the patents that we own or license may result in additional future competition.
Our competitors operate both globally and regionally, and many of them have well-recognized brands and product lines. Additionally, certain of our competitors are well established and may have greater financial resources than us.
We believe principal competitive factors include technology capabilities, materials, process and application know-how, total cost of operation of solution, product reliability and the ability to provide a full range of products and services to meet customer needs. We believe that our future success depends on our ability to provide high quality solutions, introduce new products and services to meet evolving customer needs and market opportunities, and extend our technologies to new applications. Accordingly, our ongoing research and development programs are intended to enable us to continue technology advancement and develop innovative new solutions for the marketplace.
