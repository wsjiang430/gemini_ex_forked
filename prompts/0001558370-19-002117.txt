 Item 1. Business
 Overview
 Southern National Bancorp of Virginia, Inc. (“Southern National”, “SNBV”, “we” or “our”) is the bank holding company for Sonabank (“Sonabank” or the “Bank”), a Virginia state chartered bank which commenced operations on April 14, 2005. Sonabank provides a range of financial services to individuals and small and medium sized businesses. As of December 31, 2018, Southern National had $2.18 billion in total loans, $2.70 billion in total assets, $2.10 billion in total deposits and $348.3 million in total stockholders’ equity.  At December 31, 2018, Sonabank had thirty-eight full-service retail branches in Virginia, located in the counties of Chesterfield (2), Essex (2), Fairfax (Reston, McLean and Fairfax), Gloucester (2), Hanover (3), King William, Lancaster, Middlesex (3), New Kent, Northumberland (3), Southampton, Surry, Sussex, and in Charlottesville, Clifton Forge, Colonial Heights, Front Royal, Hampton, Haymarket, Leesburg, Middleburg, New Market, Newport News, Richmond, South Riding, Warrenton, and Williamsburg, and seven full-service retail branches in Maryland, in Rockville, Shady Grove, Bethesda, Upper Marlboro, Brandywine, Owings and Huntingtown.
 While we offer a wide range of commercial banking services, we focus on making loans secured primarily by commercial real estate and other types of secured and unsecured commercial loans to small and medium-sized businesses in a number of industries, as well as loans to individuals for a variety of purposes, including 1‑4 family residential loans. We are a leading Small Business Administration (“SBA”) lender among Virginia community banks. We also invest in real estate-related securities, including collateralized mortgage obligations and agency mortgage backed securities. Our principal sources of funds for loans and investing in securities are deposits and, to a lesser extent, borrowings. We offer a broad range of deposit products, including checking (NOW), savings, money market accounts and certificates of deposit. We actively pursue business relationships by utilizing the business contacts of our senior management, other bank officers and our directors, thereby capitalizing on our knowledge of our local market areas.
 Effective December 4, 2009, Sonabank assumed certain deposits and liabilities and acquired certain assets of Greater Atlantic Bank (“GAB”) from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), as receiver for GAB, pursuant to the terms of a purchase and assumption agreement entered into by the Bank and the FDIC on December 4, 2009. On December 5, 2009, the former GAB offices, located in Reston, New Market, Front Royal and South Riding, Virginia and Rockville, Maryland opened as Sonabank branches.
 Covered loan losses are reimbursed in accordance with our FDIC loss sharing agreements. There are two agreements with the FDIC, one for single family assets which is a 10 year agreement expiring in December 2019, and one for non-single family (commercial) assets which was a 5 year agreement that expired in December 2014. 
 On October 1, 2011, Sonabank completed the acquisition of the Midlothian branch of the Bank of Hampton Roads in Richmond, Virginia. We assumed deposits in the amount of $42.2 million.
 Effective April 27, 2012, Sonabank assumed substantially all of the deposits and liabilities and acquired substantially all of the assets of the HarVest Bank of Maryland from the FDIC as receiver. The acquisition included HarVest Bank’s branches in Bethesda, Shady Grove, Germantown and Frederick, Maryland. Adding these new branches to our existing branch in Rockville, Maryland brought Sonabank’s total number of branches in Maryland to five, four of which are in Montgomery County, Maryland. This was a strategic acquisition for Sonabank in order to expand into an affluent market.
 The merger with Prince George’s Federal Savings Bank (“PGFSB”) was completed on August 1, 2014. Southern National acquired PGFSB in a cash and stock transaction. Sonabank acquired PGFSB’s four offices in Maryland, including a main office in Upper Marlboro and three branch offices in Dunkirk, Brandywine and Huntingtown.
 On May 15, 2014, SNBV purchased a 44% equity investment and preferred stock of Southern Trust Mortgage, LLC (“STM”), a regional mortgage banking company headquartered in Virginia Beach, Virginia. On June 23, 2017, in

connection with the Eastern Virginia Bankshares, Inc. (“EVBS”) acquisition, we added 4.9% of additional equity investment and preferred stock in STM, bringing our total equity investment to 48.9%. As of December 31, 2018, our equity investment in STM totaled $3.8 million and our preferred stock investment in STM totaled $3.3 million. STM has mortgage banking originators in Delaware, Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina and South Carolina. STM only originates retail mortgages.
 On January 20, 2017, Southern National completed the sale of $27.0 million of its fixed-to-floating rate Subordinated Notes due 2027 (the “SNBV Senior Subordinated Notes”). The SNBV Senior Subordinated Notes will initially bear interest at 5.875% per annum until January 31, 2022; thereafter, the SNBV Senior Subordinated Notes will be payable at an annual floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus a spread of 3.95% until maturity or early redemption. Immediately following the completion of the sale of the SNBV Senior Subordinated Notes, Southern National injected $22.0 million of the proceeds into its subsidiary, Sonabank.
 On June 23, 2017, SNBV completed its acquisition of EVBS, headquartered in Glen Allen, Virginia, and its subsidiaries, EVB Statutory Trust I (the “Trust”) and EVB, a Virginia state-charted bank. Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated December 13, 2016, as amended, holders of EVBS common stock received 0.6313 shares of SNBV common stock for each outstanding share of EVBS common stock held immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and holders of Non-Voting Mandatorily Convertible Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series B of EVBS (“EVBS Series B Preferred Stock”) received 0.6313 shares of SNBV common stock for each share of EVBS Series B Preferred Stock held immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, which totaled approximately $198.9 million based on SNBV’s closing common stock price on June 23, 2017 of $17.21 per share. EVBS operated twenty-four retail branches in Virginia.
 We primarily market our products and services to small and medium-sized businesses and to retail consumers. Our strategy is to provide superior service through our employees, who are relationship-oriented and committed to their respective customers. Through this strategy, we intend to grow our business, expand our customer base and improve our profitability. The key elements of our strategy are to:

· | Utilize the Strength of our Management Team. The experience and market knowledge of our management team is one of our greatest strengths and competitive advantages. Our executive chairman of the board, Georgia S. Derrico, served as chairman of the board and chief executive officer of Southern National until our merger with EVBS on June 23, 2017. Our executive vice chairman of the board, R. Roderick Porter, served as president of Southern National until our merger with EVBS on June 23, 2017. Ms. Derrico and Mr. Porter have over 50 years of banking experience. As part of the merger with EVBS on June 23, 2017, legacy EVBS president and chief executive officer, Joe A. Shearin, assumed the same role with Southern National. Mr. Shearin, currently our chief executive officer has nearly 40 years of bank management experience. These three individuals comprise our newly created office of the chairman, which serves as the senior executive leadership of Southern National.

· | Leverage Our Existing Foundation for Additional Growth. Based on our management’s depth of experience and certain infrastructure investments, we believe that we will be able to take advantage of certain economies of scale typically enjoyed by larger organizations to expand our operations both organically and through strategic cost-effective branch or bank acquisitions. We believe that the investments we have made in our data processing, risk management infrastructure, staff and branch network will be able to support a much larger asset base. We are committed, however, to control any additional growth in a manner designed to minimize the risk and to maintain strong capital ratios.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Continue to Pursue Selective Acquisition Opportunities. Historically, acquisitions have been a key part of our growth. In addition to the transactions previously highlighted, we completed the acquisition of a branch of Millennium Bank in Warrenton, Virginia on September 28, 2009, the acquisition of the Leesburg, Virginia branch location from Founders Corporation which opened on February 11, 2008, the acquisition of 1st Service Bank in December of 2006 and the acquisition of the Clifton Forge branch of First Community Bancorp, Inc. in December of 2005. We intend to continue to review branch and whole bank acquisition opportunities, including possible acquisitions of failed financial institutions in FDIC-assisted transactions, and will pursue these opportunities if they represent the most efficient use of our capital under the circumstances. We believe that we have demonstrated the skill sets and experience necessary to acquire and integrate successfully both bank and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

branch acquisitions, and that with our strong capital position, we are well-positioned to take advantage of acquisition opportunities as they may arise. We intend to focus on targets in our market areas or other attractive areas with significant core deposits and/or a potential customer base compatible with our growth strategy.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | New Branch Expansion. In addition to our acquisition strategy, we plan to open new branches from time to time to fill in our existing footprint. We opened our newest full-service branch in the River’s Bend market located in Chesterfield County, Virginia in October 2017. This branch, which was part of the EVBS merger, is located in a dynamic growth area with new businesses and consumers entering the market every day. Additionally, this market compliments our focus on the south of Richmond market which includes Colonial Heights, Tri-Cities and Midlothian.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Focus on the Business Owner. It is our goal to be the bank that business owners in our markets turn to first for commercial banking needs as a result of our superior personal service and the tailored products and services that we provide. To help achieve this goal, we:
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | have a standing credit committee that meets as often as necessary on a “when needed” basis to review completed loan applications, making extensive use of technology to facilitate our internal communications and thereby enabling us to respond to our customers promptly;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | are an SBA approved “Preferred” lender, which permits us to make SBA loan decisions at Sonabank rather than waiting for SBA processing. We offer a number of different types of SBA loans designed for the small and medium-sized business owner and many of our SBA loan customers also have other relationships with Sonabank. This product group is complex and “paper intensive” and not well utilized by some of our competitors;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | provide Internet business banking at www.sonabank.com which allows our business customers 24‑hour web-based access to their accounts so they can confirm or transfer balances, pay bills, download statements and use our “Web Lockbox” or “Sona Cash Manager;”
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | provide our business customers with “Sona In-House,” a service that utilizes Check 21 technology to allow customers to make remote deposits from their business locations and gives them access to those funds within 24 to 48 hours; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | provide our business customers with access to SABL, our state-of-the-art asset-based lending system. Unlike most asset-based lending systems, which are based on manual processes or software that certifies a company’s borrowing base periodically, SABL provides a real time capability to analyze and adjust borrowing availability based on actual collateral levels. SABL is predicated on a link between any kind of accounting software used by the customer and Sonabank’s server.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Maintain Local Decision-Making and Accountability. We believe that we have a competitive advantage over larger national and regional financial institutions by providing superior customer service with experienced, knowledgeable management, localized decision-making capabilities and prompt credit decisions. We believe that our customers want to deal directly with the people who make the credit decisions.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Focus on Asset Quality and Strong Underwriting. We consider asset quality to be of primary importance and have taken measures in an effort to ensure that, despite the growth in our loan portfolio, we maintain strong asset quality through strong underwriting standards.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Build a Stable Core Deposit Base. We intend to continue to grow a stable core deposit base of business and retail customers. To the extent that our asset growth outpaces this local deposit funding source, we plan to continue to borrow and raise deposits in the national market using deposit intermediaries. We intend to continue our practice of developing a deposit relationship with each of our loan customers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  General
 Our principal business is the acquisition of deposits from the general public through our branch offices and deposit intermediaries and the use of these deposits to fund our loan and investment security portfolios. We seek to be a full service community bank that provides a wide variety of financial services to our middle market corporate clients as well as to our retail clients. We are an active commercial lender, have been designated as a “Preferred SBA Lender” and participate in the Virginia Small Business Financing Authority lending program. In addition, we are an active commercial real estate lender. We also invest funds in mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, securities issued by agencies of the federal government, obligations of states and political subdivisions and pooled trust preferred securities.

 The principal sources of funds for our lending and investment activities are deposits, repayment of loans, prepayments from mortgage-backed securities, repayments of maturing investment securities, Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances and other borrowed money.
 Principal sources of revenue are interest and fees on loans and investment securities, as well as fee income derived from the maintenance of deposit accounts and income from bank-owned life insurance policies. Our principal expenses include interest paid on deposits, advances from the FHLB of Atlanta, junior subordinated debt, senior subordinated notes and other borrowings, and operating expenses.
 Available Information
 Southern National files annual, quarterly, periodic and other reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, with the SEC. These reports are posted and are available at no cost on our website, www.sonabank.com, through the Investor Relations link, as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such documents with the SEC. Our filings are also available through the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. Lending Activities
 Our primary strategic objective is to serve small to medium-sized businesses in our market with a variety of unique and useful services, including a full array of commercial mortgage and non-mortgage loans. These loans include commercial real estate loans, construction to permanent loans, development and builder loans, accounts receivable financing, lines of credit, equipment and vehicle loans, leasing, and commercial overdraft protection. We strive to do business in the areas served by our branches, which is also where our marketing is focused, and the vast majority of our loan customers are located in existing market areas. Substantially all of our loans are with borrowers in Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C. The SBA may from time to time come to us because of our reputation and expertise as an SBA lender and ask us to review a loan outside of our core counties but within our market area. Prior to making a loan, we obtain loan applications to determine a borrower’s ability to repay, and the more significant items on these applications are verified through the use of credit reports, financial statements and confirmations.
 The following is a discussion of each of the major types of lending in which we engage. For more information on our lending activities, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition.”
 Commercial Real Estate Lending
 Permanent. Commercial real estate lending includes loans for permanent financing. Commercial real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of loans is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the properties securing the loans to cover operating expenses and debt service. As a general practice, we require our commercial real estate loans to be secured by well-managed income producing properties with adequate margins and to be guaranteed by responsible parties. We look for opportunities where cash flow from the collateral properties provides adequate debt service coverage and the guarantor’s net worth is strong. At December 31, 2018, our commercial real estate loans for permanent financing, including multi-family residential loans and loans secured by farmland, totaled $1.05 billion. Owner occupied commercial real estate loans totaled $407.0 million.
 Our underwriting guidelines for commercial real estate loans reflect all relevant credit factors, including, among other things, the income generated from the underlying property to adequately service the debt, the availability of secondary sources of repayment and the overall creditworthiness of the borrower. In addition, we look to the value of the collateral, while maintaining the level of equity invested by the borrower.
 All valuations on property which will secure loans over $250 thousand are performed by independent outside appraisers who are reviewed by our executive vice president of credit risk management and/or our appraisal reviewer. We retain a valid lien on real estate and obtain a title insurance policy (on first trust loans only) that insures the property is free of encumbrances. In addition, we do title searches on all loans secured by real estate.

 Construction. We recognize that construction loans for commercial, multifamily and other non-residential properties can involve risk due to the length of time it may take to bring a finished real estate product to market. As a result, we will only make these types of loans when pre-leasing or pre-sales or other credit factors suggest that the borrower can carry the debt if the anticipated market and property cash flow projections change during the construction phase.
 Income producing property loans are supported by evidence of the borrower’s capacity to service the debt. All of our commercial construction loans are guaranteed by the principals or general partners. At December 31, 2018, we had $146.6 million of construction and land development loans.
 Construction loan borrowers are generally pre-qualified for the permanent loan by us or a third party. We obtain a copy of the contract with the general contractor who must be acceptable to us. All plans, specifications and surveys must include proposed improvements. We review feasibility studies and risk analyses showing sensitivity of the project to variables such as interest rates, vacancy rates, lease rates and operating expenses.
 Commercial Business Lending
 These loans consist of lines of credit, revolving credit facilities, demand loans, term loans, equipment loans, SBA loans, stand-by letters of credit and unsecured loans. Commercial business loans are generally secured by accounts receivable, equipment, inventory and other collateral, such as readily marketable stocks and bonds with adequate margins, cash value in life insurance policies and savings and time deposits at Sonabank. At December 31, 2018, our commercial business loans totaled $255.4 million.
 In general, commercial business loans involve more credit risk than residential mortgage loans and real estate-backed commercial loans and, therefore, usually yield a higher return to us. The increased risk for commercial business loans is due to the type of collateral securing these loans. The increased risk also derives from the expectation that commercial loans will be serviced principally from the operations of the business, which may not be successful. Historical trends have shown that these types of loans have higher delinquencies than mortgage loans. Because of this, we often utilize the SBA 7(a) program (which guarantees the repayment of up to 90% of the principal and accrued interest to us) to reduce the inherent risk associated with commercial business lending.
 Another way that we reduce risk in the commercial loan portfolio is by taking accounts receivable as collateral using our SABL system. Our accounts receivable financing facilities, which provide a relatively high yield with considerable collateral control, are lines of credit under which a company can borrow up to the amount of a borrowing base which covers a certain percentage of the company’s receivables. From our customer’s point of view, accounts receivable financing is an efficient way to finance expanding operations because borrowing capacity expands as sales increase. Customers can borrow from 75% to 90% of qualified receivables. In most cases, the borrower’s customers pay us directly. For borrowers with a good track record for earnings and quality receivables, we will consider pricing based on an increment above the prime rate for transactions in which we lend up to a percentage of qualified outstanding receivables based on reported aging of the receivables portfolio.
 We also actively pursue for our customers equipment lease financing opportunities. We provide financing and use a third party to service the leases. Payment is derived from the cash flow of the borrower, so credit quality may not be any lower than it would be in the case of an unsecured loan for a similar amount and term.
 SBA Lending
 We have developed an expertise in the federally guaranteed SBA program. The SBA program is an economic development program which finances the expansion of small businesses. We are a Preferred Lender in the Washington, D.C. and Richmond, Virginia Districts of the SBA. As an SBA Preferred Lender, our pre-approved status allows us to quickly respond to customers’ needs. Under the SBA program, we originate and fund SBA 7(a) loans which qualify for guarantees up to 90% of principal and accrued interest. We also originate 504 chapter loans in which we generally provide 50% of the financing, taking a first lien on the real property as collateral.

 
  9

 

 We provide SBA loans to potential borrowers who are proposing a business venture, often with existing cash flow and a reasonable chance of success. We do not treat the SBA guarantee as a substitute for a borrower meeting our credit standards, and, except for minimum capital levels or maximum loan terms, the borrower must meet our other credit standards as applicable to loans outside the SBA process.
 Residential Mortgage Lending
 Permanent. Our business model generally does not include originating permanent residential mortgage loans. We originate such loans solely on a case-by-case basis. In the case of conventional loans, we typically lend up to 80% of the appraised value of single-family residences and require mortgage insurance for loans exceeding that amount. We have no sub-prime loans.
 On May 15, 2014, we purchased a 44% equity investment and preferred stock of STM, a regional mortgage banking company headquartered in Virginia Beach, Virginia. On June 23, 2017, in connection with the EVBS acquisition, we added 4.9% of additional equity investment and preferred stock in STM, bringing our total equity investment to 48.9%. STM has mortgage banking originators in Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Delaware. STM only originates retail mortgages.
 Sonabank has established with STM underwriting guidelines under which it will purchase residential construction only, construction loans that convert to permanent, and permanent loans primarily in its Virginia and Maryland footprint from STM. These are largely loans that do not conform to FNMA or FHLMC standards because of size or acreage. We purchased loans in an aggregate amount of $125.1 million from STM during 2018.
 We retain a valid lien on real estate and obtain a title insurance policy that ensures that the property is free of encumbrances. We also require hazard insurance and flood insurance for all loans secured by real property if the real property is in a flood plain as designated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. We also require most borrowers to advance funds on a monthly basis from which we make disbursements for items such as real estate taxes, private mortgage insurance and hazard insurance.
 Home Equity Lines of Credit (“HELOC”). Sonabank rarely originated HELOCs prior to our merger with EVBS. Since our merger with EVBS, HELOC’s are now a regular part of our business model. At December 31, 2018, we had outstanding HELOC balances totaling $128.2 million.
 Consumer Lending
 We offer various types of secured and unsecured consumer loans. We make consumer loans primarily for personal, family or household purposes as a convenience to our customer base since these loans are not the focus of our lending activities. As a general guideline, a consumer’s debt service should not exceed 40% of gross income or 45% of net income. For purposes of this calculation, debt includes house payment or rent, fixed installment payments, the estimated payment for the loan being requested and the minimum required payment on any revolving debt. At December 31, 2018, we had $32.3 million of consumer loans outstanding. Credit Approval and Collection Policies
 Because future loan losses are so closely intertwined with our underwriting policy, we have instituted what management believes is a stringent loan underwriting policy. Our underwriting guidelines are tailored for particular credit types, including lines of credit, revolving credit facilities, demand loans, term loans, equipment loans, real estate loans, SBA loans, stand-by letters of credit and unsecured loans. We will make extensions of credit based, among other factors, on the potential borrower’s creditworthiness, likelihood of repayment and proximity to market areas served.
 We have a standing Credit Committee comprised of certain officers, each of whom has a defined lending authority in combination with other officers. These individual lending authorities are determined by our Chief Executive Officer and certain directors and are based on the individual’s technical ability and experience. These lending authorities must be approved by our board of directors and our Credit Committee. Our Credit Committee is comprised of four levels of 

 
  10

 
members, based on experience: junior, regular, senior, and executive. Our Senior Executive members are Ms. Derrico, Mr. Porter and Mr. Shearin. Our Junior Executive members are Messrs. Baker and Brockwell. Mr. Stevens, Chief Credit Risk Officer, must approve risk ratings for loans over $1.5 million, as well as exceptions to the Credit Policy. Ms. Milne, Senior Credit Risk Officer must approve exceptions to Credit Policy for loans less than $1.5 million. Loans over a certain size must be approved by the full Board of Directors or the Credit Committee plus two outside directors. Under our loan approval process, the sponsoring loan officer’s approval is required on all credit submissions. This approval must be included in or added to the individual and joining authorities outlined below. The sponsoring loan officer is primarily responsible for the customer’s relationship with us, including, among other things, obtaining and maintaining adequate credit file information. We require each loan officer to maintain loan files in an order and detail that would enable a disinterested third party to review the file and determine the current status and quality of the credit.
 In addition to the approval of the sponsoring loan officer, we require approvals from one or more members of the Credit Committee on all loans. The approvals required differ based on the size of the borrowing relationship. At least one regular and one senior or executive member must approve loans up to $500 thousand. One regular, one senior and one executive member of the committee must approve all loans between $500 thousand and $1.0 million. One regular, one senior and two executive members must approve loans between $1.0 million and $6.0 million. All five executive members must approve loans over $6.0 million. Regardless of the number of approvals needed, we encourage each member not to rely on another member’s approval as a basis for approval and to treat his approval as if it were the only approval necessary to approve the loan. Our legal lending limit to one borrower is 15% of our unimpaired capital and surplus plus the allowance for loan losses. As of December 31, 2018, our legal lending limit was approximately $45.0 million. Our largest group credit as of December 31, 2018, was approximately $41.5 million.
 The following collection actions are the minimal procedures which management believes are necessary to properly monitor past due loans and leases. When a borrower fails to make a payment, we contact the borrower in person, in writing or on the telephone. At a minimum, all borrowers are notified by mail when payments of principal and/or interest are 10 days past due. Real estate and commercial loan borrowers are assessed a late charge when payments are 10‑15 days past due. Customers are contacted by a loan officer before the loan becomes 60 days delinquent. After 90 days, if the loan has not been brought current or an acceptable arrangement is not worked out with the borrower, we will institute measures to remedy the default, including commencing foreclosure action with respect to mortgage loans and repossessions of collateral in the case of consumer loans.
 If foreclosure is effected, the property is sold at a public auction in which we may participate as a bidder. If we are the successful bidder, we include the acquired real estate property in our real estate owned (“OREO”) account until it is sold. These assets are initially recorded at fair value net of estimated selling costs. To the extent there is a subsequent decline in fair value, that amount is charged to operating expense. At December 31, 2018, we had OREO totaling $5.1 million.
 Special Products and Services
 To complement our array of loans, we also provide the following special products and services to our commercial customers:

· | Employer Services: Sonabank will provide its business clients with software that allows them to generate ACH payroll transactions to their employees’ accounts.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | SABL: Asset Based Lending is a form of “collateral-based” lending. It is a combination of secured lending and short-term business lending. It is a specialized form of financing that allows a bank’s commercial customers to pledge their working assets, typically accounts receivable and, to a lesser extent, inventory, as collateral to secure financing. Asset Based Lending borrowers are typically in the service, manufacturing or distribution fields.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  SABL is an Asset Based Lending software system built by Sonabank that allows the Bank to monitor the collateral of its commercial borrowers who have pledged their working assets (accounts receivables and other qualifying assets such as inventory) as collateral. SABL has the ability to track other offsets (liabilities, e.g. other loans the customer has with the Bank) to the line of credit. SABL serves to provide the more stringent controls and supervision that this type of lending requires.
 One control that is typical of Asset Based Lending is that the commercial borrower is required to have its customers remit invoice payments to a bank controlled lockbox. The bank retrieves these payments and the bank applies them directly to any outstanding balance on the line. SABL allows for this and can combine that service with remote capture (Check 21) if warranted.
 Most Asset Based Lending systems are manual processes or software that certifies the borrowing base periodically. These certifications are usually provided in the form of manually created borrowing bases backed up with field exams. SABL provides a real time capability to analyze and adjust borrowing availability based on the levels of collateral at the moment.
 SABL also offers an automated collateral upload, taking receivable information directly from the clients accounting system. SABL also offers discretionary borrowings and pay offs, allowing clients to borrow on or pay down their line at their discretion, as long as they are compliant with the SABL system. Lastly, SABL offers superior reporting, offering

reports to bank officers that provide all the information they need to monitor risk. Customized reports can also be built for clients.

  Competition
 The banking business is highly competitive, and our profitability depends principally on our ability to compete in the market areas in which our banking operations are located. We experience substantial competition in attracting and retaining savings deposits and in lending funds. The primary factors we encounter in competing for savings deposits are convenient office locations and rates offered. Direct competition for savings deposits comes from other commercial bank and thrift institutions, money market mutual funds and corporate and government securities which may offer more attractive rates than insured depository institutions are willing to pay. The primary factors we encounter in competing for loans include, among others, interest rate and loan origination fees and the range of services offered. Competition for origination of loans normally comes from other commercial banks, thrift institutions, mortgage bankers, mortgage brokers, insurance companies and fintech or digital lending companies. We have been able to compete effectively with other financial institutions by:
· | emphasizing customer service and technology;
--+---------------------------------------------


· | establishing long-term customer relationships and building customer loyalty; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | providing products and services designed to address the specific needs of our customers.

 SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
 Bank holding companies and banks are extensively regulated under federal and state law.  This discussion is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions described below, and is not intended to be an exhaustive description of the statutes or regulations applicable to Southern National or the Bank. The business of Southern National and the Bank is subject to extensive regulation and supervision under federal and state law, including oversight by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve”) and the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions (“VBFI”), a regulatory division of the Virginia State Corporation Commission. 
     Changes in laws and regulations may alter the structure, regulation and competitive relationships of financial institutions. In addition, bank regulatory agencies may issue enforcement actions, policy statements, interpretive letters and similar written guidance applicable to us or the Bank.  It cannot be predicted whether and in what form new laws and regulations, or interpretations thereof, may be adopted or the extent to which the business of Southern National and the Bank may be affected thereby, but they may have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, and earnings. 
     Violations of laws and regulations, or other unsafe and unsound practices, may result in regulatory agencies imposing fines or penalties, cease and desist orders, or taking other enforcement actions. Under certain circumstances, these agencies may enforce these remedies directly against officers, directors, employees and other parties participating in the affairs of a bank or bank holding company. Under federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to the safety and soundness of insured depository institutions, federal and state banking regulators have the authority to compel or restrict certain actions on our part if they determine that we have insufficient capital or other resources, or are otherwise operating in a manner that may be deemed to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices. Under this authority, our bank regulators can require us or our subsidiaries to enter into informal or formal supervisory agreements, including board resolutions, memoranda of understanding, written agreements and consent or cease and desist orders, pursuant to which we would be required to take identified corrective actions to address cited concerns and to refrain from taking certain actions.
     If we become subject to and are unable to comply with the terms of any future regulatory actions or directives, supervisory agreements, or orders, then we could become subject to additional, heightened supervisory actions and orders, possibly including consent orders, prompt corrective action restrictions and/or other regulatory actions, including prohibitions on the payment of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock. If our regulators were to take such additional supervisory actions, then we could, among other things, become subject to significant restrictions on our ability to develop any new business, as well as restrictions on our existing business, and we could be required to raise additional capital, dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period of time, or both. The terms of any such supervisory action could have a material negative effect on our business, reputation, operating flexibility, financial condition, and the value of our common stock and preferred stock.
     Supervision, regulation, and examination of Southern National, the Bank, and our respective subsidiaries by the appropriate regulatory agencies, as described herein, are intended primarily for the protection of consumers, bank depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) of the FDIC, and the U.S. banking and financial system, rather than holders of our capital stock. 
 Bank Holding Company Regulation 
     Southern National is subject to extensive supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve System pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “Bank Holding Company Act”). We are required to file with the Federal Reserve periodic reports and such other information as the Federal Reserve may request.  Ongoing supervision is provided through regular examinations by the Federal Reserve and other means that allow the regulators to gauge management’s ability to identify, assess and control risk in all areas of operations in a safe and sound manner and to ensure compliance with laws and regulations. In addition to regulation by the Federal Reserve as a bank holding company, Southern National is subject to supervision and regulation by the VBFI under the banking and general business corporation laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia.

 Activity Limitations.  Southern National is registered with the Federal Reserve as a bank holding company. Bank holding companies generally are limited to the business of banking, managing or controlling banks, and other activities that the Federal Reserve determines to be closely related to banking, or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Bank holding companies are prohibited from acquiring or obtaining control of more than five percent (5%) of the outstanding voting interests of any company that engages in activities other than those activities permissible for bank holding companies. Examples of activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be permissible are making, acquiring, brokering, or servicing loans; leasing personal property; providing certain investment or financial advice; performing certain data processing services; acting as agent or broker in selling credit life insurance and other insurance products in certain locations; and performing certain insurance underwriting activities. The Bank Holding Company Act does not place geographic limits on permissible non-banking activities of bank holding companies. Even with respect to permissible activities, however, the Federal Reserve has the power to order a holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or its control of any subsidiary when the Federal Reserve has reasonable cause to believe that continuation of such activity or control of such subsidiary would pose a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary of that holding company. 
 Source of Strength Obligations.  A bank holding company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank and to maintain resources adequate to support its bank. The term “source of financial strength” means the ability of a company, such as us, that directly or indirectly owns or controls an insured depository institution, such as the Bank, to provide financial assistance to such insured depository institution in the event of financial distress.  The appropriate federal banking agency for the depository institution (in the case of the Bank, this agency is the FDIC) may require reports from us to assess our ability to serve as a source of strength and to enforce compliance with the source of strength requirements by requiring us to provide financial assistance to the Bank in the event of financial distress.  If we were to enter bankruptcy or become subject to the orderly liquidation process established by the Dodd-Frank Act, any commitment by us to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of the Bank would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee or the FDIC, as appropriate, and entitled to a priority of payment. In addition, the FDIC provides that any insured depository institution generally will be liable for any loss incurred by the FDIC in connection with the default of, or any assistance provided by the FDIC to, a commonly controlled insured depository institution. The Bank is an FDIC-insured depository institution and thus subject to these requirements.
     Acquisitions. The Bank Holding Company Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve or waiver of such prior approval before it (1) acquires ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if, after such acquisition, such bank holding company will own or control more than five percent (5%) of the voting shares of such bank, (2) acquires all of the assets of a bank, or (3) merges with any other bank holding company. In reviewing a proposed covered acquisition, among other factors, the Federal Reserve considers (1) the financial and managerial resources of the companies involved, including pro forma capital ratios; (2) the risk to the stability of the United States banking or financial system; (3) the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including performance under the CRA; and (4) the effectiveness of the companies in combatting money laundering. The Federal Reserve also reviews any indebtedness to be incurred by a bank holding company in connection with a proposed acquisition to ensure that the bank holding company can service such indebtedness without adversely affecting its ability to serve as a source of strength to its bank subsidiaries.  Well capitalized and well managed bank holding companies are permitted to acquire control of banks in any state, subject to federal regulatory approval, without regard to whether such a transaction is prohibited by the laws of any state. However, a bank holding company may not, following an interstate acquisition, control more than 10% of nationwide insured deposits or 30% of deposits within any state in which the acquiring bank operates. Federal banking regulators are also required to take into account compliance with the CRA in evaluating any proposal for interstate bank acquisitions.
     Change in Control. Federal law restricts the amount of voting stock of a bank holding company or a bank that a person may acquire without the prior approval of banking regulators. Under the federal Change in Bank Control Act and the regulations thereunder, a person or group must give advance notice to and obtain approval from the Federal Reserve before acquiring control of any bank holding company, such as Southern National. The Change in Bank Control Act creates a rebuttable presumption of control if a member or group acquires a certain percentage or more of a bank holding company’s voting stock, or if one or more other control factors are present. As a result, a person or entity generally must provide prior notice to the Federal Reserve before acquiring the power to vote 10% or more of our outstanding common stock.

     Virginia Law. Certain state corporation laws may have an anti-takeover affect. Virginia law restricts transactions between a Virginia corporation and its affiliates and potential acquirers. The following discussion summarizes the two Virginia statutes that may discourage an attempt to acquire control of Southern National.
 Virginia Code Sections 13.1‑725 – 727.1 govern “Affiliated Transactions.” These provisions, with several exceptions discussed below, require approval by the holders of at least two-thirds of the remaining voting shares of material acquisition transactions between a Virginia corporation and any holder of more than 10% of any class of its outstanding voting shares. Affiliated Transactions include mergers, share exchanges, material dispositions of corporate assets not in the ordinary course of business, any dissolution of the corporation proposed by or on behalf of an interested shareholder, or any reclassification, including a reverse stock split, recapitalization, or merger of the corporation with its subsidiaries which increases the percentage of voting shares owned beneficially by any 10% shareholder by more than 5%.
 These provisions were designed to deter certain takeovers of Virginia corporations. In addition, the statute provides that, by affirmative vote of a majority of the voting shares other than shares owned by any 10% shareholder, a corporation can adopt an amendment to its articles of incorporation or bylaws providing that the Affiliated Transactions provisions shall not apply to the corporation. Southern National “opted out” of the Affiliated Transactions provisions when it incorporated.
 Virginia law also provides that shares acquired in a transaction that would cause the acquiring person’s voting strength to meet or exceed any of the three thresholds (20%, 33 1/3% or 50%) have no voting rights for those shares exceeding that threshold, unless granted by a majority vote of shares not owned by the acquiring person. This provision empowers an acquiring person to require the Virginia corporation to hold a special meeting of shareholders to consider the matter within 50 days of the request. Southern National also “opted out” of this provision at the time of its incorporation.
 Governance and Financial Reporting Obligations. We are required to comply with various corporate governance and financial reporting requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules and regulations adopted by the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and NASDAQ. In particular, we are required to include management and independent registered public accounting firm reports on internal controls as part of our Annual Report on Form 10-K in order to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We have evaluated our controls, including compliance with the SEC rules on internal controls, and have and expect to continue to spend significant amounts of time and money on compliance with these rules. Our failure to comply with these internal control rules may materially adversely affect our reputation, ability to obtain the necessary certifications to financial statements, and the values of our securities.
     Corporate Governance.  The Dodd-Frank Act addresses many investor protections, corporate governance, and executive compensation matters that will affect most U.S. publicly traded companies. The Dodd-Frank Act (1) grants shareholders of U.S. publicly traded companies an advisory vote on executive compensation; (2) enhances independence requirements for Compensation Committee members; and (3) requires companies listed on national securities exchanges to adopt incentive-based compensation claw-back policies for executive officers.
     Incentive Compensation. The Dodd-Frank Act required the banking agencies and the SEC to establish joint rules or guidelines for financial institutions with more than $1.0 billion in assets, such as Southern National and the Bank, which prohibit incentive compensation arrangements that the agencies determine to encourage inappropriate risks by the institution. The banking agencies issued proposed rules in 2011 and previously issued guidance on sound incentive compensation policies. In 2016, the Federal Reserve also proposed rules that would, depending upon the assets of the institution, directly regulate incentive compensation arrangements and would require enhanced oversight and recordkeeping. As of December 31, 2018, these rules have not been implemented. We and Sonabank have undertaken efforts to ensure that our incentive compensation plans do not encourage inappropriate risks, consistent with three key principles—that incentive compensation arrangements should appropriately balance risk and financial rewards, be compatible with effective controls and risk management, and be supported by strong corporate governance.
     Shareholder Say-On-Pay Votes. The Dodd-Frank Act requires public companies to take shareholders’ votes on proposals addressing compensation (known as say-on-pay), the frequency of a say-on-pay vote, and the golden 

 
  16

 
parachutes available to executives in connection with change-in-control transactions. Public companies must give shareholders the opportunity to vote on the compensation at least every three years and the opportunity to vote on frequency at least every six years, indicating whether the say-on-pay vote should be held annually, biennially, or triennially.
     Anti-tying rules. A bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tying arrangements in connection with extensions of credit, leases or sales of property, or furnishing of services. 
     Capital Requirements 
     The Bank is required under federal law to maintain certain minimum capital levels based on ratios of capital to total assets and capital to risk-weighted assets. The required capital ratios are minimums, and the federal banking agencies may determine that a banking organization, based on its size, complexity or risk profile, must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner. Risks such as concentration of credit risks and the risk arising from non-traditional activities, as well as the institution’s exposure to a decline in the economic value of its capital due to changes in interest rates, and an institution’s ability to manage those risks are important factors that are to be taken into account by the federal banking agencies in assessing an institution’s overall capital adequacy. The following is a brief description of the relevant provisions of these capital rules and their potential impact on our capital levels.
 The Bank is subject to the following risk-based capital ratios: a common equity Tier 1 ("CET1") risk-based capital ratio, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, which includes CET1 and additional Tier 1 capital, and a total capital ratio, which includes Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital.  CET1 is primarily comprised of the sum of common stock instruments and related surplus net of treasury stock, retained earnings, and certain qualifying minority interests, less certain adjustments and deductions, including with respect to goodwill, intangible assets, mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets subject to temporary timing differences. Additional Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, tier 1 minority interests and grandfathered trust preferred securities. Tier 2 capital consists of instruments disqualified from Tier 1 capital, including qualifying subordinated debt, other preferred stock and certain hybrid capital instruments, and a limited amount of loan loss reserves up to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, subject to certain eligibility criteria. The capital rules also define the risk-weights assigned to assets and off-balance sheet items to determine the risk-weighted asset components of the risk-based capital rules, including, for example, certain “high volatility” commercial real estate, past due assets, structured securities and equity holdings. 
 The leverage capital ratio, which serves as a minimum capital standard, is the ratio of Tier 1 capital to quarterly average assets net of goodwill, certain other intangible assets, and certain required deduction items. The required minimum leverage ratio for all banks is 4%.
 In addition, the capital rules require a capital conservation buffer of up to 2.5% above each of the minimum capital ratio requirements (CET1, Tier 1, and total risk-based capital), which is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress.  These buffer requirements must be met for a bank to be able to pay dividends, engage in share buybacks or make discretionary bonus payments to executive management without restriction. This capital conservation buffer is being phased in, and was 1.875% as of January 1, 2018 and is 2.5% effective January 1, 2019.  
 Failure to be well-capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have an adverse material effect on our operations or financial condition. For example, only a well-capitalized depository institution may accept brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval. Failure to be well-capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could also result in restrictions on the Bank’s ability to pay dividends or otherwise distribute capital or to receive regulatory approval of applications or other restrictions on its growth. 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”), among other things, requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to take “prompt corrective action” regarding depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five regulatory capital tiers: “well capitalized”, “adequately capitalized”, “undercapitalized”, “significantly undercapitalized”, and “critically undercapitalized”. A depository institution’s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various relevant capital measures and certain 

 
  17

 
other factors, as established by regulation. FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. The FDICIA imposes progressively more restrictive restraints on operations, management and capital distributions, depending on the category in which an institution is classified.  Undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the Federal Reserve System. In addition, undercapitalized depository institutions may not accept brokered deposits absent a waiver from the FDIC, are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans for regulatory approval. A depository institution's holding company must guarantee any required capital restoration plan, up to an amount equal to the lesser of 5 percent of the depository institution's assets at the time it becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency when the institution fails to comply with the plan. Federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution's capital. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. All of the federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted regulations establishing relevant capital measures and relevant capital levels for federally insured depository institutions. The Bank was well capitalized at December 31, 2018, and brokered deposits are not restricted.
 To be well-capitalized, the Bank must maintain at least the following capital ratios:
    
· | 6.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets;
--+-----------------------------------


· | 8.0% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets;
--+---------------------------------------------


· | 10.0% Total capital to risk-weighted assets; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | 5.0% leverage ratio.
--+---------------------

      The Bank’s regulatory capital ratios were above the applicable well-capitalized standards and met the then-applicable capital conservation buffer. Based on current estimates, we believe that the Bank will continue to exceed all applicable well-capitalized regulatory capital requirements and the capital conservation buffer in 2019.   
 The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the “Economic Growth Act”) signed into law in May 2018 scaled back certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and provided other regulatory relief. Among the provisions of the Economic Growth Act was a requirement that the Federal Reserve raise the asset threshold for those bank holding companies subject to the Federal Reserve’s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement (“Policy Statement”) to $3.0 billion.  As a result, as of the effective date of that change in 2018, Southern National was no longer required to comply with the risk-based capital rules applicable to the Bank as described above. The Federal Reserve may however, require smaller bank holding companies subject to the Policy Statement to maintain certain minimum capital levels, depending upon general economic conditions and a bank holding company’s particular condition, risk profile and growth plans.

 Payment of Dividends
     Southern National is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and other subsidiaries.  Its primary source of cash, other than securities offerings, is dividends from the Bank. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, no dividends may be paid by an insured bank if the bank is in arrears in the payment of any insurance assessment due to the FDIC.  The payment of dividends by the Bank may also be affected by other regulatory requirements and policies, such as the maintenance of adequate capital. If, in the opinion of the applicable regulatory authority, a bank under its jurisdiction is engaged in, or is about to engage in, an unsafe or unsound practice (which, depending on the financial condition of the bank, could include the payment of dividends), such authority may require, after notice and hearing, that such bank cease and desist from such practice. The FDIC has formal and informal policies which provide that insured banks should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings.
     Under a Federal Reserve policy adopted in 2009, the board of directors of a bank holding company must consider certain factors to ensure that its dividend level is prudent relative to maintaining a strong financial position, and is not based on overly optimistic earnings scenarios, such as potential events that could affect its ability to pay, while still maintaining a strong financial position. As a general matter, the Federal Reserve has indicated that the board of directors of a bank holding company should consult with the Federal Reserve and eliminate, defer or significantly reduce the bank holding company’s dividends if: 
    
· | its net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | its prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with its capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | it will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Bank Regulation 
     The operation of the Bank is subject to state and federal statutes applicable to state banks and the regulations of the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). The operations of the Bank may also be subject to applicable Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) regulation to the extent state banks are granted parity with national banks. Such statutes and regulations relate to, among other things, required reserves, investments, loans, mergers and consolidations, issuances of securities, payments of dividends, establishment of branches, consumer protection and other aspects of the Bank’s operations. Violations of laws and regulations, or other unsafe and unsound practices, may result in these agencies imposing fines or penalties, cease and desist orders, or taking other enforcement actions.  Under certain circumstances, these agencies may enforce these remedies directly against officers, directors, employees and other parties participating in the affairs of a bank or bank holding company.
     Safety and Soundness. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act requires the federal prudential bank regulatory agencies, such as the Federal Reserve, to prescribe, by regulation or guideline, operational and managerial standards for all insured depository institutions relating to: (1) internal controls; (2) information systems and audit systems; (3) loan documentation; (4) credit underwriting; (5) interest rate risk exposure; and (6) asset quality. The agencies also must prescribe standards for asset quality, earnings, and stock valuation, as well as standards for compensation, fees and benefits. The federal banking agencies have adopted regulations and Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement these required standards. These guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards used to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. Under the regulations, if a regulator determines that a bank fails to meet any standards prescribed by the guidelines, the regulator may require the bank to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance, consistent with deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans.
     Examinations. The Bank is subject to regulation, reporting, and periodic examinations by the Federal Reserve and the VBFI. These regulatory authorities routinely examine the Bank’s reserves, loan and investment quality, consumer compliance, management policies, procedures and practices and other aspects of operations. The Federal Reserve has adopted the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council’s (“FFIEC”) rating system and assigns each financial 

 
  19

 
institution a confidential composite rating based on an evaluation and rating of six essential components of an institution’s financial condition and operations, including Capital Adequacy, Asset Quality, Management, Earnings, Liquidity and Sensitivity to Market Risk, as well as the quality of risk management practices.  
     Consumer Protection. The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB, an independent regulatory authority housed within the Federal Reserve having centralized authority, including examination and enforcement authority, for consumer protection in the banking industry.  The CFPB has rule writing, examination, and enforcement authority with regard to the Bank’s (and the Company’s) compliance with a wide array of consumer financial protection laws, including the Truth in Lending Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the S.A.F.E. Mortgage Licensing Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act (except Sections 615(e) and 628), the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (sections 502 through 509 relating to privacy), among others. The CFPB has broad authority to enforce a prohibition on unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practice.  In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are stricter than those regulations promulgated by the CFPB, and state attorneys general are permitted to enforce consumer protection rules adopted by the CFPB against certain institutions.
     Branching. The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes national and state banks to establish de novo branches in other states to the same extent a bank chartered in those states would be so permitted. 
     Deposit Insurance Assessments. The Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) of the FDIC insures the deposits of the Bank generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category.  The FDIC charges insured depository institutions quarterly premiums to maintain the DIF.  Deposit insurance assessments are based on average total consolidated assets minus its average tangible equity, and take into account certain risk-based financial ratios and other factors. In addition, in 2018 the Bank was subject to quarterly assessments by the FDIC to pay interest on Financing Corporation ("FICO") bonds.
     Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.  The Bank does not believe that it is taking or is subject to any action, condition or violation that could lead to termination of its deposit insurance.  In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that, in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution, including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors, and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution, including those of the parent bank holding company.
     Insider Transactions. In addition to regulating capital, the Federal Reserve has broad authority to prevent the development or continuance of unsafe or unsound banking practices. Pursuant to this authority, the Federal Reserve has adopted regulations that restrict preferential loans and loan amounts to “affiliates” and “insiders” of banks, require banks to keep information on loans to major shareholders and executive officers and bar certain director and officer interlocks between financial institutions. 
     Reserves. The Bank is subject to Federal Reserve regulations that require the Bank to maintain reserves against transaction accounts (primarily checking accounts). These reserve requirements are subject to annual adjustment by the Federal Reserve.
     Anti-Money Laundering.  Under the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (“USA PATRIOT”) Act of 2001, financial institutions are subject to prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships as well as enhanced due diligence and “know your customer” standards in their dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers. The USA PATRIOT Act requires financial institutions to establish anti-money laundering programs with minimum standards that include:
    
· | the development of internal policies, procedures, and controls;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


· | the designation of a compliance officer;
--+-----------------------------------------


· | an ongoing employee training program; and
--+------------------------------------------

 
 
  20

 


· | an independent audit function to test the programs.
--+----------------------------------------------------

      Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these anti-money laundering obligations and recently have been active in imposing “cease and desist” and other regulatory orders and money penalty sanctions against institutions found to be in violation of these requirements.  In addition, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network has adopted new regulations that became effective on May 11, 2018, that require, subject to certain exclusions and exemptions, covered financial institutions to identify and verify the identity of beneficial owners of legal entity customers.
     Economic Sanctions. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) is responsible for helping to ensure that U.S. entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties, as defined by various Executive Orders and acts of Congress.  OFAC publishes, and routinely updates, lists of names of persons and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, including the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List.  If we find a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, we must undertake certain specified activities, which could include blocking or freezing the account or transaction requested, and we must notify the appropriate authorities.
 Concentrations in Lending.  During 2006, the federal bank regulatory agencies released guidance on “Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending” (the “Guidance”) and advised financial institutions of the risks posed by CRE lending concentrations. The Guidance requires that appropriate processes be in place to identify, monitor and control risks associated with real estate lending concentrations. Higher allowances for loan losses and capital levels may also be required. The Guidance is triggered when CRE loan concentrations exceed either:

 Community Reinvestment Act.  The Bank is subject to the provisions of the CRA, which imposes a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with their safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of entire communities where the bank accepts deposits, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The Federal Reserve’s assessment of the Bank’s CRA record is made available to the public. Further, a less than satisfactory CRA rating will slow, if not preclude, expansion of banking activities and prevent a company from becoming or remaining a financial holding company. Federal CRA regulations require, among other things, that evidence of discrimination against applicants on a prohibited basis, and illegal or abusive lending practices be considered in the CRA evaluation. The Bank has a rating of “Satisfactory” in its most recent CRA evaluation.
 Consumer Regulation. Activities of the Bank are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers. These laws and regulations include, among numerous other things, provisions that:

· | limit the interest and other charges collected or contracted for by the Bank, including rules respecting the terms of credit cards and of debit card overdrafts;

 Mortgage Rules. Pursuant to rules adopted by the CFPB, banks that make residential mortgage loans are required to make a good faith determination that a borrower has the ability to repay a mortgage loan prior to extending such credit, require that certain mortgage loans contain escrow payments, obtain new appraisals under certain circumstances, comply with integrated mortgage disclosure rules, and follow specific rules regarding the compensation of loan originators and the servicing of residential mortgage loans. 
     Transactions with affiliates. There are various restrictions that limit the ability of the Bank to finance, pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to the Company or other affiliates. In addition, banks are subject to certain restrictions under Section 23A and B of the Federal Reserve Act on certain transactions, including any extension of credit to its bank holding company or any of its other affiliates, on investments in the securities thereof, and on the taking of such securities as collateral for loans to any borrower. 
     Privacy and Cybersecurity. The Bank is subject to federal and state banking regulations that limit its ability to disclose non-public information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties. These limitations require us to periodically disclose our privacy policies to consumers and allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a non-affiliated third party under certain circumstances.  Consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services.  Banking institutions are required to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information.  These security and privacy policies and procedures for the protection of confidential and personal information are in effect across our lines of business.  Furthermore, the federal banking regulators regularly issue guidance regarding cybersecurity intended to enhance cyber risk management. A financial institution is expected to implement multiple lines of defense against cyber attacks and ensure that their risk management procedures address the risk posed by potential cyber threats.  A financial institution is further expected to maintain procedures to effectively respond to a cyber attack and resume operations following any such attack.  The Company has adopted and implemented policies and procedures to comply with these privacy, information security, and cybersecurity requirements.  
     Debit Interchange Fees. Interchange fees, or “swipe” fees, are fees that merchants pay to credit card companies and card-issuing banks such as the Bank for processing electronic payment transactions on their behalf. The maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction is the sum of 21 cents per transaction and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction, subject to an upward adjustment of 1 cent if an issuer certifies that it has implemented policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve the fraud-prevention standards set forth by the Federal Reserve. In addition, the legislation prohibits card issuers and networks from entering into arrangements requiring that debit card transactions be processed on a single network or only two affiliated networks, and allows merchants to determine transaction routing. 
     Audit Reports. Insured institutions with total assets of $500 million or more must submit annual audit reports prepared by independent auditors to federal and state regulators. In some instances, the audit report of the institution’s holding company can be used to satisfy this requirement. Independent auditors must receive examination reports, supervisory agreements and reports of enforcement actions. For insured institutions with total assets of $1.0 billion or more, financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management’s certifications concerning responsibility for the financial statements, internal controls and compliance with legal requirements designated by the FDIC, and an attestation by the independent auditor regarding the statements of management relating to the internal controls must be submitted. For insured institutions with total assets of more than $3.0 billion, independent auditors may be required to review quarterly financial statements. The FDICIA requires that institutions with total assets of $1.0 billion or more have independent audit committees, consisting of outside directors only. The committees of insured institutions with total assets of $3.0 billion or more must include members with experience in banking or financial management, must have access to outside counsel, and must not include representatives of large customers.
 The foregoing is only a brief summary of certain statutes, rules, and regulations that may affect Southern National and the Bank. Numerous other statutes and regulations also will have an impact on the operations of Southern National and the Bank. Supervision, regulation and examination of banks by the regulatory agencies are intended primarily for the protection of depositors, not shareholders.
