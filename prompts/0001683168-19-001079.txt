Item 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.
 
History of the Business
 
Legacy Card Company (“Legacy”) was formed as a Limited Liability Company on August 29, 2001. On April 18, 2005, Legacy converted from a California Limited Liability Company to a Nevada Corporation. On November 10, 2005, Legacy merged with Cardiff Lexington Corp (formerly Cardiff International, Inc.) (“Cardiff”, the “Company”), a publicly held corporation in Colorado. On August 27, 2014 Cardiff redomiciled to Florida.
 
In the first quarter of 2013, it was decided to restructure Cardiff into a holding company enabling businesses to take advantage of the power of a public company. Cardiff began targeting the acquisition of undervalued, niche companies with high growth potential, income-producing commercial real estate properties, and high return investments, all designed to pay a dividend to our shareholders. The reason for this strategy was to protect our shareholders by acquiring profitable small- to minimum-sized businesses with little to no debt, seeking support with both financing and management that had the ability to offer a return to investors. The plan is to establish new classes of preferred stock to streamline voting rights, negate debt, and acquire new businesses. By December 31, 2018, we have acquired eight (8) businesses: We Three (AHI); Romeo’s NY Pizza; Edge View Properties; Repiici’s Franchise Group; Refreshment Concepts; FDR Enterprises; Red Rock Travel Group and Platinum Tax Defenders. Cardiff currently has two potential new acquisitions pending.

Current Business Operations
 
Cardiff is a public holding company, much like a cooperative, leveraging proven management in private companies that become subsidiaries under our umbrella. Our focus is not based on a specific industry or geographic location, but rather on a proven management, market, and historical operating margin. We target acquisitions of mature, high growth, niche companies. Cardiff’s strategy identifies and empowers select income-producing middle market private businesses and commercial real estate properties.
 
The target company’s management team typically maintains control of the day to day operations. Acquisitions become standalone autonomous subsidiaries that gain the advantages of a publicly traded company without losing their independent management control. Management enjoys the advantage of improved valuation, liquidity, synergies, and support, along with diversification and asset appreciation through collective subsidiary performance. Diversification and pooled resources leverage value and mitigate risk.
 
Cardiff provides these companies both 1) the enhanced ability to raise money for operations or expansion, and 2) an equity exit and liquidity strategy for the owner, heirs, and/or Investors.
 
For investors, Cardiff provides a diversified lower risk to protect and safely enhance their investment by continually adding assets and holdings.
 
Cardiff employs a merge, acquire, and hold strategy to maximize value and potential of private, often family run, enterprises while providing diversification and risk mitigation for all shareholders.
 
Cardiff is led by strong and talented roster of executives and advisors providing expert acquisition, market guidance and added value for subsidiaries and investors. To date, Cardiff consists of the following whole-owned subsidiaries:
 
We Three, LLC (Affordable Housing Initiative); Romeo’s NY Pizza (merged Fortuna Restaurant Group and R & T Restaurant Group into Romeo’s Alpharetta); Edge View Properties, Inc; Repicci’s Franchise Group, Inc. (merged Refreshment Concepts, LLC into Repicci’s Franchise Group, Inc.); FDR Enterprises, Inc .; Red Rock Travel Group, LLC and Platinum Tax Defenders, LLC.
 
Organization
 
We are now comprised as one parent corporation holding company and seven operating subsidiaries.
 
Employees
 
Collectively, Cardiff and its subsidiaries employ approximately 70 employees and anticipates hiring additional personal with new acquisitions.
 
Competition
 
We are a Small Cap holding company enabling businesses to take advantage of the power of a public company. Cardiff began targeting the acquisition of undervalued, niche companies with high growth potential, income-producing commercial real estate properties, and high return investments, all designed to pay a dividend to our shareholders. The reason for this strategy was to protect our shareholders by acquiring profitable small- to minimum-sized businesses with little to no debt, seeking support with both financing and management that had the ability to offer a return to investors. The plan is to establish new classes of preferred stock to streamline voting rights, negate debt, and acquire new businesses.
