ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview – SINTX Technologies
 
We are a biomaterials company focused on providing ceramic based biomaterial solutions in a variety of medical and industrial applications. To date, our primary focus has been the research, development and commercialization of medical implant products manufactured with silicon nitride. We believe that silicon nitride has a superb combination of properties that make it ideally suited for long-term human implantation. Other biomaterials are based on bone grafts, metal alloys, and polymers- all of which have well-known practical limitations and disadvantages. In contrast, silicon nitride has a legacy of success in the most demanding and extreme industrial environments. As a human implant material, silicon nitride offers bone ingrowth, resistance to bacterial and viral infection, ease of diagnostic imaging, resistance to corrosion, and superior strength and fracture resistance, among other advantages, all of which claims are validated in our large and growing inventory of peer-reviewed, published literature reports. We believe that our versatile silicon nitride manufacturing expertise positions us favorably to introduce new and innovative devices in the medical and non-medical fields.
 
We also believe that we are the first and only company to commercialize silicon nitride medical implants. Prior to October 1, 2018, we designed, manufactured and commercialized silicon nitride products for our own behalf in the spine implant market. Over 33,000 of our spinal implants manufactured with silicon nitride have been implanted into patients, with an excellent safety record. On October 1, 2018, we sold our spine implant business to CTL Medical and now manufacture spine implants made with silicon nitride for CTL Medical. Prior to selling our spine implant business to CTL Medical, we had received 510(k) regulatory clearance in the United States, a CE mark in Europe, ANVISA approval in Brazil, and ARTG and Prostheses approvals in Australia for a number of silicon nitride spine implant products designed for spinal fusion surgery. Spine implant products manufactured by us from silicon nitride are currently marketed and sold by CTL Medical under the Valeo® brand to surgeons and hospitals in the United States and to selected markets in Europe and South America. These implants are designed for use in cervical (neck) and thoracolumbar (lower back) spine surgery. We are collaborating with CTL Medical to establish a commercial partner in Australia and also working with other partners to obtain regulatory approval for silicon nitride implants in Japan.
 
The sale of our spine implant business to CTL Medical enables us to now focus on our core competencies. These are research and development of silicon nitride and the design and manufacture of medical and nonmedical products manufactured from silicon nitride and other ceramic materials for our own account and in collaboration with other medical device manufacturers. We are targeting original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) – including CTL Medical - and private label partnerships in order to accelerate adoption of silicon nitride in future markets such as coating products with silicon nitride, hip and knee replacements, dental and maxillofacial implants, extremities, trauma, and sports medicine. Existing biomaterials, based on plastics, metals, and bone grafts have well-recognized limitations that we believe are addressed by silicon nitride, and we are uniquely positioned to convert existing, successful implant designs made by other companies into products manufactured with silicon nitride. OEM and private label partnerships allow us to work with a variety of partners, accelerate the adoption of silicon nitride, and realize incremental revenue at improved operating margins, when compared to the cost-intensive direct sales model.
 
We believe that silicon nitride addresses many of the biomaterial-related limitations in fields such as hip and knee replacements, dental and maxillofacial implants, sports medicine, extremities, and trauma surgery. We further believe that the inherent material properties of silicon nitride, and the ability to formulate the material in a variety of compositions, combined with precise control of the surface properties of the material, opens up a number of commercial opportunities across orthopedic surgery, neurological surgery, maxillofacial surgery, and other medical disciplines.
 
We operate a 30,000 square foot manufacturing facility at our corporate headquarters in Salt Lake City, Utah, and we believe we are the only vertically integrated silicon nitride medical device manufacturer in the world.

Overview - Biomaterials
 
Biomaterials are natural or synthetic biocompatible materials that are used in virtually every medical specialty to improve or preserve body functionality. Various types of biomaterials are used as essential components in medical devices, drug delivery systems, replacement and tissue repair technologies, prostheses, and diagnostic technologies.
 
There are four general categories of biomaterials:
 

● | Ceramics. Ceramics are hard, non-metallic, non-corrosive, heat-resistant materials made by shaping and then applying high temperatures. Traditional ceramics commonly used as biomaterials include carbon, oxides of aluminum, zirconium and titanium, calcium phosphate and zirconia-toughened alumina. Examples of medical uses of ceramics include repair, augmentation or stabilization of fractured bones, bone and joint replacements, spinal fusion devices, dental implants and restorations, heart valves and surgical instruments. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Metals. Metals commonly used as biomaterials include titanium, stainless steel, cobalt, chrome, gold, silver and platinum, and alloys of these metals. Examples of medical uses of metals include the repair or stabilization of fractured bones, stents, surgical instruments, bone and joint replacements, spinal fusion devices, dental implants and restorations and heart valves. 
● | Natural biomaterials. Natural biomaterials are derived from human donors, animal or plant sources and include human bone, collagen, gelatin, cellulose, chitin, alginate and hyaluronic acid. Examples of medical uses of natural biomaterials include the addition or substitution of hard and soft tissue, cornea protectors, vascular grafts, repair and replacement of tendons and ligaments, bone and joint replacements, spinal fusion devices, dental restorations and heart valves. 
● | Polymers. Polymers are synthetic compounds consisting of similar molecules linked together that can be created to have specific properties. Polymers commonly used as biomaterials include nylon, silicon rubber, polyester, polyethylene, cross-linked polyethylene (a stronger version), polymethylmethacrylate, polyvinyl chloride and polyetheretherketone – which is commonly referred to as PEEK. Examples of medical uses of polymers include soft-tissue replacement, sutures, drug delivery systems, joint replacements, spinal fusion devices and dental restorations. 

Our Silicon Nitride Technology Platform
 
We believe we are the only FDA-cleared and ISO 13485 certified silicon nitride medical device manufacturing facility in the world, and the only provider of structural ceramics-based medical devices used for spinal fusion applications. Silicon nitride is a chemical compound comprised of the elements silicon and nitrogen, with the chemical formula Si3N4. Silicon nitride, an advanced ceramic, is lightweight, resistant to fracture and strong, and is used in many demanding mechanical, thermal and wear applications, such as in space shuttle bearings, jet engine components and body armor.


We believe our silicon nitride is ideal as an implant material and is superior to other biomaterials currently used in the market such as PEEK, allograft and autograft bone, metal and traditional oxide ceramics, none of which possess all of the favorable characteristics of silicon nitride:
 

● | Promotes Bone Growth. Our silicon nitride is osteointegrative through its inherent surface topography and surface chemistry. The surface topography provides scaffolding for new bone growth. As a hydrophilic material, silicon nitride attracts protein cells and nutrients that stimulate osteoprogenitor cells to differentiate into osteoblasts, which are needed for optimal bone growth environments. Our silicon nitride has an inherent surface chemistry that favors bone formation and healing, much more so than PEEK and metals. These properties were highlighted in an in vivo study, where we measured the force required to separate devices from the spine after being implanted for three months, which indicates the quality of osteointegration. In the absence of bacteria, the force required to separate our silicon nitride from its surrounding bone was approximately three times that of PEEK, and nearly two times that of titanium. In the presence of bacteria, the force required to separate our silicon nitride from its surrounding bone was over five times that of titanium, while there was effectively no separation force required for PEEK, indicating essentially no osteointegration in a septic environment. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Antibacterial. We have demonstrated in in vitro and in vivo studies that silicon nitride has inherent surface antibacterial properties, which reduce the risk of bacterial infection and biofilm in and around a silicon nitride device. PEEK, traditional ceramics, metals and bone do not have this bacterial resistance. These properties were highlighted in an in vitro study (Acta Biomater. 2012 Dec;8(12):4447-54. doi: 10.1016/j.actbio.2012.07.038. Epub 2012 Jul 31.), where live bacteria counts were between 8 and 30 times lower on our silicon nitride than PEEK and up to 8 times lower on our silicon nitride than titanium. In addition to improving patient outcomes, we believe the antibacterial properties of our silicon nitride should make it an attractive biomaterial to hospitals and surgeons who are not reimbursed by third-party payers for the treatment of acute, implant-related infections. Additionally, silicon nitride is synthetic and, therefore, there is a lower risk of disease transmission through cross-contamination or of an adverse auto-immune response, sometimes associated with the use of allograft bone. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Antiviral: Solid-surface inactivation of microbial pathogens has ancient roots; the Smith Papyrus (2600~2200 B.C.) described the use of copper surfaces to sterilize chest wounds and drinking water. Today, brass and bronze on door-knobs help prevent microbial spread in hospitals, and metal particles and surface coatings of selected metals are used in hygiene-sensitive environments, both as inactivators and adjuvants in inducing cellular immunity. Cellular toxicity limits these approaches because while the reactive oxygen radicals generated at metal surfaces efficiently kill bacteria and viruses, they also damage cells by oxidizing their proteins and lipids. Recent data have shown that silicon nitride surfaces are effective against several types of viruses. With surface-contact transmission of viral pathogens, particularly influenza, and the increasing use of consumer touchscreens in various retail industries, we believe that our material has value to OEM partners focused on consumer glass-based surface coatings and treatments. We have filed a U.S. patent application on this effect. 
● | Antifungal: We have conducted preliminary studies which suggest that our silicon nitride may be effective against fungal microbes. Plant-based viruses, bacteria, and fungi affect some 15% of the world’s edible crops, or about 1 billion metric tons of edible produce annually, with an economic impact in the US and Canada alone estimated to be between $1.5 to $5 Billion per year. The mycotoxins produced by these plant fungi have an overall negative impact on human health and longevity. The inorganic nature of silicon nitride may prove to be more beneficial than the use of petrochemical or organometallic fungicides which are known to have residual effects in soil, on plants, and in fruit. Our goal is to identify industry partners who have interest in this technology, and potentially spin-off this agribusiness segment of our business, with SINTX Technologies as an OEM supplier. 
● | Imaging Compatible. Our silicon nitride interbody spinal fusion devices are semi-radiolucent, clearly visible in X-rays, and produce no distortion under MRI and no scattering under CT. These characteristics enable an exact view of the device for precise intra-operative placement and post-operative bone fusion assessment in spinal fusion procedures. These qualities provide surgeons with greater certainty of outcomes with our silicon nitride devices than with other biomaterials, such as PEEK and metals. 
● | Hard, Strong and Resistant to Fracture. Our silicon nitride is hard, strong and possesses superior resistance to fracture over traditional ceramics and greater strength than polymers currently on the market. For example, our silicon nitride’s flexural strength is more than five times that of PEEK and our silicon nitride’s compressive strength is over twenty times that of PEEK. Unlike PEEK interbody spinal fusion devices, we believe our silicon nitride interbody spinal fusion devices can withstand the forces exerted during implantation and daily activities over the long term. 
● | Resistant to Wear. We believe our silicon nitride joint implant product candidates could have higher resistance to wear than metal-on-cross-linked polyethylene and traditional oxide ceramic-on-cross-linked polyethylene joint implants, the two most commonly used total hip replacement implants. Wear debris associated with metal implants increases the risk of metal sensitivity and metallosis. It is a primary reason for early failures of metal and polymer articulating joint components. 
● | Non-Corrosive. Our silicon nitride does not have the drawbacks associated with the corrosive nature of metal within the body, including metal sensitivity and metallosis, nor does it result in the release of metal ions into the body. As a result, we believe our silicon nitride products will have lower revision rates and fewer complications than comparable metal and traditional oxide ceramic products.

Supporting Data
 
We and a number of independent third parties have conducted extensive biocompatibility, biomechanical, in vivo and in vitro testing on our silicon nitride composition to establish its safety and efficacy in support of regulatory clearance of our biomaterial, products and product candidates. We have also completed additional testing of our silicon nitride products and product candidates. The results of this testing have been published in over 75 peer reviewed publications that include basic science studies, small- and large-animal data, and human clinical studies. We believe that our product development strategy is consistent with the manner in which other biomaterials have been successfully introduced into the market and adopted as the standard of care. Listed below is an overview of some of the key testing completed on our silicon nitride biomaterial, products and product candidates to date, as well as other information about our silicon nitride and other biomaterials.
Biocompatibility
 
Before our silicon nitride was cleared by the FDA in 2008, we conducted a series of biocompatibility tests following the guidelines of the FDA and ISO and submitted the results to the FDA as part of the regulatory clearance process. These tests confirmed that our silicon nitride products meet required biocompatibility standards for human use.
Promotion of Bone Growth
 
In 2012, we conducted two separate studies at Brown University, the results of which suggest that the chemistry and inherent surface topography of our solid silicon nitride provides an optimal environment for bone growth onto and around the device.
 
The first study was a series of in vitro analyses of protein adsorption, or presence on the surface of the biomaterial, onto silicon nitride, PEEK and titanium. The results of this study indicated that adsorption of two key proteins necessary for bone growth (fibronectin and vitronectin) were up to eight times greater on our silicon nitride than on PEEK, and up to four times greater than on titanium. A third important protein (laminin) had up to two times greater adsorption on our silicon nitride than on PEEK, and up to two-and-one-half times greater adsorption than on titanium.
 
The second study was an in vivo investigation of the osteointegration characteristics of these same three biomaterials after they had been surgically implanted into the skulls of laboratory rats. This study included an examination of the effect of Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteria on osteointegration. At time intervals of up to three months after implantation of the biomaterial, the amount of new bone growth within the surgical site and in direct contact with the implanted biomaterial was evaluated. In the absence of bacteria, new bone formation within the surgical site surrounding our silicon nitride was approximately 69%, compared with 36% and 24% for titanium and PEEK, respectively. Similarly, bone in direct contact, or apposition, with our silicon nitride, titanium and PEEK was 59%, 19% and 8%, respectively. As is common, in the presence of bacteria, new bone formation within the surgical site was suppressed, but still significantly greater for our silicon nitride than for the other two biomaterials. Observed new bone growth within the surgical site surrounding our silicon nitride was 41%, compared with 26% and 21% for titanium and PEEK, respectively. At the implant interface, the bone apposition for our silicon nitride, titanium and PEEK was 23%, 9% and 5%, respectively. To further characterize the extent of osteointegration, the force needed to separate each implant from its surrounding bone was measured. A larger force needed to separate the implant is an indication of improved osteointegration. At three months after implantation, in the absence of bacteria, the force required to separate our silicon nitride from its surrounding bone was approximately three times that of PEEK, and nearly two times that of titanium. In the presence of bacteria, there was effectively no separation force required for PEEK, indicating essentially no osteointegration. Our silicon nitride required over five times the force to separate it from its surrounding bone in the presence of bacteria in comparison to titanium.

In 2008, we conducted an animal study in which we evaluated the level of osteointegration of our porous silicon nitride with a knee-defect model in adult sheep. At three months after implantation, three out of five of the silicon nitride implants had extensive new bone formation at and into the implant surface, showing that the bone had grown into our porous silicon nitride to a depth of 3 millimeters, or mm. This animal study demonstrated the rapid osteointegration potential of our porous silicon nitride composition.
 
Hardness, Strength and Resistance to Fracture
 
Comparative Information
 
As shown in the table of comparative information publicly available about various biomaterials below:
 

● | the hardness, or a material’s resistance to deformity, of silicon nitride is comparable to traditional ceramics, but is substantially higher than either polymers or metals; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the strength of silicon nitride is comparable or higher than metals and traditional ceramics, and is about sixteen to fifty-five times stronger than highly-cross-linked polyethylene, and four to eight times stronger than PEEK; and 
● | silicon nitride has the highest fracture resistance of any medical ceramic material and is three to eleven times more resistant to fracture than PEEK or highly-cross-linked polyethylene. This is due to the interwoven microstructure of silicon nitride. Metals have the highest fracture resistance. 

Comparison of Mechanical Properties Among Orthopedic Biomaterials
 

Material | Hardness (GPa)(1) | | Strength (MPa)(1) | | Fracture Resistance (MPam1/2)(1) 
---------------------------------------------+-------------------+------------------------------------------------------+-------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------
Silicon Nitride | | 13 – 16 | | 800 – 1200 | | 8 – 11 
Aluminum Oxide Ceramic | | 14 – 19 | | 300 – 500 | | 3 – 5 
Zirconia-Toughened Alumina Ceramic | | 12 – 19 | | 700 – 1150 | | 5 – 10 
PEEK | | 0.09 – 0.28 | | 160 – 180 | | 2 – 3 
Highly-Cross-Linked Polyethylene Polymer | | 0.03 – 0.07 | | 22 – 48 | | 1 – 2 
Cobalt-Chromium Metal | | 3 – 4 | | 700 – 1000 | | 50 – 100 
Titanium Alloy Metal | | 3 – 4 | | 920 – 980 | | 75

----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe that the combination of high hardness, strength and fracture resistance positions our silicon nitride as an ideal biomaterial for many medical applications.
 
Burst Strength
 
In 2006, we conducted in-house comparative “burst strength” tests on femoral heads made from our silicon nitride produced by a contract manufacturer to our specifications and femoral heads made from one of the strongest commercially available ceramics, BIOLOX® delta (zirconia-toughened alumina). These tests were performed on three designs of 28 mm femoral heads using accepted testing protocols. The tests involved applying a load to each femoral head while mounted on a cobalt-chromium simulated hip implant stem, until the head burst. This enabled us to directly compare the strength of the femoral heads made of the two biomaterials. The results also provided an indication of each biomaterial’s resistance to fracture. The results of these tests are shown in the chart below.

-



The average burst test strength for the silicon nitride femoral heads in these tests was 75 kilonewtons, or kNs, compared with 65 kN for BIOLOX® delta, or about a 15% improvement. The burst strengths observed in our tests for BIOLOX® delta femoral heads are comparable to those observed by an independent party testing the same design BIOLOX® delta femoral heads as we did. We also conducted burst strength tests of 36 mm femoral heads made from our silicon nitride which showed those femoral heads had burst strengths that averaged 164 kN.
 
Resistance to Wear
 
In 2011, we commissioned an independent laboratory to conduct a wear study using our silicon nitride femoral heads. We tested our 28 mm silicon nitride femoral heads articulated against cross-linked polyethylene acetabular liners and our 40 mm silicon nitride femoral heads articulated against cross-linked polyethylene acetabular liners using well-established protocols in a hip simulator for their wear performance over 5 million cycles. We then compared the results for our silicon nitride product candidates to the results for the cobalt chrome femoral head and publicly available data from other commonly paired products. The results and comparison showed that:

● | our silicon nitride-on-cross-linked polyethylene had approximately half the wear rate of that publicly reported for cobalt chrome-on-cross-linked polyethylene articulating hip components; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | our silicon nitride-on-cross-linked polyethylene had comparable wear to that publicly reported for traditional oxide ceramic-on-cross-linked polyethylene articulating hip components. 

Antibacterial Properties
 
The results of the two studies at Brown University in 2012, demonstrate that our solid silicon nitride has antibacterial properties. The objective of the in vitro study was to determine how our silicon nitride, PEEK and titanium interact with bacteria, protein and bone cells without the use of antibiotics and compared the growth of five different types of bacteria on silicon nitride, PEEK and titanium over time. Live bacteria counts were between 8 to 30 times lower on silicon nitride than PEEK and up to 8 times lower on silicon nitride than titanium.
 
In the in vivo study, bacteria were applied to the biomaterials before implantation. Three months after implantation, no infection was observed with silicon nitride, whereas both PEEK and titanium showed infection. The data demonstrate that our silicon nitride inhibits biofilm formation and bacterial colonization around the biomaterial.
 
Antiviral and Antifungal Properties
 
Antiviral: Our data have shown that off-stoichiometric reactions at the surface of our silicon nitride can inactivate different types of single-strand RNA viruses. This antiviral property derives from reactive nitrogen species without harm to mammalian cells. Testing based on polymerase chain reaction tests of viral RNA and in situ Raman spectroscopy suggest that our material is effective in counteracting several viruses relevant to public health concerns, such as Influenza A, Feline calcivirus, and Enterovirus.

Antfungal: We have conducted preliminary studies which suggest that our silicon nitride may be effective against fungal microbes. After sintering and processing, powdered silicon nitride was dissolved in a 1.5 vol.% aqueous solution that underwent field testing on two species of grape vine leaves that were infected with a fungal pathogen Plasmopara viticola. After 1 minute of exposure to our silicon nitride, the infected area of the leaves was reduced by ~95%. The likely mechanism likely involves electrical attraction to, and attachment of silicon nitride particles to oppositely-charged pathogen spores.
 
Imaging Compatibility
 
In 2007, we conducted a study to compare the imaging characteristics of test blanks made of PEEK, the metals titanium and tantalum, and silicon nitride using a cadaver human vertebral body. Images of the vertebral body and the blanks were obtained using X-ray, CT and MRI under identical conditions. We assessed the radiolucent characteristics of the blanks in X-ray images quantitatively, assessed the presence of scatter in CT qualitatively and assessed distortion in MRI quantitatively. In X-ray, the metal blanks did not permit visualization of the underlying bone of the vertebral body, while PEEK was transparent, rendering its location difficult to determine. The silicon nitride blank had an intermediate radiolucency that rendered it visible and allowed a visual assessment of the underlying bone of the vertebral body. CT and MRI of the metal blanks indicated the presence of distortion while silicon nitride and PEEK exhibited no scattering.
Our Forms of Silicon Nitride
 
To control the quality, cost and availability of our silicon nitride products and product candidates, we operate our own manufacturing facility. Our 54,000 square foot corporate building includes a 30,000 square foot FDA Registered and ISO 13485 certified medical device manufacturing space. It is equipped with state-of-the-art powder processing, spray drying, pressing and computerized machining equipment, sintering furnaces, and other testing equipment that enables us to control the entire manufacturing process for our silicon nitride products and product candidates. To our knowledge, we are the only vertically integrated silicon nitride orthopedic medical device manufacturer in the world. All operations with the exceptions of raw material production, cleaning, packaging and sterilization are performed in-house. We purchase raw materials, consisting of silicon nitride ceramic powder and dopant chemical compounds, from several vendors which are ISO registered and approved by us. These raw materials are characterized and tested in accordance with our specifications and then blended to formulate our silicon nitride. We believe that there are multiple vendors that can supply us these raw materials and we continually monitor the quality and pricing offered by our vendors to ensure high quality and cost-effective supply of these materials.
 
The chemical composition of our in-house formulation of silicon nitride and our processing and manufacturing experience allow us to produce silicon nitride in four distinct forms. This capability provides us with the ability to utilize our silicon nitride biomaterial in a variety of ways depending on the intended application, which, together with our silicon nitride’s key characteristics, distinguishes us from manufacturers of products using other biomaterials.
 
We currently produce silicon nitride for use in our commercial products and product candidates in the following forms:
 

● | Solid Silicon Nitride. This form of silicon nitride is a fully dense, load-bearing solid used for devices that require high strength, toughness, fracture resistance and low wear, including interbody spinal fusion devices, hip and knee replacement implants, and dental implants. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


10
--


● | Porous Silicon Nitride. While this form of silicon nitride has a chemical composition that is identical to that of our monolithic solid silicon nitride, this formulation has a porous structure, which is engineered to mimic cancellous bone, the spongy bone tissue that typically makes up the interior of human bones. Our porous silicon nitride has interconnected pores ranging in size between about 90 and 600 microns, which is similar to that of cancellous bone. This form of silicon nitride can be used for the promotion of bone in-growth and attachment. We believe our porous silicon nitride can act as a substitute for the orthobiologics currently used to fill interbody devices in an effort to stimulate fusion, as a bone void filler, and as a porous scaffold for medical devices. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Composite of Solid and Porous Silicon Nitride. This form of silicon nitride is a combination, or composite, of our solid monolithic and porous formulations of silicon nitride. This composite may be used to manufacture devices and implants that mimic the structure of natural bone by incorporating both a fully dense, load-bearing solid component on the outside and a porous component intended to promote bone in-growth on the inside. This composite form of silicon nitride is used in interbody spinal fusion devices and can be used in components for total hip and knee replacement implants. 
● | Composite of Silicon Nitride and PEEK. We have demonstrated in the laboratory that it is possible to compound our silicon nitride powder and the polymer PEEK and that the ensuing composite material maintains the bioactive properties of silicon nitride. We have engaged commercial partners to assist us in developing this technology. This composite material would allow the straightforward machinability of a complex device that would be more challenging to manufacture from silicon nitride alone. 
● | Silicon Nitride Coating. With a similar chemical composition as our other forms of silicon nitride, this form of silicon nitride can be applied as an adherent coating to metallic substrates, including cobalt-chromium, titanium and steel alloys, polymers, and ceramics. We believe applying an extremely thin layer of silicon nitride as a coating may provide a highly wear-resistant articulation surface, such as on femoral heads, which may reduce problems associated with metal or polymer wear debris. We also believe that the silicon nitride coating can be applied to devices that require firm fixation and functional connections between the device or implant and the surrounding tissue, such as hip stems and screws. The use of silicon nitride coating may also create an antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal barrier between the device and the adjacent bone or tissue. We are currently evaluating several different coating technologies.

Our Competitive Strengths
 
We believe we can use our silicon nitride technology platform to become a leading biomaterial company and have the following principal competitive strengths:
 

● | Sole Provider of Silicon Nitride Medical Devices. We believe we are the only company that designs, develops, manufactures and sells medical grade silicon nitride-based products. Due to its key characteristics, we believe our silicon nitride enables us to offer new and transformative products across multiple medical specialties. In addition, with the FDA clearance of our silicon nitride Valeo products, we are the only company to develop and manufacture a ceramic for use in FDA cleared spinal fusion medical devices in the United States. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | In-House Manufacturing Capabilities for Implantable Medical Devices. We operate a 30,000 square foot manufacturing facility located at our corporate headquarters in Salt Lake City, Utah. This operation complies with the FDA’s quality system regulation, or QSR, and is certified under the International Organization for Standardization’s, or ISO, standard 13485 for medical devices. This facility allows us to rapidly design and produce silicon nitride products while controlling the entire manufacturing process from raw material to finished goods. 
● | Extensive Network of Scientific Collaborators. We have developed strong, multi-year, collaborative relationships with surgeons who have used our products. These surgeons have supported us in collecting clinical data on silicon nitride and on reporting the successful patient outcomes they have observed. We also have long standing relations with university laboratories in Japan and the US and have recently been invited to participate in a European consortium on silicon nitride. Our partner in Japan has been at the forefront of silicon nitride biomaterial research for several years and has published extensively on the subject. 
● | Highly Experienced Management and Technical Advisory Team. Members of our management team have extensive experience in silicon nitride, ceramics, research and development, manufacturing and operations, product development, launching of new products into the orthopedics market and selling to hospitals through direct sales organizations, distributors, manufacturers and other orthopedic companies. We also collaborate with a network of leading technical (academic and surgeon) advisors in the design, development and use of our silicon nitride products and product candidates. 

Our Strategy
 
Our goal is to become a leading biomaterial company focused on using our silicon nitride technology platform to develop, manufacture and commercialize a broad range of medical devices. Key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are the following:

● | Support CTL and drive further adoption of silicon nitride interbody spinal fusion devices. We have entered into a 10-year agreement to manufacture all of CTL Medical’s requirements of silicon nitride based spinal implant products. This includes the current product line as well as new applications for silicon nitride in the spine. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Develop a commercial opportunity outside of spine. We have had active programs outside of spine for several years. We expect to commercialize on one or more of these in the near future. 
● | Develop new silicon nitride manufacturing technologies. Our current manufacturing process has allowed us to successfully produce spinal implants for over 10 years. However, this process has limitations and we are actively pursuing other manufacturing technologies such as additive manufacturing, and surface coating technologies. 
● | Make improvements to our current formulation of silicon nitride to increase the bioactive properties of the material. We have demonstrated in the laboratory that we can make our material more bioactive. This work has been independently corroborated by researchers in other parts of the world. We expect that the availability of silicon nitride with enhanced bioactivity would open up new markets to us.

● | Apply our silicon nitride technology platform to other OEM opportunities – medical and non-medical We believe our biomaterial expertise, flexible manufacturing process, and strong intellectual property will allow us to transition currently available medical device products made of inferior biomaterials and manufacture them using silicon nitride and our technology platform to improve their characteristics. We are seeking partnerships to utilize our capabilities and manufacture products for medical and non-medical original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) and private label partnerships. We see specific opportunities in markets such as dental, maxillofacial, total hip and knee joint replacements, and sports medicine.

Market Opportunity
 
Overview
 
We believe our silicon nitride biomaterial technology platform provides us with numerous competitive advantages in the biomaterials market. We manufactured interbody spinal fusion devices for our own retail spine business from 2008 to 2018, presently manufacture these for CTL Medical, and have a 10-year exclusive right to continue to manufacture them for CTL Medical. We are developing products on our own behalf and for third party manufacturers – including CTL Medical - for use as components in spine, total hip and knee joint replacements, as well as dental and maxillofacial applications. We believe we can also utilize our silicon nitride technology platform to develop future products in additional markets, such as the sports medicine, extremities, trauma, and non-medical markets.
 
We believe that the main drivers for growth within the orthopedic biomaterials market are the following:
 

● | Introduction of New Technologies. Better performing and longer-lasting biomaterials, improved diagnostics, and advances in surgical procedures allow for surgical intervention earlier in the continuum of care and better outcomes for patients. We believe surgical options using better performing and longer-lasting biomaterials will gain acceptance among surgeons and younger patients and drive accelerated growth and increase the size of the spinal fusion and joint replacement markets. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Favorable and Changing Demographics. With the growing number of elderly people, age-related ailments are expected to rise sharply, which we believe will increase the demand and need for biomaterials and devices with improved performance capabilities. Also, middle-aged and older patients increasingly expect to enjoy active lifestyles, and consequently demand effective treatments for painful spine and joint conditions, including better performing and longer-lasting interbody spinal fusion devices and joint replacements. 
● | Market Expansion into New Geographic Areas. We anticipate that demand for biomaterials and the associated medical devices will increase as the applications in which biomaterials are used are introduced to and become more widely accepted in underserved countries, such as Brazil and China. We also expect to introduce our products into established markets such as Australia and Japan. 

The Interbody Spinal Fusion Market
 
We believe there is opportunity for significant growth in the spinal fusion market for interbody spinal fusion devices manufactured with silicon nitride. Currently, in spinal fusion procedures conducted in the United States today, a significant majority utilize interbody devices comprised of PEEK and bone, with occasional use of metals and other materials including ceramics. The market for interbody spinal fusion devices has shifted over time as new biomaterials with superior characteristics have been incorporated into these devices and have launched into the market. We believe the market has reached another inflection point as surgeons and hospitals recognized the limitations of devices currently available. Similarly, we believe silicon nitride interbody spinal fusion products address the key limitations of other biomaterials currently used in interbody spinal fusion devices and demonstrate superior characteristics needed to improve clinical outcomes.
 
We selected this market as the first application for our silicon nitride technology because of the limitations of currently available products, its size, and the key characteristics silicon nitride possesses, which are critical for superior interbody spinal fusion outcomes.

● | Promotion of Bone Growth. The biomaterial should be both osteoconductive and create an osteoinductive environment to promote bone growth in and around the interbody device to further support fusion and stability. Osteoconduction occurs when material serves as a scaffold to support the growth of new bone in and around the material. Osteoinduction involves the stimulation of osteoprogenitor cells to develop, or differentiate, into osteoblasts, which are cells that are needed for bone growth. A material which stimulates bone growth and accelerates fusion rates is ideal in spinal fusion procedures. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Antibacterial. Spinal fusion devices can become colonized with bacteria, which may limit fusion to adjacent vertebrae or cause serious infection. Treating device-related infection is costly and generally requires repeat surgery, including surgery to replace the device, referred to as revision surgery, which may extend hospital stays, suffering and disability for patients. A biomaterial that has antibacterial properties can reduce the incidence of bacteria colonization in and around the interbody device that can lead to infection, revision surgery and associated increased costs. 
● | Imaging Compatibility. The biomaterial should be visible through, and not inhibit the effective use of, common surgical and diagnostic imaging techniques, such as X-ray, CT and MRI. These imaging techniques are used by surgeons during and after spinal fusion procedures to assist in the proper placement of interbody devices and to assess the quality of post-operative bone fusion. 
● | Strength and Resistance to Fracture. The biomaterial should be strong and resistant to fracture during implantation of the device and to successfully restore intervertebral disc space and spinal alignment during the fusion process. The biomaterial should have high flexural strength, which is the ability to resist breakage during bending, and high compressive strength, which is the ability to resist compression under pressure, to withstand the static and dynamic forces exerted on the spine during daily activities over the long term. 

Spinal Fusion Products
 
Current spinal fusion products that we manufacture for CTL Medical are:

The Dental Market
 
We believe there is opportunity for significant growth in the dental implant market for dental implant devices manufactured with silicon nitride and are pursuing this opportunity aggressively. We have entered into a joint development agreement with a dental implant design company and distributor of dental technologies for the development of a silicon nitride based dental implant system and devices.
 
When a tooth is removed, one common approach to restoration is to use a multi-part construct consisting of an titanium implant (or screw), a zirconia abutment, and a crown. Potential applications for silicon nitride in this procedure include the implant and the abutment.

Silicon nitride is appealing because this application takes advantage of the same bioactive properties discussed in the spinal implant section:
 

● | Promotion of bone growth 
--+-------------------------------------------------
● | Antibacterial 
● | Imaging compatible 
● | Hard, strong, resistant to fracture and wear 

 
We also believe it may be possible to leverage our knowledge of medical device manufacturing of ceramics and commercialize products for the dental market made from ceramics other than silicon nitride.
 
The Hip and Knee Joint Replacement Market
 
We believe there is opportunity for significant growth in the hip and knee joint replacement market for interbody devices manufactured with silicon nitride.
 
Total joint replacement involves removing the diseased or damaged joint and replacing it with an artificial implant consisting of components made from several different types of biomaterials. The key components of a total hip implant include an artificial femoral head, consisting of a ball mounted on an artificial stem attached to the femur, and a liner, which is placed inside a cup affixed into the pelvic bone. The femoral head and liner move against each other to replicate natural motion in what is known as an articulating implant. Total knee replacement implants also use articulating components and are comprised of the following four main components: a femoral condyle, which is a specially shaped bearing that is affixed to the lower end of the femur; a tibial tray that is affixed to the upper-end of the tibia; a tibial insert that is rigidly fixed to the tibial tray and serves as the surface against which the femoral condyle articulates; and a patella, or knee cap, which also articulates against the femoral condyle.
 
Implants for total hip and knee replacements are primarily differentiated by the biomaterials used in the components that articulate against one another. The combinations of biomaterials most commonly used in hip and knee replacement implants in the United States are metal-on-cross-linked polyethylene and traditional oxide ceramic-on-cross-linked polyethylene. The use of hip replacement implants incorporating metal-on-metal and traditional oxide ceramic-on-traditional ceramic biomaterials experienced a steep decline in the United States over the last several years due to their significant limitations. We believe that the most commonly used biomaterials in joint replacement implants also have limitations, and do not possess all of the following key characteristics required for optimal total joint replacement implants:
 

● | Resistance to Wear. The biomaterials should have sufficient hardness and toughness, as well as extremely smooth surfaces, to effectively resist wear. Because the articulating implants move against each other, they are subject to friction, which frequently leads to abrasive wear and the release of small wear particles. This may cause an inflammatory response which results in osteolysis, or bone loss. Surgeons have identified osteolysis as a leading cause of joint implant failure, resulting in the need for costly revision surgery to replace the failed implant. One of the most commonly used combinations of biomaterials, metal-on-cross-linked polyethylene, as well as metal-on-metal implants, tends to generate a large number of metal wear particles, which can cause osteolysis and a moderate to severe allergic reaction to the metal, referred to as metal sensitivity. While less common, metal implants may also cause a serious medical condition called metallosis, which involves the deposition and build-up of metal debris in the soft tissues of the body. Both metal sensitivity and metallosis can result in revision surgery. In addition, we believe traditional oxide ceramics currently used in total joint replacements accelerate wear of the cross-linked polyethylene liner as compared to our non-oxide ceramic composition found in our silicon nitride biomaterial platform. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Non-Corrosive. The biomaterials should be non-corrosive and should not cause adverse patient reactions. Metal placed in the human body corrodes over time and also results in the formation of metal ions, which leads to metal sensitivity in approximately 10% to 15% of the population and, less commonly, metallosis. As a result, there are significant increased risks from using metal-on-cross-linked polyethylene and metal-on-metal implants. 
● | Hardness, Strength and Resistance to Fracture. The biomaterials should be hard, strong and resistant to fracture to adequately bear the significant loads placed on the hip and knee joints during daily activities. We believe there are strength limitations associated with traditional oxide ceramic-on-cross-linked polyethylene and traditional oxide ceramic-on-traditional oxide ceramic implants. 


● | Antibacterial. The biomaterials should have antibacterial properties to reduce the risk of bacteria colonization, infection, revision surgeries and associated increased costs. None of the most commonly used biomaterials in joint replacement implants have antibacterial properties.

Our Total Hip Implant Product Candidates
 
We have developed a femoral head that is made from our solid silicon nitride, which could be used for total hip replacement product candidates. This femoral head is expected to articulate against a cross-linked polyethylene liner fixed into a metal acetabular cup. Most recently we participated in a university study that demonstrated the comparatively better behavior of silicon nitride femoral heads in taper fretting corrosion behavior study. As we continue to gather evidence that silicon nitride femoral heads are superior in terms of wear performance, taper corrosion, strength and in vitro hydrothermal stability, we eventually intend to commercialize this product in cooperation with a strategic partner. However, clearance of these types of devices by the FDA will be required. Currently, the FDA has indicated that a limited one to two-year clinical trial may be necessary to obtain clearance.
Our Total Knee Implant Product Candidates
 
We have developed a femoral condyle design made from our solid silicon nitride. The femoral condyle component will attach to the lower end of the femur. The femoral condyle is expected to articulate against a cross-linked polyethylene tibial insert that will attach to the tibial tray at the upper end of the tibia, which we expect will be made from metal. We have successfully made prototypes of this design. Following the potential clearance of the femoral head components (discussed above), we intend to initiate biomechanical testing with a strategic partner for silicon nitride components for use in knee replacement procedures to support a 510(k) submission to the FDA. If this clearance is eventually obtained, we intend to commercialize our products for use in total knee replacement surgeries post-FDA clearance.
Other Product Opportunities
 
Our silicon nitride technology platform is adaptable, and we believe it may be used to develop products to address other significant opportunities, such as in the cranial-maxillofacial, extremities, sports medicine and trauma markets.
 
We also believe our coating technology may be used to enhance metal products as well as other commercially available metal or PEEK spinal fusion and joint replacement products. We have produced feasibility prototypes of dental implants, other components for use in total hip implants in addition to our total hip and knee implant product candidates discussed above, a suture anchor for sports medicine applications, an osteotomy wedge for extremities applications, and prototypes of silicon nitride-coated plates for potential trauma applications. We have also developed a process to apply our silicon nitride as a coating on other materials which may find applications in markets outside of the medical device industry.
 
Our recent discoveries of the antiviral and antifungal properties of silicon nitride have opened up completely new opportunities for us in the consumer and agriculture markets.
 
The FDA has not evaluated any of these potential products and we are not currently advancing the development of any of these product candidates. We plan to collaborate with medical device companies to complete the development of and commercialize any product candidates we advance in these areas or develop any one of them ourselves if sufficient resources should become available.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements, proprietary information ownership agreements and other intellectual property measures to protect our intellectual property rights. We believe that in order to have a competitive advantage, we must continue to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technologies.

As of the end of January 2019, we had thirteen issued U.S. patents, three pending U.S. patent applications, and one pending PCT application. Our first issued patent expired in 2016, with the last of these patents expiring in 2036. The core patent (US 6,881,229) expires in 2022.
 
We have seven U.S. patents directed to articulating implants using our high-strength, high toughness doped silicon nitride solid ceramic. The issued patents, which include US 6,881,229; US 7,666,229; US 7,780,738; US 8,123,812; US 8,133,284; US 9,051,639; and US 9,517,136 begin to expire in 2022.
 
We also have two U.S. patents related to our CSC technology that are directed to implants that have both a dense load-bearing, or cortical, component and a porous, or cancellous, component, together with a surface coating. These issued patents, US 8,133,284 and US 9,649,197, expire in 2022 and 2035, respectively.
 
We also have three U.S. patents that we acquired in July 2012 from Dytech Corporation Ltd., or Dytech, directed to manufacturing processes for the production of porous ceramics for use in our orthopedic implants. These patents include US 5,563,106 and US 5,705,448, which have now expired; and US 6,617,270, which expires in 2019. Under our acquisition agreement with Dytech, Dytech granted to us a perpetual, irrevocable and exclusive license, including the right to grant sublicenses, to certain improvements and know-how related to the acquired patents. In return, we are required to pay Dytech a low single-digit royalty on net sales of products sold by us, our affiliates, or our licensees that are covered by one or more valid claims of these patents, and a percentage of any non-royalty licensing income we may receive in the event we grant a license to others.
 
Our remaining issued patents and pending applications are directed to additional aspects of our products and technologies including, among other things:
 

● | designs for intervertebral fusion devices; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------
● | designs for hip implants; 
● | designs for knee implants; 
● | implants with improved antibacterial characteristics; 
● | implants with improved wear performance; and 
● | Antipathogenic compositions. 

 
We also expect to rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our intellectual property position. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We seek to protect the trade secrets in our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with commercial partners, collaborators, employees, consultants, scientific advisors and other contractors and into invention assignment agreements with our employees and some of our commercial partners and consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of the technologies that are developed.
 
Competition
 
The main alternatives to our silicon nitride biomaterial include: PEEK, which is predominantly manufactured by Invibio; BIOLOX® delta, which is a traditional oxide ceramic manufactured by CeramTec; allograft bone; metals; and coated metals.
 
We believe our main competitors in the orthopedic implant market, which utilize a variety of competitive biomaterials, include: Medtronic, Inc.; DePuy Synthes Companies, a group of Johnson & Johnson companies; Stryker Corporation; Biomet, Inc.; Zimmer Holdings, Inc.; Smith & Nephew plc; and Aesculap Inc. Presently, these companies buy ceramic components on an OEM basis from manufacturers such as CeramTec, Kyocera and CoorsTek, Inc., among others. We anticipate that these and other orthopedic companies and OEMs will seek to introduce new biomaterials and products that compete with ours.
 

17
--


Competition within the industry is primarily based on technology, innovation, product quality, and product awareness and acceptance by surgeons. Our principal competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources, as well as significantly greater manufacturing capabilities than we do, and they may succeed in developing products that render our implants and product candidates non-competitive. Our ability to compete successfully will depend upon our ability to develop innovative products with advanced performance features based on our silicon nitride technologies.
 
Government Regulation of Medical Devices
 
Governmental authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local levels, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are commercializing and developing. Failure to obtain approval or clearance to market our products and products under development and to meet the ongoing requirements of these regulatory authorities could prevent us from continuing to market or develop our products and product candidates.
United States
 
Pre-Marketing Regulation
 
In the United States, medical devices are regulated by the FDA. Unless an exemption applies, a new medical device will require either prior 510(k) clearance or approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA, before it can be marketed in the United States. The information that must be submitted to the FDA in order to obtain clearance or approval to market a new medical device varies depending on how the medical device is classified by the FDA. Medical devices are classified into one of three classes on the basis of the controls deemed by the FDA to be necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness. Class I devices, which are those that have the lowest level or risk associated with them, are subject to general controls, including labeling, premarket notification and adherence to the QSR. Class II devices are subject to general controls and special controls, including performance standards. Class III devices, which have the highest level of risk associated with them, are subject to most of the previously identified requirements as well as to premarket approval. Most Class I devices and some Class II devices are exempt from the 510(k) requirements, although manufacturers of these devices are still subject to registration, listing, labeling and QSR requirements.
 
A 510(k) premarket notification must demonstrate that the device in question is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed device, or predicate device, that did not require premarket approval. In evaluating the 510(k), the FDA will determine whether the device has the same intended use as the predicate device, and (a) has the same technological characteristics as the predicate device, or (b) has different technological characteristics, and (i) the data supporting the substantial equivalence contains information, including appropriate clinical or scientific data, if deemed necessary by the FDA, that demonstrates that the device is as safe and as effective as a legally marketed device, and (ii) does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than the predicate device. Most 510(k)s do not require clinical data for clearance, but the FDA may request such data. The FDA’s goal is to review and act on each 510(k) within 90 days of submission, but it may take longer based on requests for additional information. In addition, requests for additional data, including clinical data, will increase the time necessary to review the notice. If the FDA does not agree that the new device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device, the new device will be classified in Class III, and the manufacturer must submit a PMA. Since July 2012, however, with the enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, a de novo pathway is directly available for certain low to moderate risk devices that do not qualify for the 510(k) pathway due to lack of a predicate device. Modifications to a 510(k)-cleared medical device may require the submission of another 510(k) or a PMA if the changes could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness or constitute a major change in the intended use of the device.
 
Modifications to a 510(k)-cleared device frequently require the submission of a traditional 510(k), but modifications meeting certain conditions may be candidates for FDA review under a Special 510(k). If a device modification requires the submission of a 510(k), but the modification does not affect the intended use of the device or alter the fundamental scientific technology of the device, then summary information that results from the design control process associated with the cleared device can serve as the basis for clearing the application. A Special 510(k) allows a manufacturer to declare conformance to design controls without providing new data. When the modification involves a change in material, the nature of the “new” material will determine whether a traditional or Special 510(k) is necessary. For example, in its Device Advice on How to Prepare a Special 510(k), the FDA uses the example of a change in a material in a finger joint prosthesis from a known metal alloy to a ceramic that has not been used in a legally marketed predicate device as a type of change that should not be submitted as a Special 510(k). However, if the “new” material is a type that has been used in other legally marketed devices within the same classification for the same intended use, a Special 510(k) is appropriate. The FDA gives as an example a manufacturer of a hip implant who changes from one alloy to another that has been used in another legally marketed predicate. Special 510(k)s are typically processed within 30 days of receipt.
 

18
--


The PMA process is more complex, costly and time consuming than the 510(k) clearance procedure. A PMA must be supported by extensive data including, but not limited to, technical, preclinical, clinical, manufacturing, control and labeling information to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. After a PMA is submitted, the FDA has 45 days to determine whether it is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If the PMA is complete, the FDA will file the PMA. The FDA is subject to performance goal review times for PMAs and may issue a decision letter as a first action on a PMA within 180 days of filing, but if it has questions, it will likely issue a first major deficiency letter within 150 days of filing. It may also refer the PMA to an FDA advisory panel for additional review and will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the QSR, either of which could extend the 180-day response target. While the FDA’s ability to meet its performance goals has generally improved during the past few years, it may not meet these goals in the future. A PMA can take several years to complete and there is no assurance that any submitted PMA will ever be approved. Even when approved, the FDA may limit the indication for which the medical device may be marketed or to whom it may be sold. In addition, the FDA may request additional information or request the performance of additional clinical trials before it will reconsider the approval of the PMA or as a condition of approval, in which case the trials must be completed after the PMA is approved. Changes to the device, including changes to its manufacturing process, may require the approval of a supplemental PMA.
 
If a medical device is determined to present a “significant risk,” the manufacturer may not begin a clinical trial until it submits an investigational device exemption, or IDE, to the FDA and obtains approval of the IDE from the FDA. The IDE must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results and include a proposed clinical protocol. These clinical trials are also subject to the review, approval and oversight of an institutional review board, or IRB, which is an independent and multi-disciplinary committee of volunteers who review and approve research proposals, and the reporting of adverse events and experiences, at each institution at which the clinical trial will be performed. The clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with applicable regulations, including but not limited to the FDA’s IDE regulations and current good clinical practices. A clinical trial may be suspended by the FDA, the IRB or the sponsor at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to the study participants outweigh the benefits of participation in the trial. Even if a clinical trial is completed, the results may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a device or may be equivocal or otherwise not be sufficient to obtain approval.
 
Post-Marketing Regulation
 
After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include:
 

● | compliance with the QSR, which require manufacturers to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation, record maintenance, including maintenance of complaint and related investigation files, and other quality assurance controls during the manufacturing process; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | labeling regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; and 
● | medical device reporting obligations, which require that manufacturers investigate and report to the FDA adverse events, including deaths, or serious injuries that may have been or were caused by a medical device and malfunctions in the device that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. 


19
--


Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions:
 

● | warning letters; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; 
● | recall or seizure of our products; 
● | operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 
● | refusal to grant 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals of new products; 
● | withdrawal of 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals; and 
● | criminal prosecution. 

 
To ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, medical device manufacturers are subject to market surveillance and periodic, pre-scheduled and unannounced inspections by the FDA, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors.
 
International Regulation
 
International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval, and the requirements may differ. For example, the primary regulatory authority with respect to medical devices in Europe is that of the European Union. The European Union consists of 28 countries and has a total population of over 500 million people. The unification of these countries into a common market has resulted in the unification of laws, standards and procedures across these countries, which may expedite the introduction of medical devices like those we are offering and developing. Norway, Iceland, Lichtenstein and Switzerland are not members of the European Union but have transposed applicable European medical device laws into their national legislation. Thus, a device that is marketed in the European Union may also be recognized and accepted in those four non-member European countries as well.
 
The European Union has adopted numerous directives and standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices. Devices that comply with the requirements of relevant directives will be entitled to bear CE Conformity Marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout the European Union. Actual implementation of these directives, however, may vary on a country-by-country basis. The CE Mark is a mandatory conformity mark on medical devices distributed and sold in the European Union and certifies that a medical device has met applicable requirements.
 
The method of assessing conformity varies, but normally involves a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer and a third-party assessment by a “Notified Body.” Notified Bodies are independent testing houses, laboratories, or product certifiers authorized by the European Union member states to perform the required conformity assessment tasks, such as quality system audits and device compliance testing. An assessment by a Notified Body based within the European Union is required in order for a manufacturer to distribute the product commercially throughout the European Union. Medium and higher risk devices require the intervention of a Notified Body which will be responsible for auditing the manufacturer’s quality system. The Notified Body will also determine whether or not the product conforms to the requirements of the applicable directives. Devices that meet the applicable requirements of E.U. law and have undergone the appropriate conformity assessment routes will be granted CE “certification.” The CE Mark is mandatory for medical devices sold not only within the countries of the European Union but more generally within most of Europe. As many of the European standards are converging with international standards, the CE Mark is often used on medical devices manufactured and sold outside of Europe (notably in Asia that exports many manufactured products to Europe). CE Marking gives companies easier access into not only the European market but also to Asian and Latin American markets, most of whom recognize the CE Mark on medical device as a mark of quality and adhering to international standards of consumer safety, health or environmental requirements.

Compliance with Healthcare Laws
 
We must comply with various U.S. federal and state laws, rules and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims laws, rules, and regulations, as well as other healthcare laws in connection with the commercialization of our products. Fraud and abuse laws are interpreted broadly and enforced aggressively by various state and federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services and various state agencies.
 
We have entered into agreements with certain surgeons for assistance with the design of our products, some of whom we anticipate may make referrals to us or order our products. A majority of these agreements contain provisions for the payments of royalties. In addition, some surgeons currently own shares of our stock. We have structured these transactions with the intention of complying with all applicable laws, including fraud and abuse, data privacy and security, and transparency laws. Despite this intention, there can be no assurance that a particular government agency or court would determine our practices to be in full compliance with such laws. We could be materially impacted if regulatory or enforcement agencies or courts interpret our financial arrangements with surgeons to be in violation of healthcare laws, including, without limitation, fraud and abuse, data privacy and security, or transparency laws.
 
The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons, including a medical device manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), from knowingly or willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for a service or product or the purchasing, ordering, arranging for, or recommending the ordering of, any service or product for which payment may be made by Medicare, Medicaid or any other federal healthcare program. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between medical device manufacturers on one hand and healthcare providers on the other. The term “remuneration” is not defined in the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, such as cash payments, gifts or gift certificates, discounts, waiver of payments, credit arrangements, ownership interests, the furnishing of services, supplies or equipment, and the provision of anything at less than its fair market value. Courts have broadly interpreted the scope of the law, holding that it may be violated if merely “one purpose” of an arrangement is to induce referrals, irrespective of the existence of other legitimate purposes. The Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain business arrangements from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from federal Anti-Kickback Statute liability. The reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute was broadened by the recently enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively, the Affordable Care Act or ACA, which, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (discussed below) or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes fines against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. In addition to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, many states have their own anti-kickback laws. Often, these laws closely follow the language of the federal law, although they do not always have the same scope, exceptions, safe harbors or sanctions. In some states, these anti-kickback laws apply not only to payments made by government healthcare programs but also to payments made by other third-party payors, including commercial insurance companies.
 
Sales, marketing, consulting, and advisory arrangements between medical device manufacturers and sales agents and physicians are subject to the Anti-Kickback Statute and other fraud and abuse laws. Government officials have focused recent enforcement efforts on, among other things, the sales and marketing activities of healthcare companies, including medical device manufacturers, and have brought cases against individuals or entities whose personnel allegedly offered unlawful inducements to potential or existing customers in an attempt to procure their business. We expect these activities to continue to be a focus of government enforcement efforts. Settlements of these cases by healthcare companies have involved significant fines and penalties and, in some instances, criminal plea agreements. We are also aware of governmental investigations of some of the largest orthopedic device companies reportedly focusing on consulting and service agreements between these companies and orthopedic surgeons. These developments are ongoing, and we cannot predict the effects they will have on our business.

The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim, or has caused such a claim to be submitted, to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act. Liability arises, primarily, when a person knowingly submits, or causes another to submit, a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The False Claims Act has been used to assert liability on the basis of inadequate care, kickbacks, and other improper referrals, and allegations as to misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered. Qui tam actions have increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of healthcare companies, including medical device manufacturers, to defend false claim actions, pay damages and penalties, or be excluded from participation in Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs as a result of investigations arising out of such actions. In addition, various states have enacted similar laws analogous to the False Claims Act. Many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payor and not merely a federal healthcare program. We are unable to predict whether we would be subject to actions under the False Claims Act or a similar state law, or the impact of such actions. However, the cost of defending such claims, as well as any sanctions imposed, could adversely affect our financial performance. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, also created several new federal crimes, including healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services.
 
In addition, we may be subject to, or our marketing or research activities may be limited by, data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. For example, HIPAA and its implementing regulations established uniform federal standards for certain “covered entities” (healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, commonly referred to as the economic stimulus package, included expansion of HIPAA’s privacy and security standards called the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, which became effective on February 17, 2010. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates”—independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain, or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. These laws also require the reporting of breaches of protected health information to affected individuals, regulators and in some cases, local or national media. HIPAA and HITECH impose strict limits on our physician collaborators’ ability to use and disclose patient information on our behalf.
 
There are also an increasing number of state “sunshine” laws that require manufacturers to provide reports to state governments on pricing and marketing information. Several states have enacted legislation requiring medical device companies to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales and marketing activities, and to prohibit or limit certain other sales and marketing practices. In addition, a federal law known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, now requires medical device manufacturers to track and report to the federal government certain payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals and ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The first reporting period covered only payments or transfers of value made and ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members from August 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013. The federal government disclosed the reported information on a publicly available website beginning in September 2014. For calendar year 2014, the Physician Payments Sunshine Act will require medical device manufacturers to report payments and transfers of values made and ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members for the full calendar year. These laws may adversely affect our sales, marketing, and other activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. If we fail to track and report as required by these laws or to otherwise comply with these laws, we could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities.

Clinical research is heavily regulated by FDA regulations for the protection of human subjects (21 C.F.R. 50 and 56) and also the regulations of the U.S Department of Health and Human Services, or the Common Rule (45 C.F.R 46). Both FDA human subject regulations and the Common Rule impose restrictions on the involvement of human subjects in clinical research and require, among other things, the balancing of the risks and benefits of research, the documented informed consent of research participants, initial and ongoing review of research by an IRB. Similar regulations govern research conducted in foreign countries. Compliance with human subject protection regulations is costly and time consuming. Failure to comply could substantially and adversely impact our research program and the development of our products.
 
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product clearances and approvals, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Public disclosure of privacy and data security violations could cause significant reputational harm. Any of these events could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, implementation of corporate compliance programs, as well as laws and regulations requiring transparency of pricing and marketing information and governing the privacy and security of health information, such as the E.U.’s Directive 95/46 on the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data, or the Data Directive, and the wide variety of national laws implementing the Data Directive.
 
Healthcare Reform
 
The regulations we are subject to may change as result of legislative and regulatory healthcare reform.
 
Significant healthcare reform was enacted in 2010 when the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or the PPACA, was signed into law. State laws also were enacted to implement the PPACA. While a primary goal of these healthcare reform efforts was to expand coverage to more individuals, it also involved increased government price controls, additional regulatory mandates and other measures designed to constrain medical costs. The PPACA significantly impacts the medical device industry. Among other things, the PPACA:

● | imposes an annual excise tax of 2.3% on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the United States, which began on January 1, 2013, but was suspended during 2016 and 2017 and has been suspended for 2018 and 2019; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | establishes a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee and identify priorities in comparative clinical effectiveness research in an effort to coordinate and develop such research; and 
● | implements payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models.

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. For example, on January 2, 2013, former President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or the ATRA, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Moreover, certain legislative changes to and regulatory changes under the PPACA have occurred in the 115th United States Congress and under the Trump Administration. For example, on December 22, 2017, President Trump signed a budget reconciliation act into law, which among other things, repealed the penalty for individuals who do not maintain minimum essential coverage, which was a central component of PPACA’s approach to expanding coverage. On January 9, 2018, President Trump signed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which, among other things, repealed the PPACA provision establishing an independent payment advisory board that would have submitted recommendations to reduce Medicare spending if projected Medicare spending exceeded a specified growth rate.
 
Additional legislative changes to and regulatory changes under the PPACA remain possible. We expect that other state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could reduce the number of patients with coverage or limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure.
 
Third-Party Reimbursement
 
Because we and our customers typically receive payment directly from hospitals and surgical centers, we do not anticipate relying directly on payment for any of our products from third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid, private insurers, and managed care companies. However, our business will be affected by policies administered by federal and state healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as private third-party payors, which often follow the policies of the state and federal healthcare programs. For example, our business will be indirectly impacted by the ability of a hospital or medical facility to obtain coverage and third-party reimbursement for procedures performed using our products. Many hospitals and clinics in the United States belong to group purchasing organizations (that typically incentivize their hospital members to make a relatively large proportion of purchases from a limited number of vendors of similar products that have contracted to offer discounted prices). Such contracts often include exceptions for purchasing certain innovative new technologies, however. Accordingly, the commercial success of our products may also depend to some extent on our ability to either negotiate favorable purchase contracts with key group purchasing organizations or persuade hospitals and clinics to purchase our product “off contract.” These third-party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not medically necessary; was not used in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods, as determined by the third-party payor; or was used for an unapproved use. A national or local coverage decision denying Medicare coverage for one or more of our products could result in private insurers and other third party payors also denying coverage. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for our products, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. The cost containment measures that third-party payors and providers are instituting, both within the United States and abroad, could significantly reduce our potential revenues from the sale of our products and any product candidates. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain and maintain third party coverage or adequate reimbursement for our products and product candidates in whole or in part.
 
For inpatient and outpatient procedures, including those that will involve use of our products, Medicare and many other third-party payors in the United States reimburse hospitals at a prospectively determined amount. This amount is generally based on one or more diagnosis related groups, or DRGs, associated with the patient’s condition for inpatient treatment and generally based on ambulatory payment classifications, or APCs, associated with the procedures performed as an outpatient at an ambulation surgicenter. Each DRG or APC is associated with a level of payment and may be adjusted from time to time, usually annually. Prospective payments are intended to cover most of the non-physician hospital costs incurred in connection with the applicable diagnosis and related procedures. Implant products, such as those we plan to sell, represent part of the total procedure costs while labor, hospital room and board, and other supplies and services represent the balance of those costs. However, the prospective payment amounts are typically set independently of a particular hospital’s actual costs associated with treating a particular patient and implanting a device. Therefore, the payment that a hospital would receive for a particular hospital visit would not typically take into account the cost of our products.

Medicare has established a number of DRGs for inpatient procedures that involve the use of products similar to ours. Although Medicare has authority to create special DRGs for hospital services that more properly reflect the actual costs of expensive or new-technology devices implanted as part of a procedure, it has declined to do so in the past, and we do not expect that it will do so with respect to our current products and product candidates. Medicare’s DRG and APC classifications may have implications outside of Medicare, as many other U.S. third-party payors often use Medicare DRGs and APCs for purposes of determining reimbursement.
 
We believe that orthopedic implants generally have been well received by third-party payors because of the ability of these implants to greatly reduce long-term healthcare costs for patients with degenerative joint disease. However, coverage and reimbursement policies vary from payor to payor and are subject to change. As discussed above, hospitals that purchase medical devices for treatment of their patients generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs and fees associated with the procedures performed with these devices. Both government and private third-party coverage and reimbursement levels are critical to new product acceptance. Neither hospitals nor surgeons are likely to use our products if they do not receive reimbursement for the procedures adequate to cover the cost of our products.
 
While it is expected that hospitals will be able to obtain coverage for procedures using our products, the level of payment available to them for such procedures may change over time. State and federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, closely regulate provider payment levels and have sought to contain, and sometimes reduce, payment levels. Commercial insurers and managed care plans frequently follow government payment policies and are likewise interested in controlling increases in the cost of medical care. These third-party payors may deny payment if they determine that a procedure was not medically necessary, a device used in a procedure was not used in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods, as determined by the third-party payor, or was used for an unapproved use.
 
In addition, some payors are adopting pay-for-performance programs that differentiate payments to healthcare providers based on the achievement of documented quality-of-care metrics, cost efficiencies, or patient outcomes. These programs are intended to provide incentives to providers to find ways to deliver the same or better results while consuming fewer resources. As a result of these programs, and related payor efforts to reduce payment levels, hospitals and other providers are seeking ways to reduce their costs, including the amounts they pay to medical device suppliers. Adverse changes in payment rates by payors to hospitals could adversely impact our ability to market and sell our products and negatively affect our financial performance.
 
In international markets, healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific product lines. There can be no assurance that our products will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that reimbursement will be available or, if available, that the third-party payors’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
 
Member countries of the European Union offer various combinations of centrally financed healthcare systems and private health insurance systems. The relative importance of government and private systems varies from country to country. Governments may influence the price of medical devices through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may be marketed only once a reimbursement price has been agreed upon. Some of these countries may require, as condition of obtaining reimbursement or pricing approval, the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Some E.U. member states allow companies to fix their own prices for devices but monitor and control company profits. The choice of devices is subject to constraints imposed by the availability of funds within the purchasing institution. Medical devices are most commonly sold to hospitals or healthcare facilities at a price set by negotiation between the buyer and the seller. A contract to purchase products may result from an individual initiative or as a result of a competitive bidding process. In either case, the purchaser pays the supplier, and payment terms vary widely throughout the European Union. Failure to obtain favorable negotiated prices with hospitals or healthcare facilities could adversely affect sales of our products.

Employees
 
As of February 28, 2019, we had 19 employees. We believe that our success will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. We have never experienced a work stoppage due to labor difficulties and believe that our relations with our employees are good. None of our employees are represented by labor unions.
