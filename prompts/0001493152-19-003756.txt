Item 1. Business
 
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report.
 
Overview
 
We have designed and developed, and now own and operate, a business-to-business, web-based marketplace focused on the pharmaceutical industry in the United States. Our core service is designed to bring the nation’s independent pharmacies and accredited national suppliers of pharmaceuticals together to provide efficient and transparent buying and selling opportunities on a web-based platform.
CORPORATE HISTORY
 
Background of XCEL
 
Our company was incorporated in Delaware on July 15, 2005 as “Bluebird Exploration Company” (“Bluebird”). Bluebird was originally formed to engage in the exploitation of mineral properties. In December 2008, Bluebird changed its name to “Xcellink International, Inc.” (“XCEL”), and subsequently announced that its business plan was being expanded to include the development and marketing of platform-independent customer-centric payment systems and methodologies. XCEL was unable to raise the funds necessary to implement its business strategy, never generated any revenue and was a reporting as a “shell” corporation. On January 9, 2014, Trxade Group, Inc., a privately held Nevada corporation, merged with and into XCEL, and XCEL changed its name to “Trxade Group, Inc.” XCEL’s shares traded on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board (“OTCBB”) market until early 2010.
Background of Trxade
 
PharmaCycle LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (“PharmaCycle”), was formed in August 2010 by Prashant Patel to serve as a web-based market platform designed to enable trading among healthcare buyers and sellers of pharmaceuticals, accessories and services. In January 2013, PharmaCycle converted into a Florida corporation and changed its name to Trxade, Inc. (“Trxade Florida”). In May 2013, Trxade Florida created a new wholly\-owned subsidiary, Trxade Group, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Trxade Nevada”). Trxade Nevada acquired Trxade Florida pursuant to a reverse triangular merger, resulting in Trxade Florida becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Trxade Nevada (the “Nevada-Florida Merger”). The sole purpose of the Nevada-Florida Merger was to provide for a holding company to own Trxade Florida, the operating company. At all times, up to the Nevada-Florida Merger, Trxade Florida was capitalized exclusively by cash capital contributions from Messrs. Suren Ajjarapu and Patel. Immediately following the Nevada-Florida Merger, Messrs. Ajjarapu and Patel collectively owned 99% of Trxade Nevada. After the Nevada-Florida Merger (but prior to the merger with XCEL), Trxade Nevada raised $670,000 through the sale of its preferred stock in private placements made to third party investors.

Reverse Merger with Trxade
 
On September 26, 2008, Mark Fingarson, the former President, sole Director and controlling shareholder of XCEL, sold 80,000,000 shares of XCEL to XCEL’s then attorney, Ron McIntyre. On November 22, 2013, Trxade Nevada acquired Mr. McIntyre’s controlling interest of 80,000,000 shares in XCEL pursuant to a Purchase and Sale Agreement dated November 7, 2013. At the time of the sale, XCEL had 104,160,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, including the 80,000,000 shares of stock acquired by Trxade Nevada.
 
On December 16, 2013, Trxade Nevada and XCEL entered into a definitive merger agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) providing for the merger (the “Merger”) of Trxade Nevada with and into XCEL, with XCEL as the surviving corporation. The Merger closed on January 8, 2014. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, we amended our articles of incorporation changed our name to “Trxade Group, Inc.,” and changed our trading symbol to XCEL.PK. On February 13, 2014, an additional 600,000 shares of our common stock (on a post-reverse split basis) were issued pursuant to the conversion of $19,333 in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding promissory notes.
 
Recapitalization of Common Stock by a Reverse Split and Increase of Authorized Shares of Stock
 
We also reversed our issued and outstanding stock at the ratio of one thousand-for-one (1,000:1) shares effective upon the closing of the Merger (the “Reverse Split”). In connection with the Reverse Split, 104,160,000 outstanding shares of our Common Stock, including the 80,000,000 shares held by Trxade Nevada, converted into 104,160 shares of Common Stock. As a result of the Merger, Trxade Nevada Shareholders holding 28,800,000 shares of Common Stock and 670,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock converted their shares on a one-to-one basis into 28,800,000 shares of our Common Stock and 670,000 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock, for an aggregate total of 29,470,000 shares. Further, 600,000 shares of our common stock (on a post- Reverse Split basis) were issued following the Merger in connection with the conversion of our promissory notes. The 80,000,000 pre-Merger shares held by Trxade Nevada, which amounted to 80,000 shares after the Reverse Split, reverted to treasury stock of the Company.
 
On June 11, 2015, pursuant to our Second Amended and Restated Certification of Incorporation, we decreased the authorized shares of our Common Stock from 500,000,000 to 100,000,000 and decreased the authorized shares of our Preferred Stock from 100,000,000 to 10,000,000. The Company is currently authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock with $0.00001 par value per share and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.00001 par value per share.
 
Subsidiaries
 
We own 100% of Trxade, Inc. This subsidiary is included in our attached consolidated financial statements and is engaged in the same line of business as Trxade. Trxade Florida is a web-based market platform that enables commerce among healthcare buyers and sellers of pharmaceuticals, accessories and services.
 
We own 100% of Integra Pharma Solutions, LLC, (formerly Pinnacle Tek, Inc., a Florida corporation) founded by Mr. Ajjarapu in 2011 (“INTEGRA”). Until the end of 2016, INTEGRA served as our technology consultant provider, but we discontinued that line of business in 2016. We now intend that INTEGRA serve as our logistics company for pharmaceutical distribution.
 
We own 100% of Community Specialty Pharmacy, LLC, an independent retail specialty pharmacy with a focus on specialty medications.
 
We own 100% of Alliance Pharma Solutions, LLC, a Florida limited liability company, which was founded in January 2018 (“Alliance”). Alliance currently owns 30% (with the option to acquire more) of SyncHealth MSO, LLC as part of a joint venture enabling independent retail pharmacies to better compete with large national pharmacies on pricing, distribution and logistics. Under our joint venture arraignment, we have the option to acquire 100% of SyncHealth MSO, LLC. For further information, please consult the Current Report on Form 8-K filed January 22, 2019 and referenced herein as Exhibits 10.2-10.7.
 
Sale of Westminster
 
We also owned 100 percent of Westminster Pharmaceuticals LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Westminster”), from 2015 through December 31, 2016. Trxade Florida formed Westminster in January 2013 as its wholly-owned subsidiary. This licensed subsidiary is included in our attached financial statements and provides state-licensed pharmacies and buying groups in the United States with pharmaceuticals approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). In late 2015 and early 2016, Westminster entered into multiple supply contracts with wholesale manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals to begin selling Westminster private label generic pharmaceuticals to our customers.
 
In December 2016, based on our management’s strategic review of our portfolio of businesses, we committed to a plan to sell our private label generic pharmaceutical businesses. On December 31, 2016, we entered into and consummated the sale of 100% of our equity interests in Westminster, and, in connection with the sale, we exited the private label generic pharmaceuticals business line. We sold Westminster in exchange for (a) the buyer’s cancellation of $1,500,000 of indebtedness owed by us under a senior secured note, (b) our issuance of warrants to the buyer to purchase 1,500,000 shares of our Common Stock (the “Warrants”), and (c) the buyer’s assumption of various contracts and obligations of Westminster. We issued the Warrants to the buyer at a strike price of $0.01 per share. The Warrants have an expiration date of five years from date of grant under the term and conditions of our warrant agreement with the buyer
 
The Westminster sale is considered a discontinued operation and, as a result, all consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been adjusted accordingly to reflect this financial statement presentation.

BUSINESS OF TRXADE
 
Our Principal Products and Services and their Markets.
 
Trxade.com is a web-based pharmaceutical marketplace engaged in promoting and enabling commerce among independent pharmacies and large pharmaceutical suppliers nationally. Our marketplace has hundreds of suppliers providing over 20,000 branded and generic drugs available for purchase by pharmacists. We already serve over 10,000 independent pharmacies. access to Trxade’s proprietary pharmaceutical database, data analytics regarding medication pricing, and manufacturer return policies. We generate revenue from these services by charging a transaction fee to the seller of the products for sales conducted via the Trxade platform. The buyers do not bear the cost of transaction fees for the purchases that they make, nor do they pay a fee to join or register with our platform. Substantially all of our revenues during the years ended December 31, 2018, and 2017, were from platform revenue generated on www.Trxade.com. For additional information, please visit us at http://www.trxadegroup.com, http://www.trxade.com, http://www.delivmeds.com, and https://www.trxademso.com.
 
Status of any publicly announced new products or services.
 
We have a number of products and services still in development, which are described below.
 
InventoryRx.com. InventoryRx, launched in the first quarter of 2014, is a web-based pharmaceutical exchange platform where wholesalers can buy and sell pharmaceuticals or over-the-counter medications with each other in a systematized online sales platform. The site offers these trading partners greater product availability and pricing transparency. The site may also substantially improve our customers buying efficiency and lower their cost of goods on a continuous basis. This product is built into the Trxade.com platform and, accordingly, we have not generated any independent revenue from this product.
 
Pharmabayonline. We formed Pharmabayonline to provide proprietary pharmaceutical data analytics and governmental reimbursement benchmarks analysis to United States-based independent pharmacies and pharmaceutical databases.
 
RxGuru. Our RxGuru application was launched in the first quarter of 2014 and underscores our commitment to deliver timely information to our customers at the moment before purchase. Our industry leading price prediction model “RxGuru” integrates product insight into pharmacy acquisition benchmarks (“PAC”) to ascertain trends and pricing variances which result in significant purchasing opportunities. “RX Guru” helps to predict prices and affords our members an opportunity continuously to benefit from real price purchasing opportunities that are often concealed from the rest of the industry. This product is built into the Trxade.com platform and, accordingly, this application works in conjunction with the Trxade platform but, to date, has not generated any independent revenue.
 
Integra Pharma Solutions, LLC. INTEGRA is intended to serve as our logistics company for pharmaceutical distribution and has limited operations and revenue at this time.
 
Community Specialty Pharmacy, LLC. We acquired Community Specialty Pharmacy, LLC, a Florida limited liability company (“CSP”), on October 15, 2018. CSP is an accredited pharmacy located in St. Petersburg, Florida. CSP has a focus on specialty medications. The company operates with an innovative pharmacy model which offers home delivery services to any patient thereby providing convenience. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information concerning the business combination and our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December 28, 2018.
 
Delivmeds.com. Delivmeds.com was launched in late 2018 as a consumer-based app to provide delivery of pharmaceutical products associated with Alliance Pharma Solutions, LLC. To date, we have not generated any revenue from this product.

Trxademso. Trxademso was launched early 2019 as part of the, SyncHealth MSO, LLC joint venture to assist independent retail pharmacies to compete better with large national pharmacies on pricing, distribution and logistics. To date, we have not generated any revenue from this product.
 
All our product offerings are focused on the United States markets. Some products are restricted just to certain states, depending upon the various applicable state regulations and guidelines pertaining to pharmaceuticals, particularly, and drug businesses, generally. Our services are distributed through our online platform.
 
Discontinued Operations.
 
Westminster Pharmaceuticals.
 
Westminster bought FDA-approved prescription medications from licensed pharmaceutical wholesalers and manufacturers from 2015 until 2016. Westminster stored these products at a licensed logistics location in Olive Brach, Mississippi until they were ready for delivery to Westminster’s customers once sold. In late 2015 and early 2016, Westminster entered into multiple supply contracts with wholesale manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals to begin selling Westminster private label generic pharmaceuticals to its customers. Westminster generated very limited revenue from the sale of its private label products. This business line was not profitable for the Company, and we sold Westminster in December 2016, thus concluding the Company’s exit from the private label generic pharmaceuticals business.
The Pharmaceutical Industry
 
According to the 2013-14 Economic Report on Retail, Mail, and Specialty Pharmacies by Adam J. Fein, Ph.D. (the “Fein Report”), United States pharmaceutical companies comprise a burgeoning $330 billion industry consisting of over 65,000 pharmacy facilities and 700 DEA-registered (and 1,500 State-licensed) suppliers. Management believes that few platforms currently in place to bring these participants together to share market knowledge, product pricing transparency and product availability. According to this, the pharmaceutical market is comprised primarily of three wholesalers that control an estimated approximately 92% of the market. Our management believes that this concentration has, over the years, led to a lack of price and cost transparency, thereby resulting in severe limitations on the purchasing choices of industry participants. These market dynamics have enabled these large wholesalers (McKesson, Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen), known as ADR distributors, to dominate the industry with respect to both generic and brand pharmaceuticals. The increasing concentration of generic medications (ANDA or Abbreviated New Drug Application), however, with many more expected to go to market in the near future (approximately $80 billion branded medications will lose their patent protection within the next ten years), have enabled smaller suppliers’ access to an increasing number of medications at highly discounted prices. The market is slowly changing towards one where medications will become a commoditized and influenced by price rather than the business relationships imposed by the dominant participants of the past.
 
To fuel this change, insurance companies (Pharmacy Benefits Management (“PBM”) and private health payers) and the federal government have recently initiated lower medication reimbursement payments to healthcare providers. We believe that pharmacies in due course will face increasing pressure to source medications as inexpensively as possible and improve operational efficiency. Trxade seeks to be in the forefront of solving these transparency and pricing concerns by providing independent, retail pharmacies with real-time, pharmacy acquisition cost (“PAC”) benchmarks to the National Drug Code (the “NDC”) standard. The NDC mark is a unique product identifier used in the United States for drugs intended for human use.
 
Competitive Business Conditions, Our competitive position in our Industry, and our Methods of Competition.
 
We expect to face competition from the three large ADR distributors (McKesson, Cardinal Health & AmerisourceBergen), other pharmaceutical distributors, buying groups, software products, and other start-up companies. Most of our competitors’ operations have substantially greater financial- and manufacturer-backed resources, longer operating histories, greater name recognition, and more established relationships in the industry.
 
Other Start-up Companies. 
 
We have identified start-ups that provide for supplier-pharmacy trading such as PharmaBid, RxCherrypick, PharmSaver, MatchRx and GenericBid, and provide web-based services similar to ours, allowing pharmacies to buy from several suppliers. Trxade differentiates itself from these exchanges by providing our pharmacies with both brand and generic pharmaceutical products. Additional companies target “direct-to-consumer” pharmacy deliveries, including Amazon.com’s PillPack, Capsule and GetRoman.com.
Buying Groups. 
 
Buying Groups provide discounted prices to their members by negotiating better pricing with one primary wholesaler, while charging administrative fees generally ranging from 3to 5percent. Some Buying Groups are structured like co-operatives (such as the IPC and API) and offer their members monthly or quarterly rebates. Although they can function well to bring pricing competition to the industry, they often offer rebates only after the purchase. Management does not believe Buying Groups will provide long-term savings to customers with this model given the increased transparency and competition in the industry.
Pharmaceutical Software.
 
Some pharmaceutical software companies compete with us to varying degrees at different levels. SureCost, for example, provides inventory management software enabling pharmacies to comply with primary supplier contracts. This software is fee-based and requires training.
 
Pharmacies may be reluctant to buy pharmaceuticals on the internet due to the historical negativity and uncertainty with respect to the origin and purity of drugs purchased off the web. Trxade management believes that as we continue to develop our brand, our customer base, and our vast product offerings, we will gain the trust of the market and overcome the negativity associated with purchasing via a pharmaceutical online marketplace.

One advantage that we believe we have over our competition is our ability to be flexible and fast moving in adjusting our business model to address the needs of our customer base. Trxade started by offering pharmacies a reverse auction model to enhance savings on the purchase of their pharmaceuticals. Customer feedback suggested that pharmacies prefer a more “buy now” format, which we implemented. This resulted in a “one-stop-one-search” platform to buy quality pharmaceuticals for less and a data-rich platform to help pharmacies overcome the complexities related to supply chain purchasing.
 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials; Principal Suppliers.
 
Trxade is a web-based technology platform. Because we are not a manufacturing company, we do not need any raw materials. Our module on the platform is drug supplier-to-retailer. We bring buyers and sellers together on this platform. Our suppliers include National Apothecary Solutions, Integral RX, and South Pointe Wholesale, Inc.
Dependence on One or More Major Customers.
 
As of the date of this Form 10-K, we have over 10,000 independent pharmacies and over 30 pharmaceutical suppliers as customers, with a market potential of approximately 24,000 independent pharmacies and 1,500 regional and local suppliers. We have a working relationship with over 25 wholesalers and the nation’s largest buying group. Although we believe those entities are satisfied with their business relationship with Trxade, if our buying group and two or three of the largest wholesalers decided no longer to do business with Trxade, the resulting supplier void would materially and adversely affect our competitiveness in the marketplace.
Intellectual Property.
 
Although we believe that our name and brand are protected by applicable state common law trademark laws, we do not currently have any registered trademarks, patents, concessions, licenses, royalty agreements, or franchises other than Trxade (and pending trademarks on RxGuru and our pharmaceutical pricing benchmarks, PAC). Our business operates under a proprietary software system which includes trade secrets within our database, business practices and pricing model.
Need for Government Approval of Products and Services.
 
We are required to hold business licenses and to follow applicable state and federal government regulations detailed herein. In October 2018, we acquired Community Specialty Pharmacy, LLC, an accredited independent retail pharmacy with a focus on specialty medications, which requires state approval, which we have obtained.
 
Effect of Existing or Probable Government Regulations on the Business.
 
Federal Drug Administration Guidelines
 
On April 12, 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed into law the Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 (PDMA), setting the baseline for wholesale distribution regulations. The final regulations were published in 1999, establishing the minimum wholesale distribution requirements for state licensure. With the intent to prevent the introduction and retail sale of substandard, ineffective, or counterfeit drugs into the distribution system, state licensing systems moved to update their standards to match those provided federally as guided under FDA’s Guidelines for State Licensing of Wholesale Prescription Drug Distributors (21 CFR 205). PDMA established minimum federal pedigree requirements to trace the ownership of prescription drugs through the supply chain. The principal goal of the PDMA was to further secure the nation’s drug supply from counterfeit and substandard prescription drugs. The law establishes two types of distributors: “Authorized distributor[s] of record” or ADRs; and “Unauthorized distributor[s],” such as wholesalers. The pedigree requirement was to require each person engaged in the wholesale distribution of a prescription drug in interstate commerce, who is not the manufacturer or an authorized distributor of record for that drug, to provide a pedigree to the recipient. After meeting resistance from various stakeholders, the FDA delayed the effective date of the regulations several times, until final implementation in December 2006.
 
At the federal level the implementation of the track and trace legislation by 2018 will require the use of pharmaceutical pedigree to track the movement of pharmaceuticals along the supply chain. The costs of complying with this new legislation may be too burdensome for many of the smaller suppliers.
 
State Drug Administration Guidelines
 
There are a number of national and state-wide regulations that have an effect on our business. All drug wholesalers must be licensed under state licensing systems, which must in turn meet the FDA guidelines under State Licensing of Wholesale Prescription Drug Distributors (21 CFR Part 205). The regulations set forth minimum requirements for prescription drug storage and security as well as for the treatment of returned, damaged, and outdated prescription drugs. Further, wholesale drug distributors must establish and maintain inventories and records of all transactions regarding the receipt and distribution of prescription drugs and make these available for inspection and copying by authorized federal, state, or local law enforcement officials. In most states, wholesale distributor licenses are issued by the State Boards of Pharmacy and require periodic renewal. Approximately 40 states also require out-of-state wholesalers that distribute drugs within their borders to be licensed as well.
 
California, Florida, Nevada, New Mexico and Indiana define the normal distribution channel to not include the lateral sales of pharmaceuticals between wholesalers. The new Supply Chain Act, part of the Quality Drug Act, which was signed into federal law in December 2013, precludes all states from restricting, investigating or inspecting the distribution channel and transactional history. Until the federal government provides guidelines for the new federal law, no state regulation or guideline exists.

The warehousing of pharmaceuticals is also restricted and requires additional state licenses. Some licenses require bonds and written exams and may take some time to approve. Currently, Westminster Pharmaceuticals, our wholesale distributor, asks for formal pedigrees from the ADR wholesalers and provides pedigrees to those entities they sell to in the marketplace. This requirement limits liability and provides assurance if a recall is warranted that Trxade and its participants will receive value for the commodity.
 
Research and Development.
 
During the last two fiscal years, Trxade.com, InventoryRx.com, Pharmabayonline and RxGuru have been developed as proprietary software. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, $949,948 and $863,324, respectively, was spent by the company in technology activities, these were included in General and Administrative expenses. None of these expenses were borne directly by customers.
Cost of Compliance with Environmental Laws.
 
Our operations are subject to regulations under various federal, state, local and foreign laws concerning the environment, including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions and third-party damage or personal injury claims, if in the future we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws. We are not aware of any costs or effects of our compliance with environmental laws.
Employees
 
Currently, we have 31 full time employees and 1 part time employee. We also utilize numerous outside consultants. Our future success will depend partially on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
Seasonality
 
Our business is not directly affected by seasonal fluctuations but is affected indirectly by the fall and winter flu season, to the extent it leads to in increased demand for certain generic pharmaceuticals.
