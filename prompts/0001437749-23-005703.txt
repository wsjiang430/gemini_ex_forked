ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
--------+----------

Overview
 
We are a rare disease company melding science, data and patient need to create transformational therapies for diseases with limited or no treatment options.  With unique, data-driven clinical, regulatory, and commercialization strategies, we are overcoming complex drug development challenges to bring much-needed therapies to patients. We have a diverse portfolio of products and product candidates, which includes a combination of both a clinical stage pipeline and commercial stage assets. The Company’s pipeline includes arimoclomol, an orally-delivered, first in-class investigational product candidate being developed for Niemann-Pick disease Type C, or NPC, which has been granted orphan drug designation, Fast-Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation and rare pediatric disease designation for the treatment of NPC by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and orphan medicinal product designation for the treatment of NPC by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA .KP1077, is our lead clinical development product candidate, which is being developed as a treatment for idiopathic hypersomnia, or IH, a rare neurological sleep disorder, and narcolepsy. KP1077 is comprised solely of serdexmethylphenidate, or SDX, our proprietary prodrug of d-methylphenidate, or d-MPH.  The FDA has granted KP1077 orphan drug designation for the treatment of IH, and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA, has classified SDX as a Schedule IV controlled substance based on evidence suggesting SDX has a lower potential for abuse when compared to d-MPH, a Schedule II controlled substance. 
 
We have specialized expertise and a track record of success in advancing promising therapies that face complex clinical and regulatory challenges with an approach that balances science and data with patient need. The FDA, has approved AZSTARYS®, formerly referred to as KP415, a once-daily treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, in patients age six years and older containing our prodrug, SDX, and d-MPH. In September 2019, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement, or the AZSTARYS License Agreement, with Commave Therapeutics SA (formerly known as Boston Pharmaceutical S.A.), or Commave, an affiliate of Gurnet Point Capital, L.P. Under the AZSTARYS License Agreement, we granted to Commave an exclusive, worldwide license, to develop, manufacture, and commercialize AZSTARYS and any of our product candidates containing SDX and used to treat ADHD or any other CNS disease. Commave has tasked Corium, Inc., or Corium, an affiliate of Gurnet Point Capital, L.P., to lead all commercialization activities for AZSTARYS in the U.S. under the AZSTARYS License Agreement. Corium commercially launched AZSTARYS in the U.S. during the third quarter of 2021. In December 2021, Commave sublicensed commercialization rights for AZSTARYS in greater China to Shanghai Ark Biopharmaceutical Ltd. The FDA has also approved APADAZ®, an immediate-release combination product containing benzhydrocodone, our prodrug of hydrocodone, and acetaminophen, for the short-term (no more than 14 days) management of acute pain severe enough to require opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. In October 2018, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement, or the APADAZ License Agreement, with KVK-Tech, Inc., or KVK, under which we granted to KVK the exclusive license to manufacture and commercialize APADAZ in the U.S.
 
Our primary mission is to deliver life-changing treatments to people with rare conditions, their families, and caregivers who desperately need better options.  This mission guides our efforts to expand our pipeline through both internal development and through our business development activities to collaborate, partner, and potentially acquire additional assets. We intend to target assets that will allow us to leverage the expertise and infrastructure that we have successfully built in order to mitigate risk and enhance our probability of success. In addition, we are considering external opportunities within neurology and neurodegenerative diseases, psychiatric disorders, and other rare diseases, along with adjacent or related therapeutic categories.  We are seeking assets that are undergoing Phase 2 clinical trials or Phase 3 clinical trials, subject to our specific evaluation criteria, that we can in-license or acquire.  If we are successful, expanding our development pipeline could be accretive to our value proposition by potentially adding new clinical data catalysts and have the potential to create incremental long-term value for stockholders.  In addition, we believe that a multi-channel development program with several product candidates addressing various rare disease indications will diversify risk and potentially create an impactful portfolio of commercial-stage products in the future.
 
For example, in May 2022, we, through our newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary, Zevra Denmark A/S (formerly known as KemPharm Denmark A/S prior to February 21, 2023), or Zevra DK, entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, or the Arimoclomol Purchase Agreement, with Orphazyme A/S in restructuring, a Danish public limited liability company, or Orphazyme. The transactions agreed to under the Arimoclomol Purchase Agreement closed on May 31, 2022. Under the terms of the Arimoclomol Purchase Agreement, Zevra DK purchased all of the assets and operations of Orphazyme related to arimoclomol and settled all of Orphazyme’s actual outstanding liabilities to its creditors with a cash payment of $12.8 million. In addition, Zevra DK agreed to assume an estimated reserve liability of $5.2 million related to revenue generated from Orphazyme’s Early Access Program in France, or the Arimoclomol EAP.
 
Our most advanced product candidate, arimoclomol, is being developed for the treatment of NPC, a lysosomal storage disease, or LSD. NPC is a rare neurodegenerative disease characterized by an inability of the body to transport cholesterol and lipids inside of cells. Symptoms of NPC include a progressive impairment of mobility, cognition, speech, and swallowing, often culminating in premature death. The incidence of NPC is estimated to be one in 100,000 live births. We estimate that approximately 1,500 individuals have been diagnosed, of which approximately 300 are in the United States and approximately 1,200 are in Europe. However, diagnostic challenges may affect the number of potential patients, and we believe that the availability of treatment options could increase awareness of the disease and assist in identifying more cases. Therapies to treat NPC are desperately needed, and for this reason, arimoclomol is currently being made available to NPC patients in the United States, France, Germany, and other European Union countries under various early access programs, or EAPs.
 
On September 16, 2020, the previous sponsor of the arimoclomol program, Orphazyme, submitted a new drug application, or NDA, seeking approval for arimoclomol to treat NPC. In June 2021, the FDA issued a complete response letter, or CRL, which means the FDA determined that it could not approve the NDA in its present form. Our aim is to prepare and resubmit an NDA that presents meaningful evidence of safety and efficacy of arimoclomol for its intended use. To that end, we are continuing to work diligently to characterize the substantial data generated since the CRL, including the recently completed four-year open-label safety trial which was recently presented at the 19th WorldSymposiumTM in February 2023. Results from this analysis, based on up to four years of continuous treatment, suggested that arimoclomol may reduce the long-term progression of NPC. Upon fulfilling the randomized double-blinded portion of the Phase 2/3 clinical trial, both placebo- and arimoclomol-treated patients were given the option to continue into the four-year (48 month) open-label-extension, or OLE, phase of the study with arimoclomol treatment provided in addition to their current standard of care. Progression of NPC disease through the DB and OLE phases was assessed utilizing the five-domain NPC Clinical Severity Scale (5DNPCCSS) and compared with an estimated progression calculated from the combination of untreated patients from the NPC-001 observational trial and placebo patients from the NPC-002 Phase 2/3 trial. We are also investigating correlations between relevant 5DNPCCSS domains and corresponding Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia, or SARA, test items to potentially provide further supportive evidence for 5DNPCCSS validity as a tool for evaluating NPC progression. The SARA test evaluates impairment related to cerebellar ataxia, which was a secondary endpoint in the Phase 2/3 clinical trial of arimoclomol in NPC (NPC progression based on the 5DNPCCSS was the primary endpoint).  Based on a comparative analysis of both measurements, it was determined that individual 5DNPCCSS domains and relevant performance-based SARA test items showed strong associations and alignment between the two instruments for all analysis methods used. These results provided further support that the evaluated 5DNPCCSS domains are appropriately standardized to allow for reliable and reproducible scoring of disease severity in NPC. We plan to include these data as part of the updated NDA for arimoclomol, which is expected to resubmitted to the FDA as early as the third quarter of 2023.

We also intend to advance our pipeline of prodrug product candidates for the treatment of IH and other CNS/rare diseases, and we reported top-line data from a Phase 1 proof-of-concept study of SDX in the fourth quarter of 2021 and final data for the Phase 1 proof-of-concept study of SDX in the first quarter of 2022. The proof-of-concept study was a dose-escalation study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic stimulant effects, and safety of single oral doses of SDX in subjects with a history of high-dose stimulant use. In the trial, 240 mg and 360 mg doses of SDX were observed to be well-tolerated and produced d-MPH exposure that appeared to increase proportionally with dose. Mean d-MPH plasma concentrations showed a gradual increase after SDX administration, reaching a broad peak from eight to twelve hours post-dose, followed by a shallow decline thereafter. Increased wakefulness, alertness, hypervigilance, and insomnia effects were reported by study participants, which we believe suggests that SDX produced targeted pharmacodynamic effects that have the potential to benefit patients with IH and other sleep disorders. On November 18, 2022, we announced that the FDA has granted the Orphan Drug Designation to SDX for the treatment of IH.
 
In January 2022, we announced that we have selected KP1077 for the treatment of IH and narcolepsy as our lead clinical development candidate. KP1077 utilizes SDX, our prodrug of d-MPH, as its active pharmaceutical ingredient. During the first quarter of 2022, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial comparing the cardiovascular safety of SDX to immediate-release and long-acting formulations of RITALIN®, a commonly prescribed CNS stimulant. In September 2022, we announced topline data from our exploratory Phase 1 clinical trial, which showed the potential for higher dose formulations of SDX to be safe and well tolerated while avoiding the potential for greater cardiovascular safety risk compared to immediate-release and long-acting formulations of Ritalin. Based on the data, we have identified initial dosing strengths for the planned Phase 2 clinical trial of KP1077 which we believe have the potential to be well-tolerated while providing higher overall exposures to d-MPH compared to other methylphenidate products that are often used off-label as a treatment for IH. In addition, on December 21, 2022, we announced the initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating KP1077. The Phase 2 clinical trial is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized-withdrawal, dose-optimizing, multi-center study evaluating the efficacy and safety of KP1077 for the treatment of IH. We expect to enroll approximately 48 adult patients with IH in more than 30 centers in the United States. Part 1 of the trial will consist of a five-week open-label titration phase during which patients will be optimized to one of four doses of SDX (80, 160, 240, or 320 mg/day). Part 2 of the trial will entail a two-week randomized, double-blind, withdrawal phase, during which two-thirds of the trial participants will continue to receive their optimized dose while the remaining one-third will receive placebo. Participants will be further assigned into two evenly divided cohorts. The first cohort will receive a single daily dose just before bedtime, and the second cohort will receive half the daily dose shortly after awakening and half the daily dose prior to bedtime. Interim efficacy and safety data for the Phase 2 trial is expected as early as the third quarter of 2023. We anticipate that we will submit the IND for KP1077 for the treatment of narcolepsy as early as the second quarter of 2023, and subsequently begin a trial in narcolepsy soon after interim data from the Phase 2 IH clinical trial is available.
 
In May 2021, we announced that SDX, our proprietary prodrug of d-MPH and the primary active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, in AZSTARYS, was classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance by the DEA. AZSTARYS is classified as a Schedule II controlled substance as its formulation includes a 70:30 mixture of SDX (Schedule IV) and d-MPH (Schedule II), respectively.
 
Our Proprietary Ligand Activated Therapy Platform Technology
 
We employ our proprietary Ligand Activated Therapy, or LAT® , platform technology to discover and develop prodrugs that are new molecules that may potentially improve one or more of the attributes of approved drugs, such as enhanced bioavailability, extended duration of action, increased safety and reduced susceptibility to abuse. A prodrug is a precursor chemical compound of a drug that is inactive or less than fully active, which is then converted in the body to the active form of the drug through a normal metabolic process. Where possible, we seek, to develop prodrugs that will be eligible for approval under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FFDCA, otherwise known as a 505(b)(2) NDA, which allows us to submit an NDA that relies on the FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness for one or more approved products, if we demonstrate such reliance is scientifically appropriate.
 
We believe that our proprietary LAT platform technology offers the following potential benefits:
 

● | Improved drug properties. We seek to discover and develop prodrugs that are new molecules with potentially improved attributes over FDA-approved drugs, such as enhanced bioavailability, extended duration of action, increased safety and reduced susceptibility to abuse. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Composition-of-matter patent protection. Our prodrugs are new molecules and thus may be eligible for patent protection as novel compositions of matter, provided that all other applicable requirements are met. We seek patent protection not only for our product candidates, but also for related compounds with the intention of creating potential heightened barriers to market entry. 
● | Eligibility for 505(b)(2) NDA pathway. Our proprietary LAT platform technology allows us to discover and develop prodrugs that may be eligible to use the 505(b)(2) NDA pathway. Under that regulatory pathway, if we are able to provide an adequate bridge between our product candidates and appropriate FDA-approved drugs, we will then be able to reference the FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness of the approved drugs in our 505(b)(2) NDA submissions. This approach may allow us to avoid some of the significant time and expense of conducting large clinical trials and potentially eliminate the need for some preclinical activities.

 
We continue to seek opportunities to expand our pipeline of product candidates through our business development efforts, and by employing our LAT platform technology and development expertise to develop additional product candidates that address significant unmet medical needs in therapeutic indications which have few existing product options. We believe our prodrug product candidates may be eligible for composition-of-matter patent protection and we intend to use the 505(b)(2) NDA pathway when available, which we believe has the potential to reduce drug development time and expense.

 | These anticipated milestones are based on information currently available to us. Our current plans and expectations are subject to a number of uncertainties, risks and other important factors that could materially impact our plans, including risks which are not solely within our control. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Arimoclomol
 
Arimoclomol is an orally-delivered, first-in-class investigational product candidate being developed as a treatment for NPC. NPC is a rare neurodegenerative disease characterized by an inability of the body to transport cholesterol and lipids inside of cells. Symptoms of NPC include a progressive impairment of mobility, cognition, speech, and swallowing, often culminating in premature death. The incidence of NPC is estimated to be one in 100,000 live births. Based on these incidence rates, the number of NPC patients in the United States, France, Germany, and other European Union countries is estimated to be approximately 1,800 individuals. Of these, we estimate that approximately 1,500 individuals have been diagnosed, of which approximately 300 are in the United States and approximately 1,200 are in Europe. However, diagnostic challenges may affect the number of potential patients, and we believe that the availability of treatment options could increase awareness of the disease and assist in identifying more cases. Therapies to treat NPC are desperately needed, and for this reason, arimoclomol is currently being made available to NPC patients in the United States, France, Germany, and other European Union countries under various early access programs, or EAPs.
 
On September 16, 2020, the previous sponsor of the arimoclomol program, Orphazyme, submitted an NDA seeking approval of arimoclomol for the treatment of NPC. In June 2021, the FDA issued a CRL, which means the FDA determined that it could not approve the NDA in its present form. Our aim is to prepare and resubmit an NDA that presents meaningful evidence of safety and efficacy of arimoclomol for its intended use. To that end, we are continuing to work diligently to characterize the substantial data generated since the CRL, including the recently completed four-year open-label safety trial. We expect to resubmit the arimoclomol NDA to the FDA as early as the third quarter of 2023.
 
Arimoclomol has received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA for the treatment of NPC and orphan medicinal product designation from the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of NPC, as well as Fast-Track Designation, Breakthrough Therapy Designation, and Rare Pediatric Disease Designation from the FDA, each for the treatment of NPC.

KP1077
 
KP1077 is based on SDX and is our lead prodrug product candidate in development for the treatment of IH, an underserved indication. IH is a rare neurological sleep disorder affecting approximately 37,000 patients in the United States. The cardinal feature of IH is excessive daytime sleepiness, or EDS, characterized by daytime lapses into sleep, or an irrepressible need to sleep that persists even with adequate or prolonged nighttime sleep.  Additionally, those with IH have extreme difficulty waking, otherwise known as “sleep inertia,” suffer from severe and debilitating brain fog, and may fall asleep unintentionally or at inappropriate times, also known as narcolepsy. These symptoms often further lead to reported memory problems, difficulty maintaining focus, and depression. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial in the U.S. investigating KP1077 as a treatment for IH. Interim safety and efficacy data are expected in the third quarter of 2023 and top-line data are expected by year end 2023. We plan to use our learnings from the ongoing Phase 2 trial to design Phase 3 clinical studies of SDX, the sole pharmaceutical agent in KP1077, in IH and narcolepsy with or without cataplexy. We intend to submit an IND for KP1077 for the treatment of narcolepsy as early as the second quarter of 2023, and subsequently begin a trial in narcolepsy soon after interim data from the Phase 2 IH clinical trial is available.
 
There is currently only one approved product for the treatment of IH, XYWAV®, developed by Jazz Pharmaceuticals. A second product, WAKIX®, developed by Harmony Biosciences and originally approved for the treatment of EDS or cataplexy in adult patients with narcolepsy, is planned to be studied in a Phase 3 trial with IH patients. Prescribers also utilize narcolepsy medications and various stimulant products “off-label” to treat IH symptoms, with methylphenidate, a Schedule IV controlled substance, being one of the most commonly used stimulants for treating IH. While each of these medications can help to address certain IH symptoms, there are also potential shortcomings, including dosing inconvenience, serious adverse events, such as elevated blood pressure and heart rate, and significant drug-to-drug interactions, or DDIs, including with medications used to manage contraception and depression.  In addition, patients have indicated that the effectiveness of their current medication was poor.
 
Narcolepsy is a rare, chronic, debilitating neurologic disorder of sleep-wake state instability that impacts up to 200,000 Americans and is primarily characterized by EDS and cataplexy (sudden loss of muscle tone while a person is awake) along with other manifestations of rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep dysregulation, which intrude into wakefulness. In most patients, narcolepsy is caused by the loss of hypocretin, a neuropeptide in the brain that supports sleep-wake state stability. Typical symptom onset occurs in adolescence or young adulthood, but it can take up to a decade to be properly diagnosed. Although there are several approved medications for narcolepsy, we believe a treatment option based on SDX, our proprietary prodrug of d-MPH, with superior exposure/duration characteristics and low abuse potential may be beneficial.
 
Based on our preclinical and clinical data, we believe KP1077, if approved by the FDA, may have valuable product features and may provide significant benefits to patients and physicians:
 

● | Dosing flexibility. Either one or two doses daily, which is designed to address the two primary issues associated with IH: (i) nighttime dose would address sleep inertia, and (ii) morning dose would address daytime brain fog. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | No drug-to-drug interactions. Our data indicate that there is no drug-to-drug interaction potential, especially with hormonal contraceptives and antidepressants. 
● | Reduced abuse potential as a Schedule IV controlled substance. All other methylphenidate-based products have been designated as Schedule II controlled substances, which indicates stricter control over the prescribing and use of such products. KP1077 is based on SDX, which has been designated a Schedule IV controlled substance. 
● | No generic equivalent product. KP1077 contains SDX, our proprietary prodrug of d-methylphenidate that was given a new chemical name, serdexmethylphenidate, by the USAN, which means that there may be no generic equivalent product for KP1077 in most states, making drug-equivalent substitution potentially difficult at the pharmacy. 
● | Composition-of-matter patent protection. KP1077 is generally protected by a U.S. composition-of-matter patent that will expire, after utilizing all appropriate patent term adjustments but excluding possible term extensions, in 2037. 
● | Orphan drug designation potential. Because there are limited treatments available for the extremely small IH patient population, KP1077 may be eligible to receive the orphan drug designation by the FDA, as well as fast-track and breakthrough therapy designation eligibility, which may provide various regulatory benefits for the development program.

 
KP879
 
KP879 is based on SDX and is our product candidate in development for the treatment of stimulant use disorder, or SUD, including, for example, abuse or misuse of cocaine, methamphetamine and prescription stimulants. Currently there are no approved drugs in the United States for SUD. We submitted an IND to the FDA for KP879 in December 2020. In January 2021, the FDA completed its review of the KP879 IND, concluding that we may proceed with its planned clinical investigation of the product candidate. We initiated the clinical program in October 2021, reported top-line data from a Phase 1 proof-of-concept study for KP879 in the fourth quarter of 2021 and final data from the Phase 1 proof-of-concept study for KP879 in the first quarter of 2022.
 
In the second quarter of 2022, we conducted a second Phase 1 trial to evaluate the cardiovascular safety of KP879 compared to immediate-release Ritalin and Ritalin LA in healthy volunteers, and reported top-line data in the third quarter of 2022. In this study, the doses of SDX evaluated were observed to be well-tolerated. d-MPH was observed to have been released as designed and in a manner which we believe to be well-suited for further study in patients with SUD but also in patients with sleep disorders characterized with EDS (see KP1077 above).
 
In January 2023, we submitted a grant proposal to the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) for a Phase 1 study in cocaine-dependent volunteers to evaluate the safety of concomitant administration of KP879 and cocaine, in preparation of a Phase 3 trial thereafter. If the grant is approved, a Phase 1 study is planned to be conducted subsequently.

AZSTARYS
 
Overview
 
AZSTARYS contains dexmethylphenidate and our prodrug, SDX. On March 2, 2021, the FDA approved the NDA for AZSTARYS in patients age six years and older. In May 2021, we announced that SDX, our proprietary prodrug of d-MPH and the primary API in AZSTARYS, was classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance by the DEA. AZSTARYS is classified as a Schedule II controlled substance as its formulation includes a 70:30 mixture of SDX (Schedule IV) and d-MPH (Schedule II), respectively.
 
In September 2019, we entered into the AZSTARYS License Agreement with Commave. Under the AZSTARYS License Agreement, we granted to Commave an exclusive, worldwide license, to develop, manufacture, and commercialize AZSTARYS and any of our product candidates containing SDX for the treatment of ADHD. Commave has tasked Corium with leading all commercialization activities for AZSTARYS in the United States under the AZSTARYS License Agreement. Corium commercially launched AZSTARYS in the United States during the third quarter of 2021.
 
Pursuant to the AZSTARYS License Agreement, Commave agreed to pay up to $63.0 million in milestone payments upon the occurrence of specified regulatory milestones related to the AZSTARYS, including FDA approval and specified conditions with respect to the final approval label. In addition, Corium agreed to make additional payments upon the achievement of specified U.S. sales milestones of up to $420 million in the aggregate. Further, Commave will pay us quarterly, tiered royalty payments based on a percentage of net sales on a product-by-product basis. Corium also agreed to be responsible for and reimburse us for all of development, commercialization and regulatory expenses for any products or product candidates containing SDX, subject to certain limitations as set forth in the AZSTARYS License Agreement, including consultation fees to be paid to us for services provided to Corium in performing such activities.
 
In April 2021, we entered into the AZSTARYS Amendment. Pursuant to the AZSTARYS Amendment, we and Corium agreed to modify the compensation terms of the AZSTARYS License Agreement. Corium paid us $10.0 million in connection with the entry into the AZSTARYS Amendment as a result of the FDA approval of AZSTARYS in the United States. Corium also paid us $10.0 million following the receipt of the scheduling determination of the compound SDX by the DEA, which occurred on May 7, 2021. In addition, the AZSTARYS Amendment increased the total remaining future regulatory and sales milestone payments related to AZSTARYS up to an aggregate of $590.0 million.
 
The AZSTARYS License Agreement will continue on a product-by-product basis (i) until expiration of the royalty term for the applicable product candidate in the United States and (ii) perpetually for all other countries.
 
APADAZ
 
Overview
 

APADAZ is approved by the FDA for the short-term (no more than 14 days) management of acute pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. APADAZ is an IR combination of our prodrug, benzhydrocodone, and acetaminophen, or APAP. APADAZ contains benzhydrocodone, a Schedule II controlled substance. Benzhydrocodone was developed with our proprietary LAT platform technology.
 
In October 2018, we entered into the APADAZ License Agreement with KVK pursuant to which we have granted an exclusive license to KVK to conduct regulatory activities for the manufacture and commercialization of APADAZ in the United States. We have retained the right to license the international commercial rights to APADAZ to one or more collaborators outside of the U.S.  We will be solely responsible for all development activities except for regulatory activities relating to APADAZ in the United States.
 
Pursuant to the APADAZ License Agreement, KVK agreed to pay us certain payments and cost reimbursements of an estimated total of $3.4 million, which includes a payment of $2.0 million within 10 days of the achievement of a specified milestone related to the initial formulary adoption of APADAZ, or the Initial Adoption Milestone. In addition, KVK has agreed to make additional payments to us upon the achievement of specified sales milestones of up to $53.0 million in the aggregate. Further, we and KVK will share the quarterly net profits of APADAZ by KVK in the United States at specified tiered percentages, ranging from us receiving 30% to 50% of net profits, based on the amount of net sales on a rolling four quarter basis. We are responsible for a portion of commercialization and regulatory expenses for APADAZ until the Initial Adoption Milestone is achieved, after which KVK will be responsible for all expenses incurred in connection with commercialization and maintaining regulatory approval in the United States.
 
In November 2019, APADAZ and its authorized generic became nationally available. To date, KVK has utilized targeted non-traditional efforts to build product awareness for APADAZ as a responsible alternative to currently available hydrocodone/acetaminophen products and there has been limited adoption of the product by prescribers.

As of December 31, 2022, we had 19 pending patent applications under active prosecution in the United States, and an additional 117 pending foreign patent applications potentially covering our selected prodrugs and product candidates. Our issued and granted patents provide protection in jurisdictions that include the United States, Australia, Canada, Chile, China, European Countries, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, Romania, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, and Vietnam.
 
We have received composition-of-matter patents and also additionally filed composition-of-matter and method of treatment patent applications related to the AZSTARYS families in the United States and in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Egypt, Hong Kong, European Countries, India, Israel, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Thailand, Ukraine, and Vietnam. We anticipate filing additional patent applications for our prodrugs and product candidates.
 
Since 2013, the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, has issued 14 composition-of-matter or method of treatment patents covering benzhydrocodone, which will expire, after utilizing all appropriate patent term adjustments but excluding possible patent term extensions, no earlier than 2030. Further, there are granted or recently allowed compositions-of-matter patents covering benzhydrocodone in Australia, Canada, Chile, China, Israel, Mexico, South Africa, and South Korea. Patent applications covering benzhydrocodone were pending as of December 31, 2022, in Thailand and Vietnam.
 
We have additionally received method of use and method of treatment patents, and have filed related patent applications, related to the arimoclomol families (pursuant to the recent acquisition of Orphazyme) in various jurisdictions, including the United States, European countries, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Canada, China, Brazil, Russia and Turkey, with anticipated patent expiration date of 2029, excluding any potential patent term adjustments or extensions. We anticipate filing additional patent applications related to the arimoclomol families.
 
We also depend upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors. To help protect our LAT platform technology, as well as any proprietary know-how and show-how beyond that which is patentable, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we generally require our employees, consultants and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements prohibiting the disclosure of confidential information and, in some cases, requiring disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries, inventions and improvements important to our business.
 
Commercialization
 

In March 2021, we announced that the FDA approved the NDA for AZSTARYS, a once-daily product for the treatment of ADHD in patients ranging from six years and older. Corium is leading the commercialization of AZSTARYS per the AZSTARYS License Agreement. Corium commercially launched AZSTARYS in the United States during the third quarter of 2021.
 
In February 2018, we announced that the FDA approved APADAZ for the short-term (no more than 14 days) management of acute pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate.  In October 2018, we entered into the APADAZ License Agreement with KVK pursuant to which we have granted an exclusive license to KVK to conduct regulatory activities for, manufacture and commercialize APADAZ in the United States. In November 2019, APADAZ and its authorized generic (AG-APADAZ) became nationally available. To date, KVK has utilized targeted non-traditional efforts to build product awareness for APADAZ as a responsible alternative to currently available hydrocodone/acetaminophen products and there has been limited adoption of the product by prescribers.
 
With the exception of AZSTARYS and APADAZ, commercialization activities for our product candidates in active development have not yet begun. It is our intention to build a small, nimble commercial team which will be able to fully service the patients and prescribers within the rare disease indications for which we are successful in gaining approval for our product candidates.  However, if our product candidates have large potential market opportunities that would require significant marketing resources, we may conclude that the most appropriate approach to their commercialization, if they receive regulatory approval, will involve forming a commercial collaboration or strategic relationship similar to those we have entered into with Corium and KVK, or consummating some type of strategic transaction, with a larger pharmaceutical or other marketing organization. As we get closer to potential approval of our product candidates which are not currently subject to the AZSTARYS License Agreement, we will work to identify and implement the commercialization strategies that we conclude are the most desirable with regard to the specific product candidates.

Competition
 
Our industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We will face competition and potential competition from a number of sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, generic drug companies, drug delivery companies and academic and research institutions. Our competitors may develop or market drugs that are more effective, more convenient, more widely used and less costly or have a better safety profile than our products or product candidates and these competitors may also have significantly more resources than us and be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products.
 
While there are currently no approved products for the treatment of NPC in the U.S., if approved, we expect the most direct competitor with respect to arimoclomol to be ZAVESCA (miglustat), which was originally developed by Actelion Pharmaceuticals and is now owned by Johnson & Johnson. Miglustat is available as a generic product in several countries, including the U.S., where it is currently approved for the treatment of another LSD, Gaucher disease. Miglustat is currently approved for the treatment of NPC in Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and several countries in Asia and South America where it is marketed as ZAVESCA, and marketed as BRAZAVES in Japan.
 
If approved, we intend for KP1077 to compete against Jazz Pharmaceuticals’ XYWAV, and potentially with other products that are currently in development for the treatment of IH, including Harmony Biosciences’ WAKIX.  KP1077 could face potential competition from any products for the treatment of IH that are currently in or which may enter into clinical development.
 
Currently, there are no approved drugs in the United States for the treatment of SUD. If approved, KP879 will face potential competition from any products for the treatment of SUD that are currently in, or which may enter into, clinical development.
 
AZSTARYS competes against currently marketed, branded and generic methylphenidate products for the treatment of ADHD. Some of these currently marketed products include Janssen’s CONCERTA, Supernus' QUELBREE, Tris Pharma’s QUILLIVANT XR and QUILLICHEW ER, Novartis’ RITALIN, FOCALIN and FOCALIN XR, UCB’s METADATE CD, Noven’s DAYTRANA, Neos Therapeutics’ CONTEMPLA XR-ODT, Ironshore Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s JORNAY PM and Adlon Therapeutics’ ADHANSIA XR, in addition to multiple other branded and generic methylphenidate products. In addition, AZSTARYS will face potential competition from any other methylphenidate products for the treatment of ADHD that are currently in or which may enter into clinical development.
 
APADAZ competes against currently marketed, branded and generic hydrocodone/APAP products for short-term (no more than 14 days) management of acute pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. In addition, APADAZ may face potential competition from any other hydrocodone/APAP products for short-term (no more than 14 days) management of acute pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate that are currently in or which may enter into clinical development.
 
Manufacturing
 
Our manufacturing strategy is to rely on contract manufacturers to produce our product candidates for clinical trials and, if approved, drug product for commercial sale. We currently have no manufacturing facilities and limited personnel with manufacturing experience. We have contracted with a third-party manufacturer to supply arimoclomol, and to supply SDX, which is the primary API for KP1077 and KP879, to be used in our non-clinical, clinical and formulation development programs necessary to support an NDA submission. We expect to contract with third-party manufacturers for the manufacture of all API supply needs outside the United States if and when we receive approval from regulatory authorities outside the United States.
 
Our current and any future third-party manufacturers, their facilities and all lots of drug substance and drug products used in our clinical trials are required to be in compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports, and returned or salvaged products. The manufacturing facilities for our products must meet cGMP requirements and FDA satisfaction before any product is approved and we can manufacture commercial products. Our current and any future third-party manufacturers are also subject to periodic inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with applicable regulations.
 
Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold or termination of clinical trials, warning letters, untitled letters, cyber letters, modification of promotional materials or labeling, product recalls, product seizures or detentions, refusal to allow imports or exports, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, debarment, injunctions, fines, consent decrees, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreements to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, refusals of government contracts and new orders under existing contracts, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties, including fines and individual imprisonments.

Third-Party Payor Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors, such as state and federal governmental authorities, including those that administer the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and private managed care organizations and health insurers. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for each of our product and product candidates is and will be made on a plan-by-plan basis. One payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage, and adequate reimbursement, for the product. Each third-party payor determines whether or not it will provide coverage for a drug, what amount it will pay providers for the drug, and on what tier of its formulary the drug will be placed. These decisions are influenced by the existence of multiple drug products within a therapeutic class and the net cost to the plan, including the amount of the prescription price, if any, rebated by the drug’s manufacturer. Typically, generic versions of drugs are placed in a preferred tier. The position of a drug on the formulary generally determines the co-payment that a patient will need to make to obtain the drug and can strongly influence the adoption of a drug by patients and physicians. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided, and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Additionally, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Also, third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. As a result, coverage, reimbursement and placement determinations are complex and are often the subject of extensive negotiations between the payor and the owner of the drug.
 
Unless we enter into a strategic collaboration under which our collaborator assumes responsibility for seeking coverage and reimbursement for a given product, we will be responsible for negotiating coverage, reimbursement and placement decisions for our product candidates, if approved. Coverage, reimbursement and placement decisions for a new product are based on many factors including the coverage, reimbursement and placement of already marketed branded drugs for the same or similar indications, the safety and efficacy of the new product, availability of generics for similar indications, the clinical need for the new product and the cost-effectiveness of the product. Increasingly, both purchasers and payors are also conducting comparative clinical and cost effectiveness analyses involving application of metrics, including data on patient outcomes, provided by manufacturers.
 
Within the Medicare program, as self-administered drugs, our product and product candidates would be reimbursed under the expanded prescription drug benefit known as Medicare Part D. This program is a voluntary Medicare benefit administered by private plans that operate under contracts with the federal government. These plans develop formularies that determine which products are covered and what co-pay will apply to covered drugs. The plans have considerable discretion in establishing formularies and tiered co-pay structures, negotiating rebates with manufacturers and placing prior authorization and other restrictions on the utilization of specific products, subject to review by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, for discriminatory practices. These Part D plans negotiate discounts with drug manufacturers, which are passed on, in whole or in part, to each of the plan’s enrollees through reduced premiums. Historically, Part D beneficiaries have been exposed to significant out-of-pocket costs after they surpass an annual coverage limit and until they reach a catastrophic coverage threshold. However, changes made by recent legislation will reduce this patient coverage gap, known as the “donut hole”, by transitioning patient responsibility in that coverage range from 100% in 2010 to only 25% currently. To help achieve this reduction, pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to provide quarterly discounts of 70%, which commenced January 1, 2019. In 2020, drug manufacturers became be responsible for a larger share of total drug costs due to an increase to the catastrophic threshold. Such increase will also result in a higher out-of-pocket threshold paid by Part D beneficiaries.
 
If a drug product is available for reimbursement by Medicare or Medicaid, its manufacturer must comply with various health regulatory requirements and price reporting metrics, which may include, as applicable, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, or the OBRA, and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, or the VHCA, each as amended. Among other things, the OBRA requires drug manufacturers with certain drugs covered by Medicaid to pay rebates on prescription drugs to state Medicaid programs. States may also negotiate “supplemental” Medicaid rebates on drug products dispensed under Medicaid. Manufacturers participating in Medicaid are also generally required to participate in the Public Health Service 340B Drug Discount Program, which imposes a mandatory discount on purchases by certain customers. Manufacturers of innovator drugs, including 505(b)(2) drugs, that participate in the Medicaid program are also required to offer the drugs on the Federal Supply Schedule purchasing program of the General Services Administration for purchase by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense and other authorized users at a mandatory discount. Additional laws and requirements apply to these contracts. Participation in such federal programs may result in prices for our future products that will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain.
 
Third-party payors, including the U.S. government, continue to apply downward pressure on the reimbursement of pharmaceutical products. Also, the trend towards managed health care in the United States and the concurrent growth of organizations such as health maintenance organizations may result in lower reimbursement for pharmaceutical products. We expect that these trends will continue as these payors implement various proposals or regulatory policies, including various provisions of the recent health reform legislation that affect reimbursement of these products. There are currently, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to implement controls on reimbursement and pricing, directly and indirectly.

Government Regulation
 
The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, packaging, recordkeeping, tracking, approval, import, export, distribution, advertising and promotion of our products and product candidates. A new drug must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before it may be legally marketed in the United States. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 
The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 

● | non-clinical laboratory and animal tests that must be conducted in accordance with good laboratory practices, or GLP, requirements and other applicable regulations; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | submission of an IND, which must be received by the FDA and become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
● | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site or centrally before each trial may be initiated; 
● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed product candidate for its intended use, performed in accordance with good clinical practice requirements, or GCPs;
● | preparation and submission of a NDA to the FDA; 
● | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; 
● | pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities at which the drug is produced to assess their compliance with cGMPs and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCPs; and 
● | FDA approval of an NDA to permit commercial marketing for particular indications for use. 

Clinical Trials
 
The testing and regulatory approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of drug substance chemistry, pharmacology, toxicity and drug product formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. Prior to commencing the first human clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit the results of the preclinical tests and preclinical literature, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies.
 
The IND becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial by imposing a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development, as well as amendments to previously submitted clinical trials. Further, an independent IRB for each study site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial, its informed consent form and other communications to study subjects before the clinical trial commences at that site. The IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted, including any changes to the study plans. Regulatory authorities, an IRB or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the FDA’s or the IRB’s requirements, if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects, or based on evolving business objectives or competitive climate. Some studies also include a data safety monitoring board, which receives special access to unblinded data during the clinical trial and may advise us to halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. Depending on its charter, this group may determine whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.  There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.
 
In general, for purposes of NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.
 

● | Phase 1 - The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are conducted to test the product candidate for safety, dosage tolerance, structure-activity relationships, mechanism of action, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. If possible, Phase 1 trials may also be used to gain early evidence of product effectiveness. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Phase 2 - The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosage and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. 
● | Phase 3 - The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded subject population at multiple clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.

 

    15 

  

In the case of a 505(b)(2) NDA, some of the above-described studies and preclinical studies may not be required or may be abbreviated. Pharmacokinetic and other bridging studies may be needed, however, to demonstrate the relevance of the studies that were previously conducted by other sponsors to the drug that is the subject of the NDA.
 
The FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved. These so-called Phase 4, or post-market, studies may be used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
 
The manufacture of investigational drugs for the conduct of human clinical trials is subject to cGMP requirements. Investigational drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients imported into the United States are also subject to regulation by the FDA relating to their labeling and distribution. Further, the export of investigational drug products outside of the United States is subject to regulatory requirements of the receiving country as well as U.S. export requirements under the FFDCA. In addition, while the IND is active and before approval, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator’s brochure.
 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 
NDA Submission and Review by the FDA
 
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical and preclinical testing, among other items, the results of product development, including chemistry, manufacture and controls, non-clinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA, along with proposed labeling, as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by independent investigators. The submission of an NDA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to the FDA. These user fees must be filed at the time of the first submission of the application, even if the application is being submitted on a rolling basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in some circumstances.
 
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA for a new active ingredient, indication, dosage form, dosage regimen or route of administration must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
 
The FDA may refer drugs which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel that typically includes clinicians and other experts who review, evaluate and make a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 
Once the FDA receives an application, it has 60 days to review the NDA to determine if it is substantially complete to permit a substantive review, before it accepts the application for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. The timeline for the FDA to complete its review of a NDA may differ based on whether the application is a standard review or priority review application. The FDA may give a priority review to applications for drugs that are intended to treat serious conditions and if approved, would provide significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of such serious conditions. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has set the review goal of ten months from the 60-day filing date to complete its initial review of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity, or NME, and make a decision on the application. For non-NME standard applications, the FDA has set the review goal of ten months from the submission date to complete its initial review and to make a decision on the application. For priority review applications, the FDA has set the review goal of reviewing NME NDAs within six months of the 60-day filing date and non-NME applications within six months of the date of receipt. Such deadlines are referred to as the PDUFA date. The review process and the PDUFA date may also be extended if the FDA requests or the NDA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding the submission.
 
The FDA reviews applications to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the manufacturing controls are adequate to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities, including contract manufacturers and subcontracts, are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs.
 
Once the FDA’s review of the application is complete, the FDA will issue either a CRL or approval letter. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application cannot be approved in its current form. A CRL will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the NDA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the CRL without first conducting required inspections and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the CRL, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the NDA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification.  Even with the submission of additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA may issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
 


    16 

  

The FDA may delay or refuse approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms. For example, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, as a condition of approval or following approval. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a medicine and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools. 
 
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed or may include contraindications, warnings or precautions in the product labeling, including a boxed warning. If the FDA requires a boxed warning, the sponsor may also be subject to specified promotional restrictions, such as the prohibition of reminder advertisements. The FDA also may not approve the inclusion of labeling claims necessary for successful marketing. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 post-marketing studies to monitor the effect of approved products and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
 
Post-approval Requirements
 
Any products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including manufacturing, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising, promotion, drug shortage reporting, compliance with any post-approval requirements imposed as a conditional of approval such as Phase 4 clinical trials, REMS and surveillance, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, including adverse experiences.
 
After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual human prescription drug program fee requirements for approved products. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and to list their drug products and are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMPs and other requirements, which impose procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements.
 
Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented, or FDA notification. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMPs and specifications and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 
Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in withdrawal of marketing approval, mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information or other limitations, imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program, among other consequences.
 
The FDA closely regulates the marketing and promotion of drugs. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA. Physicians, in their independent professional medical judgment, may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA-approved labelling.
 
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products, including samples, is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. The Drug Supply Chain Security Act also imposes obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products related to product tracking and tracing.
 
Failure to comply with any of the FDA’s requirements could result in significant adverse enforcement actions. These include a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold or termination of clinical trials, warning letters, untitled letters, modification of promotional materials or labeling, product recalls, product seizures or detentions, refusal to allow imports or exports, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, debarment, injunctions, fines, consent decrees, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, refusals of government contracts and new orders under existing contracts, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties, including fines and individual imprisonment. Any of these sanctions could result in adverse publicity, among other adverse consequences.

Orphan drug designation and exclusivity
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or a patient population greater than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug in the U.S. will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
 
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular active ingredient for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA, to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.
 
A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or, as noted above, if a second applicant demonstrates that its product is clinically superior to the approved product with orphan exclusivity or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
 
Hatch-Waxman Act
 
Section 505 of the FFDCA describes three types of marketing applications that may be submitted to the FDA to request marketing authorization for a new drug. A Section 505(b)(1) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy. A 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. This regulatory pathway enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s prior findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. The FDA may also require 505(b)(2) applicants to perform additional studies or measurements to support any changes from the reference listed drug. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the labeled indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant. Section 505(j) establishes an abbreviated approval process for a generic version of approved drug products through the submission of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a generic drug product that has the same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, performance characteristics and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved product. ANDAs are termed “abbreviated” because they are generally not required to include preclinical and clinical data to establish safety and efficacy. Instead, generic applicants must scientifically demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent to, or performs in the same manner as, the innovator drug through in vitro, in vivo, or other testing. The generic version must deliver the same amount of active ingredients into a subject’s bloodstream in the same amount of time as the innovator drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the reference listed drug.
 
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA patents whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. These products may be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA.
 
Any applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug or method of use that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a Paragraph IV certification. Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except where the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed patent through a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or does not indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all of the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, or, if permissible, are carved out.
 
If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the holder of the NDA for the reference listed drug and the patent owner once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA holder or patent owner may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification prevents the FDA from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the date of the lawsuit, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. This prohibition is generally referred to as the 30-month stay. In instances where an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant files a Paragraph IV certification, the NDA holder or patent owner regularly take action to trigger the 30-month stay, recognizing that the related patent litigation may take many months or years to resolve. Thus, approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA could be delayed for a significant period of time depending on the patent certification the applicant makes and the reference drug sponsor’s decision to initiate patent litigation. The applicant may also elect to submit a statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain, or carves out, any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent.
 
    18 

  

The FDA provides periods of regulatory exclusivity, which provides the holder of an approved NDA limited protection from new competition in the marketplace for the innovation represented by its approved drug for a period of three or five years following the FDA’s approval of the NDA. Five years of exclusivity are available to new chemical entities, or NCEs. An NCE is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion, excluding those appended portions of the molecule that cause the drug to be an ester, salt, including a salt with hydrogen or coordination bonds, or other noncovalent derivatives, such as a complex, chelate, or clathrate, of the molecule, responsible for the therapeutic activity of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review or approve an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that contains the previously approved active moiety. An ANDA or 505(b)(2) application, however, may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. Applicants may also seek to carve out certain drug labeling that is protected by exclusivity.
 
If a product is not eligible for the NCE exclusivity, it may be eligible for three years of exclusivity. Three-year exclusivity is available to the holder of an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical trials, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence trials, was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted or sponsored by the applicant. This three-year exclusivity period protects against FDA approval of ANDAs and 505(b)(2) NDAs for the condition of the new drug’s approval. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and efficacy.
 
DEA Regulation
 
Our products and certain of our product candidates are, or if approved, will be regulated as “controlled substances” as defined in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA, and the DEA’s implementing regulations, which establish registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution, importation, exportation, inventory, quota and other requirements administered by the DEA. These requirements are directly applicable to us and also applicable to our contract manufacturers and to distributors, prescribers and dispensers of our product candidates. The DEA regulates the handling of controlled substances through a closed chain of distribution. This control extends to the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce.
 
The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have no established medicinal use and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. Schedule II drugs are those that meet the following criteria:
 

● | the drug has a high potential for abuse; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the drug has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States or a currently accepted medical use with severe restrictions; and
● | abuse of the drug may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence. 

 
APADAZ and AZSTARYS are listed as Schedule II controlled substances under the CSA. For Schedule II controlled substances, the importation of APIs for our product candidates, as well as the manufacture, shipping, storage, sales and use of the products, are subject to a high degree of regulation. In addition to maintaining an importer and/or exporter registration, importers and exporters of controlled substances must obtain a permit for every import of a Schedule I or II substance and a narcotic substance in Schedule III, IV and V, as well as every export of a Schedule I or II substance and a narcotic substance in Schedule III and IV. For all other drugs in Schedule III, IV and V, importers and exporters must submit an import or export declaration. Schedule II drugs are subject to the strictest requirements for registration, security, recordkeeping and reporting. Also, distribution and dispensing of these drugs are highly regulated. For example, all Schedule II drug prescriptions must be signed by a physician, physically presented to a pharmacist and may not be refilled without a new prescription. Electronic prescriptions may also be permissible depending on the state, so long as the prescription complies with the DEA’s requirements for electronic prescriptions.
 
SDX, which is the sole API in KP1077 and KP879, has been listed as a Schedule IV controlled substance under the CSA. Controlled substances classified in Schedule III, IV, and V are also subject to registration, recordkeeping, reporting, and security requirements. For example, Schedule III drug prescriptions must be authorized by a physician and may not be refilled more than six months after the date of the original prescription or more than five times. A prescription for controlled substances classified in Schedules III, IV, and V issued by a physician, may be communicated either orally, in writing or by facsimile to the pharmacies. Controlled substances that are also classified as narcotics, such as hydrocodone, oxycodone and hydromorphone, are also subject to additional DEA requirements, such as manufacturer reporting of the import of narcotic raw material.
 
Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized. Similarly, separate registrations are also required for separate facilities. Acquisition and distribution transactions must also be reported for Schedule I and II controlled substances, as well as Schedule III narcotic substances.
 
The DEA typically inspects a facility to review its security measures prior to issuing a registration and on a periodic basis. Security requirements vary by controlled substance schedule, with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures include background checks on employees and physical control of inventory through measures such as cages, surveillance cameras and inventory reconciliations. Records must be maintained for the handling of all controlled substances, and periodic reports made to the DEA, for example distribution reports for Schedule I and II controlled substances, Schedule III substances that are narcotics, and other designated substances. Reports must also be made for thefts or losses of any controlled substance, and to obtain authorization to destroy any controlled substance. In addition, special permits and notification requirements apply to imports and exports of narcotic drugs. To enforce these requirements, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in loss or diversion, can result in administrative, civil or criminal enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate administrative proceedings to revoke those registrations. In some circumstances, violations could result in criminal proceedings.
 


    19 

  

In addition, a DEA quota system controls and limits the availability and production of controlled substances in Schedule I or II. Distributions of any Schedule I or II controlled substance or Schedule III narcotic must also be accompanied by special order forms, with copies provided to the DEA. Because AZSTARYS, APADAZ and our product candidates may be regulated as Schedule II controlled substances, they may be subject to the DEA’s production and procurement quota scheme. The DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for how much of a controlled substance may be produced in total in the United States based on the DEA’s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate scientific and medicinal needs. The limited aggregate amount of stimulants that the DEA allows to be produced in the United States each year is allocated among individual companies, which must submit applications annually to the DEA for individual production and procurement quotas. We and our contract manufacturers must receive an annual quota from the DEA in order to produce or procure any Schedule I or Schedule II substances for use in manufacturing of our product candidates. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. Our, or our contract manufacturers’, quota of an active ingredient may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical trials. Any delay, limitation or refusal by the DEA in establishing our, or our contract manufacturers’, quota for controlled substances could delay or stop our clinical trials or product launches, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
 
Individual states also independently regulate controlled substances. We and our contract manufacturers will be subject to state regulation on distribution of these products, including, for example, state requirements for licensures or registration.
 
Other Healthcare Regulatory Frameworks
 
Our business activities, including but not limited to, research, sales, promotion, distribution, medical education and other activities are subject to regulation by numerous regulatory and law enforcement authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including potentially the Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and its various divisions, including the CMS and the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense and state and local governments. Our business activities must comply with numerous healthcare laws, including those described below. Compliance with government regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, the referral of an individual for, or purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of, any good, facility, item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Additionally, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, or the specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation.
 
The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal False Claims Act, which can be enforced by private citizens through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. In addition, a claim for payment of items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.
 
The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of whether the payor is public or private, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a health care benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a health care offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute, or the specific intent to violate it, to have committed a violation.
 
Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act and its implementing regulations, require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with specified exceptions) to report annually information related to specified payments or other transfers of value provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain other healthcare providers (physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, anesthesiologist assistants, and certified nurse-midwives) and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, such providers and teaching hospitals and to report annually specified ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
 
Depending on the circumstances, failure to comply with these laws can result in significant penalties, including criminal, civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, debarment from government contracts, individual imprisonment, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, exclusion from government programs, refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our business.

Data Privacy and Security Laws
 
We may be subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and standards by foreign, federal, state and local governments that govern the collection, use, access to, confidentiality and security of health-related and other personal information. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws and consumer protection laws and regulations govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. In addition, certain foreign laws govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health-related data. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
Healthcare Reform Measures
 
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals designed to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
 
For example, in March 2010, the ACA was passed, which has substantially changed health care financing by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly affected the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things, subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for specified branded prescription drugs, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, expanded health care fraud and abuse laws, revised the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers to the state and federal government for covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated, imposed an inflation penalty on new formulations of drugs, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, expanded the 340B program which caps the price at which manufacturers can sell covered outpatient pharmaceuticals to specified hospitals, clinics and community health centers, and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research.
 
Since its enactment there have been executive, judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA.  Prior to the Supreme Court's decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021, through August 15, 2021, for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA.
 
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers, which went into effect in April 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2032 with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020, through March 31, 2022, unless additional Congressional action is taken. In addition, in January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several categories of healthcare providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. On March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 was signed into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, beginning January 1, 2024.
 
Further, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, was signed into law. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare (beginning in 2026), imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023), and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025). The IRA permits the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. For that and other reasons, it is currently unclear how the IRA will be effectuated. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. It is also possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare product candidates and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressures.

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the companies to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the companies, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
Foreign Regulation
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to develop or sell any products outside of the United States. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2022, we employed 36 employees, 32 of which were full-time employees.
 
Corporate Information
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Iowa in October 2006 and were reincorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in May 2014. We changed our name from KemPharm, Inc. to Zevra Therapeutics, Inc. effective as of February 21, 2023.
