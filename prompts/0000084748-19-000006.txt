Growth Strategy and Recent Acquisitions
Our growth strategy is based upon the following principles: (1) market-driven organization, (2) innovation leadership, (3) synergistic mergers and acquisitions, and (4) operational excellence. As a market-driven organization, we are focused on growth drivers, including advanced mobility and advanced connectivity. More specifically, the key trends currently affecting our business include the increasing use of advanced driver assistance systems and adoption of electric and hybrid electric vehicles in the automotive industry and new technology adoption in the telecommunications industry, including next generation wireless infrastructure. In addition to our focus on advanced mobility and advanced connectivity in the automotive and telecommunications industries, we sell into a variety of other end markets including renewable energy, consumer electronics, aerospace and defense and diverse general industrial applications.
Our sales and marketing approach is based on addressing these trends, while our strategy focuses on factors for success as a manufacturer of engineered materials and components: quality, service, cost, efficiency, innovation and technology. We have expanded our capabilities through organic investment and acquisitions, and we strive to ensure high quality solutions for our customers. We continue to review and re-align our manufacturing and engineering footprint in an effort to attain a leading competitive position globally. We have established or expanded our capabilities in various locations in support of our customers’ growth initiatives.
We seek to enhance our operational and financial performance by investing in research and development, manufacturing and materials efficiencies, and new product initiatives that respond to the needs of our customers. We strive to evaluate operational and strategic alternatives to improve our business structure and align our business with the changing needs of our customers and major industry trends affecting our business.
In executing on our growth strategy, we have completed three strategic acquisitions in the last three fiscal years: (1) in July 2018, we acquired Griswold LLC (Griswold), a manufacturer of a wide range of high-performance engineered cellular elastomer and microcellular polyurethane products and solutions, (2) in January 2017, we acquired the principal operating assets of Diversified Silicone Products, Inc. (DSP), a custom silicone product development and manufacturing business serving a wide range of high reliability applications, and (3) in November 2016, we acquired DeWAL Industries LLC (DeWAL), a manufacturer of polytetrafluoroethylene and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene films, pressure sensitive tapes and specialty products for the industrial, aerospace, automotive and electronics markets. Additionally, in August 2018, we acquired a production facility and related machinery and equipment located in Chandler, Arizona from Isola USA Corp (Isola).
Operating Segments
Advanced Connectivity Solutions
Our ACS operating segment designs, develops, manufactures and sells circuit materials and solutions enabling high-performance and high-reliability connectivity for applications in wireless infrastructure (e.g., power amplifiers, antennas, small cells and distributed antenna systems), automotive (e.g., active safety, advanced driver assistance systems, telematics and thermal management), aerospace and defense, connected devices (e.g., mobile internet devices and Internet of Things), wired infrastructure (e.g., computing and IP infrastructure) and consumer electronics. We believe these products have characteristics that offer performance and other functional advantages in many market applications that serve to differentiate our products from other commonly available materials. These products are sold principally to independent and captive printed circuit board fabricators that convert our laminates to custom printed circuits. Trade names for our ACS products include: RO3000®, RO4000®, RT/duroid®, TMM®, AD SeriesTM and CLTE SeriesTM. As of December 31, 2018, our ACS operating segment had manufacturing and administrative facilities in Chandler, Arizona; Rogers, Connecticut; Bear, Delaware; Evergem, Belgium; and Suzhou, China.
Elastomeric Material Solutions
Our EMS operating segment designs, develops, manufactures and sells engineered material solutions for a wide variety of applications and end markets. These include polyurethane and silicone materials used in critical cushioning, sealing and vibration management applications for portable electronics (e.g., smart phones), automotive, aerospace, rail, footwear and printing end markets; customized silicones used in flex heater and semiconductor thermal applications; polytetrafluoroethylene and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene materials used in wire and cable, pressure-sensitive tapes and automotive applications. We believe these materials have characteristics that offer functional advantages in many market applications which serve to differentiate Rogers’ products from other commonly available materials. EMS products are sold globally to converters, fabricators, distributors and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Trade names for our EMS products include: PORON®, BISCO®, DeWAL®, ARLON®, DSP®, Griswold®, eSORBA®, XRD®, HeatSORB™ and R/bak®.
As of December 31, 2018, our EMS operating segment had administrative and manufacturing facilities in Moosup, Connecticut; Rogers, Connecticut; Woodstock, Connecticut; Bear, Delaware; Carol Stream, Illinois; Narragansett, Rhode Island; Santa Fe Springs, California; Ansan, South Korea; and Suzhou, China. We also own 50% of: (1) Rogers Inoac Corporation (RIC), a joint venture established in Japan to design, develop, manufacture and sell PORON products predominantly for the Japanese market and (2) Rogers INOAC Suzhou Corporation (RIS), a joint venture established in China to design, develop, manufacture and sell PORON products primarily for RIC customers in various Asian countries. INOAC Corporation owns the remaining 50% of both

RIC and RIS. RIC has manufacturing facilities at the INOAC facilities in Nagoya and Mie, Japan, and RIS has manufacturing facilities at Rogers’ facilities in Suzhou, China.
Power Electronics Solutions
Our PES operating segment designs, develops, manufactures and sells ceramic substrate materials for power module applications (e.g., variable frequency drives, vehicle electrification and renewable energy), laminated busbars for power inverter and high power interconnect applications (e.g., mass transit, hybrid-electric and electric vehicles, renewable energy and variable frequency drives) and micro-channel coolers (e.g., laser cutting equipment). We sell our ceramic substrate materials and micro-channel coolers under the curamik® trade name, and our busbars under the ROLINX® trade name. As of December 31, 2018, our PES operating segment had manufacturing and administrative facilities in Evergem, Belgium; Eschenbach, Germany; Budapest, Hungary; and Suzhou, China.
Other
Our Other operating segment consists of elastomer components for applications in ground transportation, office equipment, consumer and other markets; elastomer floats for level sensing in fuel tanks, motors, and storage tanks; and inverters for portable communications and automotive markets. Trade names for our elastomer components include: NITROPHYL® floats for level sensing in fuel tanks, motors, and storage tanks and ENDUR® elastomer rollers.
Sales and Competition
We sell our materials and components primarily through direct sales channels positioned near major concentrations of our customers in North America, Europe and Asia. We sold to over 5,000 customers worldwide in 2018, primarily OEMs and component suppliers. No individual customer represented more than 10% of our total net sales for 2018; however, there are concentrations of OEM customers in our ACS (Chinese telecommunications equipment manufacturers) and PES (semiconductor and automotive manufacturers) operating segments. Although the loss of any one of our larger customers would require a period of adjustment, during which the results of operations could be materially adversely impacted, we believe that such events could be successfully mitigated over a period of time due to the diversity of our customer base.
We employ a technical sales and marketing approach pursuant to which we work collaboratively to provide design engineering, testing, product development and other technical support services to OEMs that incorporate our engineered materials and components in their products. Component suppliers convert, modify or otherwise incorporate our engineered materials and components into their components for these OEMs in accordance with their specifications. Accordingly, we provide similar technical support services to component suppliers.
We compete primarily with manufacturers of high-end materials, some of which are large, multi-national companies, principally on the basis of innovation, historical customer relationships, product quality, reliability, performance and price, technical and engineering service and support, breadth of product line, and manufacturing capabilities. We also compete with manufacturers of commodity materials, including smaller regional producers with lower overhead costs and profit requirements located in Asia that attempt to upsell their products based principally upon price, particularly for products that have matured in their life cycle. We believe that we have a competitive advantage because of our reputation for innovation, the quality and reliability of our materials and components, and our commitment to technical support and customer service.
Research and Development
We have a history of innovation, and innovation leadership is a key component of our overall business strategy. The markets we serve are typically characterized by rapid technological changes and advances. Accordingly, the success of our strategy is in part dependent on our ability to develop market-leading products, which is primarily driven by efforts in research and development. We are focused on identifying technologies and innovations related to both our current product portfolio as well as initiatives targeted at further diversifying and growing our business. As part of this technology commitment, we have Rogers Innovation Centers at Northeastern University in Burlington, Massachusetts, as well as at our facilities in Chandler, Arizona, Eschenbach, Germany and Suzhou, China. Our Innovation Centers focus on early stages of technical and commercial development of new high-tech materials solutions in an effort to align with market direction and needs.
Patents and Other Intellectual Property
We have many domestic and foreign patents, licenses and have additional patent applications pending related to technology in each of our operating segments. These patents and licenses vary in duration and provide some protection from competition. We also own a number of registered and unregistered trademarks and have acquired and developed certain confidential and proprietary technology, including trade secrets that we believe to be of some importance to our business.
While we believe our patents and other intellectual property provide a competitive advantage to our operating segments, we believe that a significant part of our competitive position and future success will be determined by factors such as the innovative skills, systems and process knowledge, and technological expertise of our personnel; the range of new products we develop; and our customer service and support.

Manufacturing and Raw Materials
The key raw materials used in our business are as follows: for our ACS operating segment, copper, polymer and polytetraflouroethylene materials; for our EMS operating segment, polyurethane, polytetraflouroethylene, polyethylene, silicone and natural rubber materials; and for our PES operating segment, copper, ceramic and brazing paste materials.
Some of the raw materials used in our business are available through sole or limited-source suppliers. While we have undertaken strategies to mitigate the risks associated with sole or limited source suppliers, these strategies may not be effective in all cases, and price increases or disruptions in our supply of raw materials could have a material adverse impact on our business. For additional information, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Seasonality
Except for some minor seasonality for consumer products, which often aligns with year-end holidays and product launch cycles, the operations of our segments have not been seasonal.
Our Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 3,700 people.
Backlog
Our backlog of firm orders was $152.8 million as of December 31, 2018, compared to $122.8 million as of December 31, 2017. The year-over-year increase in backlog was mainly comprised of a $24.1 million increase in the backlog for our PES operating segment, primarily due to overall sales growth in 2018 compared to 2017 and favorable foreign currency fluctuations, in addition to $4.2 million of backlog related to Griswold. The backlog of firm orders is expected to be filled within the next 12 months.
