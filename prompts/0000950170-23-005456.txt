 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Business
 We are a global, market-leading business services provider of safety and specialty services in over 500 locations worldwide. We provide statutorily mandated and other contracted services to a strong base of long-standing customers across industries. We have a winning leadership culture driven by entrepreneurial business leaders that deliver innovative solutions to our customers.


We believe that our core strategies of driving organic growth and growth through accretive acquisitions, promoting sharing of best practices across all of our businesses, and leveraging our scale and services offerings place us in the position to capitalize on opportunities and trends in the industries we serve, grow our businesses and advance our position in each of our markets. We believe that our revenue diversification across customers, end markets, geographies and projects, combined with our go-to-market strategy of selling inspection work first, regional approach to operating our businesses, specialty operations in niche markets, strong commitment to leadership development, long-standing customers with a robust reputation in the industries we serve, and strong safety track record differentiates us from our competitors.
 We have a disciplined acquisition platform which has historically provided strategic acquisitions that are integrated into our operations. Since 2005, we have completed more than 90 acquisitions. We target companies that align with our strategic priorities and demonstrate key value drivers such as culture, geography, end markets and client base, capabilities, and leadership. Our priorities are unified around maintaining business continuity while identifying and implementing operational efficiencies, cost synergies, and integration of organizational processes to drive margin expansion.
 We employ a regional operating model designed to improve speed and responsiveness to our customers across our businesses, empower leadership of our businesses to drive business performance and execute key decisions, and foster cross-functional sharing of best practices. This structure promotes a business-owner mindset among our individual business leaders and combines the personal attention of a small-to-medium sized company with the strength and support of an industry leader. It also allows each of our businesses to remain highly focused on best positioning itself within the categories in which it competes and reinforces strong accountability for operational and financial performance.
 We operate our business under two primary operating segments, which are also our reportable segments:
 •Safety Services – A leading provider of safety services in North America, Asia Pacific, and Europe, focusing on end-to-end integrated occupancy systems (fire protection solutions, Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (“HVAC”), and entry systems), including design, installation, inspection, and service of these integrated systems. The work performed within this segment spans across industries and facilities and includes commercial, education, healthcare, high tech, industrial, and special-hazard settings.
 •Specialty Services – A leading provider of a variety of infrastructure services and specialized industrial plant services, which include maintenance and repair of critical infrastructure such as underground electric, gas, water, sewer, and telecommunications infrastructure. Our services include engineering and design, fabrication, installation, maintenance service and repair, retrofitting and upgrading, pipeline infrastructure, access and road construction, supporting facilities, and performing ongoing integrity management and maintenance to customers within the energy industry. Customers within this segment vary from private and public utilities, communications, healthcare, education, transportation, manufacturing, industrial plants and governmental agencies throughout North America.
 Our Industry
The industries in which we operate are highly fragmented and comprised of national, regional, and local companies that provide services to customers across various end markets and geographies. We believe the following industry trends are affecting, and will continue to affect, demand for our services.
Increased Regulation. The life safety industry is highly regulated at the federal, state, and local levels and continuous regulatory changes, including mandated building codes and inspections and maintenance requirements, continue to generate increasing demand for our services, often on a recurring basis. Specifically, the Uniform Building Codes written by the National Fire Protection Association and the International Code Council regulate fire suppression and sprinkler systems. Among other things, these codes require testing, inspections, repair, maintenance and specific retrofits of building fire suppression and sprinkler systems, which generates recurring revenue related to those services. As these associations and government agencies continue to adopt new, more stringent regulations, the demand for our services increases.
Deferred Infrastructure Investment. Following several years of deferred investment, the aging United States ("U.S.") infrastructure system requires significant maintenance, repair and retrofit services which has spurred demand in our industry. State and local municipalities have deferred infrastructure spending for many years which has resulted in the need to rebuild or retrofit a large portion of the U.S. infrastructure. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act signed into law on November 15, 2021 includes $550 billion of newly authorized infrastructure spending over the next 5 years.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe that the following are our key competitive strengths:
Leading Market Positions in Diverse Set of Niche Industries. We believe that we are one of the go-to-market leaders in each of the niche industries we serve, including the industry leader in fire protection and sprinkler services, among the top five specialty contractors in North America, and a large provider of fire and security solutions in many of the international markets we serve. We believe that our revenue diversification across customers, end markets, geographies and projects, combined with our go-to-market strategy of selling inspection work first, regional approach to operating our businesses, operations in niche industries with strong cross-selling opportunities and recurring revenue potential, strong commitment to leadership development, long-standing customer relationships with a robust reputation in the industries we serve, and strong safety track record differentiates us from our competitors. As a result of our strong global brand recognition, we believe we have better access to new business opportunities, allowing us to maintain and advance our market share positions.
Repeat Revenue with Diverse Mix of Customers, End Markets, Geographies and Projects. We have repeat revenue from a diverse set of long-standing blue chip customers who are spread across a variety of end markets and geographies with low concentration. Many of our customers have high creditworthiness in a direct service relationship or contracting role, providing stable cash flows and a platform for organic growth. Service inspections are often required by legislation or insurance mandates, providing a strong recurring revenue stream. Our broad geographic footprint reaches over 500 locations throughout over 20 countries, and allows us to maintain relationships with local decision makers while also having the ability to execute multi-site services for national and international account customers.
 Differentiated Business Model Focused on Growing Service Revenue. Our go-to-market strategy in life safety is to sell inspection work first, because we estimate that every dollar sold can lead to subsequent service work. In most cases, our inspection work is covered by statutory or insurance requirements. Nearly all facilities that have existing life safety systems are required by law to have that system inspected on an annual basis. This strategy differentiates us from our peers and ultimately creates a stickier client relationship that we believe leads to recurring revenue, higher margins, and growth opportunities.
 Attractive Industry Fundamentals. We believe that the diversity of end markets we serve and the regulatory-driven demand for certain of our services will enable us to better withstand various economic cycles. We believe that the industries in which we operate are subject to increasingly complex and evolving regulatory environments and have experienced pent-up demand resulting from years of deferred maintenance and retrofit investment. We believe this presents attractive opportunities for us to drive growth in our businesses and enhance our market share positions.
Disciplined Acquisition Platform with History of Strategic Acquisitions. We have a disciplined acquisition platform through which we systematically target, execute, and integrate strategic acquisitions. Since 2005, we have completed over 90 acquisitions. Through our selective approach, we identify and assess companies that we believe align with our strategic priorities and demonstrate key value drivers such as culture, geography, end markets, client base, leadership, and service capabilities. Each of our businesses maintains its identity, reputation, customer relationships and culture following acquisition while benefiting from the resources of the APG network, which we believe is an important differentiator. Our acquired businesses benefit from direct access to the APG network, which facilitates organizational sharing of knowledge and best practices, increases collaboration across our businesses and develops cross-brand solutions which foster enhanced experience, quality, and efficiency.
 Differentiated Leadership Culture and Operating Model. We believe that one of our core pillars of success is our distinct leadership development culture predicated on Building Great Leaders®, our cross-functional leadership development platform designed to enable independent company leadership, cultivate broad management skills, enhance organizational flexibility, and empower the next cohort of leaders across our businesses. This culture of investing in leadership development at all levels of the organization has created an empowered, entrepreneurial atmosphere which facilitates organizational sharing of knowledge and best practices and enables the development of cross-brand solutions and innovation. Another important initiative is our field-based leadership programs. We believe our approach to field leadership is different from our peers’ field-based programs, which tend to focus on technical competence as opposed to leadership. Moreover, we employ a decentralized operating model which improves speed and responsiveness to customers in industries with strict requirements. This also empowers the leaders of our businesses to drive business performance and execute key decisions, while highlighting the significant focus we place on ensuring members of our team receive continuous investment in their development.

Resilient Business Model with Multiple Levers to Navigate Downturns. Our proactive approach to managing risk across our platform, recurring revenue services-focused business model, and highly variable cost structure provide significant flexibility to effectively navigate downturns. Our significant union labor force in the U.S. and subcontract labor force internationally allow us to flex our workforce capacity as market conditions dictate without incurring significant trailing costs or severance. Our average project duration is relatively short, which helps mitigate inflationary exposure to cost of goods sold or changes in labor expense that some peers may experience in an inflationary environment. Historically, we have managed inflationary pressure through cost efficiency and cost saving actions, when needed. We believe that our broad mix of customers across many sectors and strong recurring revenue streams help us mitigate the impact of economic downturns on our business. In a downturn we have multiple levers to pull to preserve cash due to a high proportion of variable costs.
 Attractive Financial Performance and Strong Margin and Cash Flow Profile. We believe that, due to our differentiated operating model, diversified services offerings, historically strong organic growth, and disciplined acquisition strategy, we have an attractive financial performance profile. In addition, we support margin growth by leveraging our scale to benefit from procurement savings resulting from enhanced purchasing power and serving higher-margin, niche industries. We also have a stable cash flow profile driven by our focus on recurring services-based revenue and our asset-light business model, which requires minimal ongoing capital expenditures (which are typically approximately 1.5% of total net revenues). The mission-critical nature of our services and regulatory-driven inspection requirements provide predictable, recurring revenue stream opportunities. Maintenance and services revenues are less cyclical, and are reasonably recurring due to the consistent renewal rates and deep customer relationships.
Our Business Strategy
We intend to continue to grow our businesses, both organically and through acquisitions, and advance our position in each of the markets we serve by pursuing the following integrated business strategies:
Drive Organic Growth. We believe that we can continue to grow our businesses organically and capture additional market share across each of our segments by focusing on growing maintenance, inspection, monitoring, and service revenue and maximizing cross-selling opportunities.
•Grow Maintenance, Inspection, and Service Revenue - We believe that we can drive substantial organic growth by focusing on growing our maintenance, inspection, and service revenue, which is a component of our business in each of our segments. We plan to capitalize on our broad base of installed projects, cross-selling opportunities, and customer relationships to continue to grow maintenance, inspection, and service revenue. 
 •Maximize Cross-Selling Opportunities - With diverse businesses, a broad reach across a variety of different industries, geographies, and end markets and a culture of collaboration, we believe that we have significant cross-selling opportunities to service more of the project life cycle and, once a project is completed, to continue to grow attractive recurring revenue streams. 
 Accelerate Growth through Acquisitions. We have a well-established acquisition platform with a track record of executing accretive acquisitions through our selective approach to targeting and assessing potential acquisitions that we believe align with our values and strategic priorities. We have a disciplined acquisition platform through which we systematically target, execute, and integrate strategic acquisitions. We believe that the markets in which we operate, which are expanding internationally, are fragmented and lend themselves to continued opportunistic acquisitions. We have grown, and plan to continue to drive growth, through accretive acquisitions, targeting businesses in our existing segments and those complementary to our service offerings.
 Continue to Foster Leadership Development throughout All Levels and Geographies of the Organization. We plan to continue to invest in and support our leadership development culture through our Building Great Leaders® platform, which we believe will continue to empower the leaders across our businesses, drive business performance and create future cross-selling opportunities. Our programmatic training and development curriculum focuses on a range of topics from enhancing technical capabilities to developing soft skills, and decision-making training to enable independent company leadership. We believe that this culture will continue to support our decentralized operating model, which combines the personal attention of a small-to-medium sized company with the strength and support of an industry leader.

Leverage Our Scale and Services Portfolio. We believe that we can grow our businesses and increase our market position by leveraging our scale and broad portfolio of services offerings to capitalize on demand for single-source national and international providers. For example, we plan to focus on expanding national and international accounts and further developing an entity-wide purchasing program to realize the benefits from volume discounts and vendor pricing. We plan to leverage our industry-leading positions and the leadership across our businesses to capture growth opportunities across each of our segments. In addition, our increasing international footprint enhances our services platform with complementary offerings and cross-selling opportunities.
Customers
We have long-standing relationships with many customers in each of the industries we serve. We serve customers in both the public and private sectors, including commercial, industrial, distribution and fulfillment centers, manufacturing, education, healthcare, telecom, utilities, transmission, high tech, entertainment, and government. Our customers range from Fortune 500 companies with diverse, worldwide operations to single-location companies. We have low customer concentration with no single customer accounting for more than 5% of our total net revenues for 2022.
Our focus on providing high quality service promotes deep, long-term relationships with our customers which often results in continued opportunities for new business and a reliable source of recurring revenue for ongoing inspection, maintenance, and monitoring services. We often provide services under master service and other service agreements, which can be multi-year agreements, subject to earlier termination. The remainder of our work is generated pursuant to contracts for specific projects or jobs that require shorter-term services.
Customers are billed with varying frequency, the timing of which is generally dependent upon advance billing terms, milestone billings based on completion of certain phases of the work, or when services are provided. Under the typical payment terms of master and other service agreements and contracts for specific projects, the customer makes progress payments based on quantifiable measures of performance as defined in the agreements. Some of our contracts include retainage provisions, under which a portion of the contract amount can be retained by the customer until final contract settlement.
 Government Regulation and Environmental Matters
Our business activities are subject to regional, national, state, and local laws and regulations in each country in which we conduct business. These laws and regulations involve matters including compliance with codes or regulations governing our services, licensing and certification requirements, environmental and substance control, workplace safety, privacy, data use, data security and protection of personal information, data storage and retention, biometrics, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, taxation, economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions, anti-corruption and political law compliance, securities law compliance, and financial services. In some cases, laws and regulations outside of the U.S. impose different obligations or are more restrictive than those in the U.S.
 These regulations are administered by various regional, national, state, and local health and safety and environmental agencies and authorities. While we cooperate with governmental authorities and take reasonable measures to meet regulatory requirements, certain of these risks are inherent in the operation of our business irrespective of regulatory compliance. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may involve civil and criminal liability. We are also subject to a wide range of reporting, licensure, certification, and compliance requirements as prescribed by various multi-national, national, state, and local governmental bodies or agencies, for example, individual or corporate licensing requirements or certifications that qualify us to perform the services we offer. We believe we have all required licenses to conduct our business activities and are in substantial compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Expenditures relating to such regulations are made in the normal course of our business and are neither material nor place us at any competitive disadvantage. We do not currently expect that compliance with such laws and regulations will require us to make material expenditures. If we fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could be subject to substantial fines or revocation of our operating licenses.
 We are subject to various national, state, and local labor and employment laws and regulations which govern minimum wage and hour requirements, overtime, working conditions, mandatory benefits, health and social insurance, statutory notice periods and other employment-related matters, duties and obligations. Additionally, a large portion of our business uses labor that is provided under collective bargaining agreements or is subject to works council processes. As such, we are subject to national and local laws and regulations related to unionized labor and collective bargaining.

We also are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that impose liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment or potential liability for harm to persons or property. Under certain of these laws and regulations, liabilities can be imposed for cleanup of properties, regardless of whether we directly caused the contamination or violated any law at the time of discharge or disposal. The presence of contamination from such substances or wastes could interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect our business. In addition, we could be held liable for significant penalties and damages under certain environmental laws and regulations. Our contracts with customers may also impose liabilities on us regarding environmental issues that arise through the performance of our services. Additionally, under some legal theories of recovery applicable to claims for personal injury or property damage, liability could be imposed in connection with allegedly hazardous substances on a market share basis, eliminating the need for claimants to prove a direct relationship between the injury and our business operations. From time to time, we may incur costs and obligations related to environmental compliance and/or remediation matters or claims related to hazardous substances.
 Effect of Seasonality and Cyclical Nature of Business
 Our net revenues and results of operations can be subject to variability stemming from seasonal and other variations. Seasonal variations can be influenced by weather conditions impacting customer spending patterns, contract award seasons, and project schedules, as well as the timing of holidays. Consequently, net revenues for our businesses are typically lower during the first and second quarters due to the prevalence of unfavorable weather conditions within our North America companies, which can cause project delays and affect productivity.
 Additionally, the industries we serve can be cyclical. Fluctuations in end-user demand, or in the supply of services within those industries, can affect demand for our services. As a result, our business may be adversely affected by industry declines or by delays in new projects. Variations or unanticipated changes in project schedules in connection with large projects can create fluctuations in net revenues.
 Competitive Environment
 We operate in industries which are highly competitive and highly fragmented. There are relatively few barriers to entry in many of the industries in which we operate, and as a result, any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise could become a competitor. In each of our segments, we compete with a number of companies, ranging from small, owner-operated businesses operating in narrow geographic regions to large companies with national and international scale who have significant financial, technical, and marketing resources.
We compete based on a variety of factors, including price, service, technical expertise and experience, quality, safety record, response time, and reputation for customer service. A portion of our revenue is derived from agreements with customers that contain fixed price or per unit terms, and price is often an important factor in the contract award process for such work. However, we believe our customers also consider a variety of other factors, including those described above, when selecting a service provider, and we believe that our technical capabilities, broad geographic reach, and skilled labor force enable us to compete against our larger competitors.
Supply
We have multiple supply sources in various markets at competitive pricing for substantially all of our raw material and installed components. The raw materials and various purchased components we use such as piping, steel, sheet metal, fire suppression/detection components, and HVAC equipment have generally been available in sufficient quantities in a timely manner. We rely on multiple third-party manufacturers as a source for pre-fabricated goods or system components. Historically we have been able to mitigate commodity cost exposure by purchasing or price locking commodities early for particular projects, as well as selectively using time or market-based escalation provisions in proposals and contracts. While we have experienced some impacts on our supply chain to date, they have only impacted longer term contracts within our business, which are not significant. We do not anticipate experiencing significant procurement challenges, as the purchases of required materials can be sourced from multiple sources; however, tariffs or other changes in international trade relations or other factors such as the impact of pandemics, could result in limited availability of or increased costs for some materials.
Sales and Marketing
Our success depends on developing and maintaining successful long-term relationships with key customers in each of the industries we serve. We intend to continue our emphasis on developing and maintaining long-term relationships with our customers by providing reliable, high-quality service in a professional manner. We believe we can continue to leverage specific technical and marketing strengths at the individual business-level to expand the services offered in each business’s market. Our culture of collaboration across our businesses provides significant cross-selling opportunities to leverage our current project base, existing relationships and professional expertise to provide additional services to our existing customers. In North America, we provide a single point of contact for customers with a regional or national portfolio of properties through our National Service Group (“NSG”) team within our Safety Services segment, which enhances our understanding of customers on a national scale and allows us to build more meaningful relationships with our customers. Through our NSG team, we are able to quickly and efficiently allocate resources to meet customer needs.
Insurance and Legal Proceedings
The primary insured risks in our operations are bodily injury, property damage and workers’ compensation injury. We are insured for workers’ compensation, employer’s liability, auto liability, general liability, employee group health insurance, property damage or loss, business interruption, cyber incidents, pollution liability, professional liability, as well as for other business risks and retain the risk for claims resulting from uninsured deductibles or retentions per-incident or occurrence. Because we have very large deductibles or retentions, the vast majority of our claims are paid by us, so as a practical matter we self-insure the great majority of these risks. Losses under all of these insurance programs are accrued based upon our estimate of the likely ultimate liability for claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported ("IBNR"), with assistance from third-party actuaries. In addition, in connection with the Chubb Acquisition, we agreed to accept the risk on certain pending claims against Chubb and certain IBNR claims. We estimated the exposure to loss presented by such claims with the assistance of third-party actuaries and negotiated an adjustment to the purchase price in connection with these anticipated costs and have made associated accruals. These insurance liabilities and liabilities for the Chubb claims are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the extent of damage, the determination of our liability, if any, in proportion to other parties and the number of incidents not reported. The accruals are based upon known facts, historical trends and industry averages using the assistance of an actuary to project the extent of these obligations, and management believes such accruals are adequate.
Human Capital Management
 Our number one value and priority is the safety, health and well-being of all of our employees. Our employees are critical to the execution of our strategies and achieving business success. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 26,000 employees, of which approximately 13,000 were represented by unions and were subject to various collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced and do not expect any significant strikes or work stoppages and believe our relations with employees covered by collective bargaining agreements are in good standing.
Talent Development and Employee Engagement
  We believe our success in attracting and retaining qualified employees will be based on the quality of our training, leadership development and opportunities for growth and advancement. We offer multiple accelerated development programs focusing on advancing the business and leadership skills of employees. Our field-based leadership has the opportunity to participate in a development program focused on building foundational leadership skills. In addition, we offer less structured tools and opportunities for development, including individual development plans, executive coaching, strategic leadership advisory services and on-demand learning opportunities hosted on our learning management platform, our intranet site and through podcasts.
We believe that a culture where every employee can grow, thrive, and feel they belong is a differentiator and enables us to attract and retain employees who also build inclusive relationships with our customers. We are committed to all dimensions of diversity including gender identity, race, sexual orientation, ability, backgrounds, and beliefs. We are building and evolving our culture of inclusion through our day-to-day work through our leadership, learning and development.
We monitor employee engagement through periodic engagement assessments and provide recommendations for follow up based on this work. Our continued success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to attract, motivate, retain and reward high-quality, skilled employees.
Health & Safety
We have a safety culture that is grounded in our commitment to zero incidents. We have established safety standards covering the risks particular to our business, deployed through specific training and monitored by country-level inspection programs. The aim of these programs is to ensure that all employees are aware of and comply with safety standards we have established and all applicable laws, regulations and other requirements in the countries and jurisdictions in which we operate. We have implemented our safety program, STEPS (Striving Toward Excellence and Professionalism in Safety), within North America which promotes safety culture awareness throughout our operations. Outside of North America, we have established a security program, SAFE (Scan, Assess, Fix, Execute) which is linked to the need for preventive actions before starting work. In addition, we have multiple programs geared towards increasing everyone’s awareness of our safety culture and to empower employees to stop work if risks are unmanageable. We are currently very focused on improving our fleet performance through defensive driver training, fleet technology, and company fleet assessments. Additionally, we participate in an annual Safety Week which includes activities designed to elevate safety awareness, and we hold an annual competition to acknowledge and reward businesses exhibiting excellence in safety. Our team of over one hundred safety professionals support the operations in each business to ensure industry safety standards are met and audits by safety professionals or certified organizations are utilized to assess the maturity of our safety management systems.
Our rate of incidents recordable under the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA") per one hundred employees per year, also known as the OSHA recordable rate, was 1.0 during 2022 and 1.3 during 2021, respectively. Our rate of 1.0 is considerably less than the most recently published OSHA rate for our industry of 2.5.
 Competitive Pay, Benefits and Total Rewards and Practices
Our total rewards philosophy is designed to align the compensation of our employees with Company financial results and individual performance, and to provide the appropriate market-competitive pay to attract, retain and incentivize employees to achieve superior performance. We offer a comprehensive, competitive portfolio of health, financial and well-being benefits aligned with market practice and legal requirements in each country in which we operate. Our benefit programs support our employees bringing their best self to work as they support their mental, physical, and financial needs and goals.
