Item 1. Business.
Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, acquiring, developing and commercializing therapeutics in the disease areas of immunology, inflammation and oncology. Our goal is to be an industry leader in each of these therapeutic areas and to enhance and extend the lives of patients suffering from such diseases. To accomplish this goal, we have assembled a deeply experienced and highly skilled group of industry veterans, scientists, clinicians and key opinion leaders from leading biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, as well as leading academic centers from around the world. Our collective immunology and translational discovery and development expertise serves as the foundation of our company. We intend to maintain a scientifically rigorous and inclusive corporate culture where employees strive to bring improved therapeutic options to patients. 
 We are pursuing product candidates with strong scientific rationale to address indications where there is both a high unmet need and an opportunity to develop best-in-class or first-in-class therapeutics. We currently have six programs: three clinical-stage product candidates and three preclinical programs. We commenced a Phase 2b clinical trial for our most advanced product candidate, GB001, in October 2018.

The following table summarizes our current programs: 
 
GB001 (DP2 Antagonist) 
 GB001 is an oral antagonist of prostaglandin D2 receptor 2, or DP2, in development for the treatment of moderate-to-severe eosinophilic asthma and other allergic conditions. Eosinophilic asthma is caused by high levels of white blood cells known as eosinophils and is associated with more severe symptoms, late-onset disease and response to steroid treatment. We estimate that approximately 50% of severe asthma patients in the United States have eosinophilic asthma. Despite the availability of new biologic therapies for these patients, asthma exacerbations remain a significant healthcare problem and an unmet medical need. As of December 31, 2018, GB001 had been studied in 409 subjects in total and was generally well tolerated. In a Phase 2 clinical trial conducted in Japan, GB001 showed a statistically significant improvement in time-to-first asthma exacerbation compared to placebo. In a separate 248-subject Phase 2 clinical trial, neither treatment group, GB001 nor montelukast, achieved the primary endpoint of improvement in forced expiratory volume in one second, or FEV1, as compared to placebo, which we believe was primarily related to study design and execution issues related to patient selection, including adherence to inhaled corticosteroid, or ICS, therapy, eosinophilic phenotype thresholds and disease severity. A single serious adverse event, intrahepatic cholestasis, a liver disorder, deemed by the investigator likely to be related to study drug was observed in a Japanese patient who had received a 160 mg dose of GB001 in a Phase 1 clinical trial conducted by Teijin Pharma Limited, or Teijin. The patient had GB001 exposure levels approximately three to five times higher than the other patients receiving the 160 mg dose, and the dose was significantly higher than the highest dose of 60 mg currently being evaluated in our ongoing Phase 2b clinical trial. We commenced a Phase 2b clinical trial in moderate-to-severe eosinophilic asthma in October 2018. 
 Furthermore, we believe that there are a number of indications along the allergic spectrum for which GB001 may provide benefit. Accordingly, we plan to pursue the parallel development of GB001 in chronic rhinosinusitis, or CRS, both with nasal polyps, or CRSwNP, and without nasal polyps and in chronic spontaneous urticaria, or CSU. We expect to initiate proof-of-concept Phase 2 clinical trials for these indications in 2019. We retain worldwide rights to GB001, excluding Japan. 
 GB002 (PDGF Receptor Kinase Inhibitor) 
 GB002 is an orally inhaled, small molecule, selective platelet-derived growth factor, or PDGF, receptor kinase inhibitor in development for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH, an orphan disease with high unmet medical need. PAH is characterized by abnormally high pressure in the blood vessels transporting blood from the right side of the heart to the lungs and is a progressive and often fatal disease. In contrast to the three classes of marketed vasodilatory therapies for PAH, GB002 has the potential to be the first treatment with disease-modifying effects. Modulation of the PDGF pathway has been shown to be therapeutically relevant in PAH. In 2013, Novartis Pharmaceutical Corporation, or Novartis, announced results from a Phase 3 clinical trial in PAH of imatinib (Gleevec), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with known activity against PDGF and marketed for oncology indications. These results were notable for not only achievement of statistically significant improvement in the study’s primary efficacy endpoint, but also for systemic toxicities. To our knowledge, no further development of the drug has occurred in PAH. To 
 4
 
date, these toxicities have not been observed with GB002 in our ongoing Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers. We plan to commence a Phase 1b clinical trial in PAH in the first half of 2019 and a Phase 2/3 clinical trial in PAH in the second half of 2019. We retain worldwide rights to GB002. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, has granted GB002 orphan drug designation for the treatment of patients with PAH. 
 GB004 (HIF-1α Stabilizer) 
 GB004 is a novel, gut-targeted, oral small molecule in development for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD, including ulcerative colitis, or UC, and Crohn’s disease, or CD. GB004 stabilizes hypoxia inducible factor-1a, or HIF-1a, through the inhibition of prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins, or PHDs, key enzymes involved in HIF degradation. Preclinical data from animal models of IBD demonstrated that HIF-1a stabilization restores intestinal epithelial barrier integrity and function and results in immunomodulatory effects that we believe are important in reducing inflammation and enhancing mucosal healing in IBD patients. We have completed a Phase 1 single-ascending-dose, or SAD, study in healthy volunteers and are dosing healthy volunteers in a Phase 1 multiple-ascending-dose, or MAD, study. We plan to pursue clinical development in both UC and CD patients and expect to initiate a Phase 1b clinical trial in UC in the first half of 2019. We also plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial in UC in the first half of 2020. We retain worldwide rights to GB004. 
Our Research Capabilities and Preclinical Programs 
 We currently have three programs in preclinical development. GB1275 is an oral small molecule, CD11b agonist in preclinical development for the treatment of oncology indications for which we plan to submit an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application with the FDA and, after acceptance, initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in 2019. We are also currently evaluating a portfolio of novel BTK inhibitors for the treatment of autoimmune indications and small molecule cancer metabolism modulators for the treatment of solid tumors. We are continuing to build our research capabilities, specifically focusing on our areas of expertise within immunology, inflammation and oncology, in order to advance new programs into the clinic, as well as to optimize our existing programs.

effective in a variety of allergic and inflammatory diseases beyond moderate-to-severe eosinophilic asthma, and we expect to initiate proof-of-concept Phase 2 clinical trials in CRS and CSU in 2019. We also plan to develop GB004 in both UC and CD.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expeditiously generate proof-of-concept data from our preclinical programs to facilitate value creation and efficient capital deployment. We view our preclinical programs as important drivers of the long-term sustainability of our company. We plan to advance our preclinical programs to generate meaningful data to determine quickly whether each warrants clinical development.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage the drug discovery, development and commercialization expertise of our world-class team. Our executive management team and key scientific leaders have successfully discovered, developed and commercialized small molecule and biologic agents at both large and small biopharmaceutical companies.

Our Product Candidates 
 GB001 (DP2 Antagonist) 
 GB001 is an oral DP2 antagonist in development for the treatment of moderate-to-severe eosinophilic asthma and other allergic conditions. As of December 31, 2018, GB001 had been studied in 409 subjects in total and was generally well tolerated. In a Phase 2 clinical trial conducted in Japan, GB001 showed a statistically significant improvement in time-to-first asthma exacerbation compared to placebo. We commenced a Phase 2b clinical trial in moderate-to-severe eosinophilic asthma in October 2018 and expect to conduct an interim analysis in the first half of 2020. If the interim analysis is positive, we plan on initiating a Phase 3 clinical trial thereafter. We have held a Type C meeting with the FDA to inform our Phase 2b and Phase 3 clinical trial design and endpoints. In addition, we plan to pursue the parallel development of GB001 in CRS and CSU by initiating proof-of-concept Phase 2 clinical trials for these indications in 2019. We retain worldwide rights to GB001, excluding Japan. 
Mechanism of Action 
 DP2, also known as CRTh2, is a receptor for prostaglandin D2, or PGD2, a lipid mediator produced mainly by mast cells. DP2 is primarily responsible for mediating the pro-inflammatory effects of PGD2, including: 
  
• | the activation of T helper 2, or Th2, cells, ILC2 cells, basophils and eosinophils;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the stimulation of type 2 cytokine production, including IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13, by Th2 cells; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the increased expression of adhesion molecules on eosinophils and basophils.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These pro-inflammatory effects contribute to airway constriction, swelling in the walls of the airways and mucous production at sites of allergic airway inflammation, all of which are hallmarks of the airway obstruction seen in asthma. The expression of DP2 is more common in patients with more severe disease, and, importantly, a significant proportion of severe asthma patients have eosinophilic inflammation.

 Aberrant Th2 cell activation and resulting type 2 cytokine production have been shown to play a prominent role in various allergic and inflammatory disorders beyond eosinophilic asthma, including CRS, CSU, eosinophilic esophagitis and atopic dermatitis. 
 DP2 antagonism has been clinically validated by Novartis’ oral DP2 antagonist, fevipiprant, in a Phase 2 clinical trial. In this trial, both the 150 mg once-daily and 75 mg twice-daily doses demonstrated statistically significant improvements in FEV1 compared to placebo in adult patients with asthma inadequately controlled with ICS. In addition, post hoc analyses of Phase 2 safety data related to asthma worsening, including exacerbations, appeared to demonstrate a reduction in the number of subjects experiencing an asthma event on fevipiprant compared to placebo. As of December 31, 2018, fevipiprant, at 150 mg once-daily and 450 mg once-daily doses, is being investigated by Novartis in six Phase 3 clinical trials in asthma patients. 
 GB001 has been shown in preclinical studies to be a selective antagonist of the DP2 receptor. GB001 binds reversibly to human DP2 with an affinity, or Ki, of 1 to 2 nanomolar, significantly greater than its affinity for the other PGD2 receptors. No significant activity was demonstrated in a standard selectivity panel of 90 other receptors and enzymes. GB001 has also shown a slow rate of disassociation from DP2, with a receptor residence time of 19.8 minutes, as measured by half-life. Additionally, in an in vitro
6
 
assay, GB001 inhibited PGD2 induced internalization of DP2. Combined with our observed human plasma half-life of 10 to 15 hours, we believe these measurements support the oral, once-daily dosing regimen of GB001. 
 Overview of Asthma 
 Asthma is a complex, chronic, highly heterogeneous inflammatory condition of the airways characterized by airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperactivity and airway inflammation. Symptoms of asthma, which can be fatal, are also called asthma exacerbations or attacks and include episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing. 
 Patients are deemed to have intermittent, mild, moderate or severe disease based on the frequency and severity of their symptoms. Asthma can also be sub-categorized by the composition of the white blood cells that are causing inflammation in and around the airway wall. We estimate that approximately 50% of severe asthma patients have a phenotype called eosinophilic asthma, which is marked by an increase of eosinophils in the mucosal sputum that coats the airways. Eosinophils are immune cells that have been shown to play a major role in inflammation and allergic response, and eosinophilic asthma is associated with more severe symptoms, late-onset disease and response to steroid treatment. 
 Overview of the Asthma Market 
 Asthma is a substantial, widespread condition afflicting more than 330 million patients worldwide and about 25 million patients in the United States. Approximately 25% and 12% of patients in the United States have moderate and severe disease, respectively, according to Datamonitor. The disease is responsible for more than $50 billion in annual direct healthcare costs in the United States and results in an estimated 420,000 and 3,500 deaths per year worldwide and in the United States, respectively. 
 Total asthma drug sales in the U.S. market were approximately $7.9 billion in 2017 and are projected to reach $13.9 billion by 2026, according to Datamonitor. Nearly $5.6 billion of the estimated $13.9 billion in sales is attributable to biologic therapies. In the future, we believe asthma market growth may be driven by increasing disease diagnosis and new biologic and small molecule agents entering the market. 
 Treatment Paradigm in Asthma 
 The treatment guidelines for asthma, depicted below for adolescents and adults in Figure 1, are a step-up paradigm. 
 Figure 1. Treatment Guidelines for Asthma 
 

LABA = long-acting beta agonist; LTRA = leukotriene receptor antagonist; SABA = short-acting beta agonist 
 The goals of the step-up treatment paradigm are to achieve long-term control of asthma symptoms, minimize the use of SABAs and maintain near-normal lung function and activity levels. Reduction in asthma exacerbations is the primary endpoint predominantly used in new product development in asthma, while surrogate endpoints for improvements in lung function are commonly used as supportive secondary endpoints. Biologics, including the recently approved IL-5 and IL-4/IL-13 antibodies, are 
 7
 
typically used only in the most refractory, severe patients. We believe this is because of their route of administration through either subcutaneous (omalizumab, mepolizumab, benralizumab and dupilumab) or intravenous (reslizumab) injection, high cost and concerns about potential adverse events. 
 While the recent introduction of biologic agents has altered the course of treatment for refractory, severe patients, the last major change in the treatment paradigm for mild or moderate asthma came with the 1998 FDA approval of Singulair (montelukast), an LTRA, which became the top controller therapy for asthma. Worldwide sales for Singulair peaked at approximately $5.5 billion in 2011, prior to the entry of generic competition. Singulair’s profile as an effective oral drug with a well-understood safety profile made it an attractive option for patients across the severity spectrum despite inferior efficacy, as measured by asthma exacerbations rate reduction, compared to that of the biologic agents. The success of Singulair highlights the unmet need and opportunity in the asthma market for safe and effective, orally-administered therapies. 
 GB001 Product Differentiation 
 We believe there is a significant market opportunity for improved and effective oral therapies in moderate-to-severe asthma with consistent safety and tolerability profiles that can be used prior to biologics. Published Phase 2 clinical trial results for fevipiprant appear to be comparable to the anti-inflammatory effects demonstrated by certain biologics in clinical studies. We believe oral options are generally preferred to biologics due to their route of administration, which leads to improved patient adherence. Furthermore, oral administration is especially important as children and adolescents are frequent sufferers of asthma. We believe GB001 as an oral agent has the potential to reduce asthma exacerbations and improve lung function, and thereby could be positioned as a pre-biologic treatment alternative. 
Clinical Development History of GB001 
 We acquired GB001 through our acquisition of Pulmagen Therapeutics (Asthma) Limited, or Pulmagen, a wholly-owned subsidiary of our AA BioPharma Inc. subsidiary, in January 2018, after its partner, Teijin, completed a positive Phase 2, proof-of-concept clinical trial in Japanese patients. We have rights outside of Japan to all of the data from the two Phase 2 clinical trials conducted by Pulmagen and Teijin described below. As of December 31, 2018, 409 subjects have received at least one dose of GB001. 
Summary of Completed Pulmagen Phase 2 Clinical Trial 
 In December 2014, Pulmagen completed a Phase 2 clinical trial of GB001, the primary objectives of which were (1) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 20 mg GB001 once daily compared to placebo and an active comparator, montelukast, over a 10-week treatment period and (2) to evaluate the effect of the co-administration of 10 mg montelukast once daily with GB001 treatment in a two-week extension. The primary endpoint was improvement in FEV1 over 10 weeks. The study enrolled 248 patients with mild to moderate asthma that were uncontrolled on low- or medium-dose ICS, randomized 1:1:1 to placebo, 20 mg GB001 once daily and 10 mg montelukast once daily. Patients were put on a standard medium-dose of ICS with and without LABA in a four-week lead-in to the study, during which they were also removed from their LABA, if applicable. 
 GB001 was generally well tolerated with a treatment emergent adverse event, or TEAE, rate similar to placebo, but the study did not meet its primary endpoint. Notably, neither the active comparator, montelukast, nor GB001, showed statistically significant differences in FEV1 improvement as compared to placebo. We believe the lack of statistically significant differences between the active treatment arms and placebo was primarily related to study design and execution issues related to patient selection, including adherence to ICS therapy, eosinophilic phenotype thresholds and disease severity. 
Summary of Completed Teijin Phase 2 Clinical Trial 
 In December 2016, Pulmagen and Teijin announced results from a Phase 2 clinical trial of GB001 conducted by Teijin in Japan. The trial was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center study, enrolling 158 patients with mild to moderate asthma who were using LABA and/or medium-dose ICS to control their disease. Patients on LABA discontinued its use upon entry to the trial, and all patients were brought to a standardized medium dose of ICS for a four-week lead-in period. Patients were then randomized 1:1:1 to one of two dose arms of GB001, 5 mg or 20 mg once daily, or to placebo in combination with a low dose of ICS for four weeks. Following this period of combination with low-dose ICS, use of ICS was discontinued, and patients continued taking GB001 or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint of the trial was change in morning peak expiratory flow, or AM PEF, a measure of lung function, from baseline to the last visit, marked as study completion or termination from the trial. 
 A total of 91 patients completed the trial, with a higher rate of patient withdrawal due to asthma worsening in the placebo arm (62%), as compared to the GB001 arms (40%, 5 mg; 25%, 20 mg). Trial protocol required withdrawal from the protocol after meeting the criteria for asthma worsening, a key secondary endpoint, including experiencing an asthma exacerbation. A statistically significant 
 8
 
difference was seen in the AM PEF between placebo and both arms of GB001 (p = 0.015, 5 mg; p = 0.027, 20 mg). The p-value is the probability that the difference between two data sets was due to chance. The smaller the p-value, the more likely the differences are not due to chance alone. In general, if the p-value is less than or equal to 0.05, the outcome is considered statistically significant. The FDA’s evidentiary standard of efficacy generally relies on a p-value of less than or equal to 0.05. In addition, time-to-first asthma worsening reached statistical significance for the 20 mg dose arm versus placebo (p < 0.001). Asthma worsening in this trial was defined as a composite measure to help characterize overall uncontrolled asthma, including exacerbations. Figure 2 below presents the improvement in time-to-first asthma worsening of patients as measured by the asthma worsening rate. 
Figure 2. Improvement in Time-To-First Asthma Worsening of Patients with Mild to Moderate Asthma 
  
The dose response in the time-to-first exacerbation was even more pronounced in the subgroup of patients with high blood eosinophils, defined as those with greater than 300 cells per microliter (µL), as shown below in Figure 3. 
Figure 3. Pronounced Improvement in Time-To-First Asthma Worsening of Patients with High Blood Eosinophils 
 

Subgroup analyses demonstrated patients with high blood eosinophils at baseline treated with the 20 mg dose of GB001 also had statistically significant improvement in FEV1 compared with placebo (p = 0.016). GB001 was well tolerated in this trial, with an adverse event profile consistent with placebo, including nasopharyngitis, gastrointestinal disorders and measures of blood and liver markers. No serious adverse events, or SAEs, were observed in the GB001 treatment arms. 
 These results showed a clear, dose-dependent response to treatment with GB001, both in measures of lung function and in reduction of asthma worsening.

Summary of Pulmagen and Teijin Phase 1 Clinical Trials 
 In Phase 1 studies conducted by Pulmagen and Teijin, GB001 demonstrated safety and pharmacodynamic, or PD, parameters consistent with the DP2 drug class. 
 Most TEAEs were mild or moderate and were considered not related to study drug. A single SAE deemed by the investigator likely to be related to study drug was observed in a Japanese patient who had received a 160 mg dose of GB001, which is eight times higher than the highest dose Teijin tested in its Phase 2 clinical trial conducted in Japan. The patient experienced intrahepatic cholestasis, which resolved after treatment discontinuation. At the time of the intrahepatic cholestasis, the patient had GB001 exposure levels approximately three to five times higher than other patients receiving the 160 mg dose. Other than this SAE, there were no laboratory testing, physical exam or electrocardiographic findings that were considered to be clinically significant and related to GB001. 
Ongoing Phase 2b Eosinophilic Asthma Clinical Trial 
 We commenced a Phase 2b clinical trial of GB001 in moderate-to-severe eosinophilic asthma in October 2018, and we expect to conduct an interim analysis of the results of this trial in the first half of 2020. We have designed this trial to efficiently assess proof-of-principle and help enable rapid transition to Phase 3 clinical trials, and we have held a Type C meeting with the FDA to inform our trial design and endpoints. We plan to enroll 480 patients in the study in a 1:1:1:1 randomized fashion to three GB001 dose arms of 20 mg, 40 mg and 60 mg per day and one placebo arm with once-daily dosing. 
 We believe that we have designed our trial in a manner to address the potential shortcomings of the Pulmagen Phase 2 clinical trial, in that: 
  
• | the study population will consist of more severe patients than those enrolled in the Pulmagen Phase 2 clinical trial;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | enrollment inclusion criteria will be based on a history of asthma exacerbations within the last year;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | enrolled patients will be required to have moderate-to-severe asthma with eosinophil counts greater than or equal to 250 cells/µL; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | enrolled patients will be closely monitored during the run-in period to help ensure that lack of adherence to background therapy is not a contributing factor for their poorly controlled asthma.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The primary endpoint is reduction in asthma worsening from baseline, assessed at week 24, with an additional four weeks of follow-up. The parameters included in the asthma worsening composite primary endpoint include changes in FEV1, AM PEF, rescue medication use and asthma control, and severe asthma exacerbations. We will also assess FEV1 independently as a secondary efficacy measure. 
 We plan to conduct an interim analysis after approximately 320 patients complete the 24-week treatment period, and we expect the results of this interim analysis to be available in the first half of 2020. If the results obtained in the interim analysis support further development, we plan on initiating our first Phase 3 clinical trial thereafter. We expect to report full data from the Phase 2b clinical trial in the second half of 2020. If the full data support further development, we will initiate a second Phase 3 clinical trial. 
 Clinical Development Plan in Additional Indications 
 Because DP2 plays a central role in the activation of basophils, eosinophils and Th2 cells, we believe GB001 could be effective in the treatment of other Th2-associated allergic and inflammatory disorders, such as CRS, CSU, eosinophilic esophagitis and atopic dermatitis. Based on unmet medical need and a review of the mechanistic rationale and market opportunities, we have decided to initially pursue further development in CRS and CSU in parallel with our eosinophilic asthma program. 
Chronic Rhinosinusitis 
 CRS is a debilitating disorder marked by persistent symptoms including congestion, stuffiness, nasal discharge, pain or facial pressure, impairment or loss of the sense of smell (anosmia), cough and fatigue. Mast cells and eosinophils are involved in allergic forms of chronic nasal inflammation, including CRS. Nasal polyps are a type 2 cytokine driven inflammatory process, and in Caucasians, eosinophils are the predominant inflammatory cell. 
 CRS is associated with an increased risk for late-onset asthma, suggesting significant overlap in the underlying pathology of the diseases. PGD2 has been correlated with the recruitment and activation of Th2 cells in nasal polyps, and type 2 cytokines, such as 
 10
 
IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13, have been shown to play a pivotal role in nasal polyp formation. Importantly, emerging data suggest that nasal polyp status alone can often be inadequate for defining a type 2 phenotype. Tissue concentrations of IL-5 have extensive overlap in patients with and without nasal polyps. Among others, clinical studies of anti-IL-5 and anti-IL-4 receptor antibodies and an anti-immunoglobulin E, or anti-IgE, antibody are currently being studied in CRSwNP by other biopharmaceutical companies. 
 According to a 2014 study, annual direct costs related to CRS were estimated to be $6.9 to $9.9 billion worldwide. The prevalence of CRS is estimated to be 4% of the U.S. population, or approximately 13 million individuals. CRSwNP patients represent 25 to 30% of total CRS patients. CRSwNP patients are initially treated with intranasal corticosteroids. When patients fail intranasal corticosteroids, oral corticosteroids typically serve as the next line of therapy, although this treatment provides only two to four weeks of benefit while causing systemic side effects such as reduced glucose tolerance, osteoporosis and weight gain. Failure to control symptoms with corticosteroids presents the need for potential surgical intervention. A long-term study of post-surgical patients showed that nearly 80% of patients had polyps recur at least once, and 36% of patients required an additional surgery. We believe a significant number of patients in the United States are inadequately controlled with standard-of-care steroid treatment. 
 
We plan to commence a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial in adult patients with CRS in 2019 and expect data to read out in 2020. 
 Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria 
 Chronic urticaria, or CU, is characterized by the recurring eruption of transient, itchy, red welts on the skin. Patients with CU are often severely impaired in their quality of life, including negative effects on sleep, daily activities, school/work life and social interactions. Urticaria symptoms are caused by degranulation of dermal mast cells, and an allergic-mediated response is believed to contribute to mast cell activation in many cases. One of the most common forms of CU is CSU, previously known as the idiopathic form, or chronic idiopathic urticaria. In CSU patients, an underlying trigger for the skin lesions cannot be identified, thus making it impractical to employ a therapeutic strategy that relies on avoidance of causative environmental exposures. A published estimate of the U.S. prevalence of CSU ranged from 0.5% to 1.0% of the population, and approximately 20% of patients, or approximately 300,000 to 600,000 patients, have symptoms for more than five years. 
 The current treatment guidelines for the management of all forms of urticaria recommend the use of non-sedating oral H1-antihistamines as first-line therapy. For patients that do not respond to standard doses of H1-antihistamines, doses are increased by as much as four times. Though this can increase the response rates, side effects may also increase. Patients that do not respond to or are unable to tolerate high dose antihistamines have few remaining options. For antihistamine refractory patients with CSU, the only currently approved treatment is the biologic agent, omalizumab. 
 We plan to commence a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial in adult patients with CSU in 2019 and expect data to read out in 2020. 
 GB002 (PDGF Receptor Kinase Inhibitor) 
 GB002 is an orally inhaled, small molecule, PDGF receptor kinase inhibitor in development for the treatment of PAH. In contrast to the three classes of marketed vasodilatory therapies for PAH, GB002 has the potential to be the first treatment with disease-modifying effects. Inhaled GB002, which is designed to act on both isoforms of the PDGF receptor, a and b, has inhibited and reversed cell overgrowth in lung blood vessels in PAH animal models. In 2013, results from a Phase 3 clinical trial in PAH of imatinib (Gleevec), an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor with known activity against PDGF and marketed for oncology indications, showed statistically significant improvement in its primary efficacy endpoint, thus providing mechanistic validation, however systemic toxicities were also observed. To date, these toxicities have not been observed with GB002 in our ongoing Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers. We have received FDA feedback through Type C meeting interactions to inform our Phase 2/3 clinical trial design and endpoints. We plan to commence a Phase 1b clinical trial in PAH in the first half of 2019 and a Phase 2/3 clinical trial in PAH in the second half of 2019. We in-licensed GB002 from Pulmokine, Inc. in 2017 and retain worldwide rights. The FDA has granted GB002 orphan drug designation for the treatment of patients with PAH. 
Mechanism of Action 
 PAH is driven by abnormal cellular proliferation within and around the small blood vessels of the lung that carry blood from the right side of the heart to the lungs. Functional and structural changes in the pulmonary vasculature, known as vascular remodeling, can lead to smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration from the middle layer of the blood vessel into the inner layer. This can result in the development of plexiform and neointimal lesions that can obstruct blood flow. The obstruction of blood flow in the pulmonary vessels can also predispose patients to thrombosis, or blood clots, within these small pulmonary vessels that further blocks blood flow. This progressive obstruction of blood flow from the right side of the heart to the lungs can cause the right ventricle to fail, thus leading to severe breathlessness, reduced exercise tolerance and death.

The PDGF receptor is a tyrosine kinase receptor which, when activated by its agonist, induces cellular proliferation. PDGF expression is known to be particularly important to stimulating smooth muscle cell proliferation in PAH patients. Further supporting this mechanism, PDGF receptors and their ligands are both upregulated in PAH. Upregulated PDGF signaling results in endothelial cell and fibroblast dysfunction and the proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells. This effect results in the overgrowth and occlusion of blood vessels in the lung. Kinase inhibitors with activity against the PDGF pathway have shown the ability to reverse PAH in animal models. 
 Inhaled GB002 is designed to act on both isoforms of the PDGF receptor, a and b. Data from preclinical animal models and human lung histology from PAH patients suggests that it is important to inhibit both of these isoforms of the PDGF receptor. PDGF receptor a is highly expressed in pulmonary arteriole vascular smooth muscle cells, or PAVSMCs. Inhibiting PDGF receptor a may help reduce the abnormal cell proliferation of PAVSMCs that results in blood vessel thickening. PDGF receptor b is more highly expressed in fibroblasts and myofibroblasts that are involved with the abnormal cell proliferation within the blood vessel that leads to the obstruction of the pulmonary arterioles. We believe inhibiting PDGF receptor b is therefore important in decreasing the abnormal cell proliferation of these cell types.     
 Mechanistic validation of a PDGF receptor kinase inhibitor has been observed in studies of imatinib (Gleevec), an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor with known activity against the PDGF receptor kinase, which demonstrated proof-of-concept in humans in a Phase 3 clinical trial in PAH. 
 Prior PDGF Pathway Development in PAH—The IMPRES Phase 3 Clinical Trial of Imatinib
 The IMPRES trial was a Phase 3 clinical trial conducted by Novartis of imatinib (Gleevec) in PAH. Imatinib has known activity against multiple tyrosine kinases, including the PDGF and c-KIT receptors and c-ABL. 202 patients were enrolled in the IMPRES trial, of which 41% had been treated with prostanoids, oral phosphodiesterase type 5, or PDE5, inhibitors and oral endothelin receptor agonists, or ERAs. As shown in Figure 4 below, the study met its primary endpoint, improvement in six-minute walk distance, or 6MWD, versus placebo at week 24 from baseline, with statistical significance (p = 0.002). 
 
12
 
Figure 4. Improvement in Six-Minute Walk Distance of PAH Patients Treated with Imatinib 
  
As shown in Figure 5 below, patients on imatinib also demonstrated statistically significant improvements in measures of hemodynamics, including pulmonary vascular resistance, or PVR, a standard measurement in the evaluation of patients with PAH. 
 Figure 5. Improvement in Pulmonary Vascular Resistance of PAH Patients Treated with Imatinib 
  
However, systemic adverse events such as bleeding and poor tolerability and frequent drug discontinuation led to a high drop-out rate within the active arm of the trial. Subdural hematomas occurred in eight patients who were also being administered oral anticoagulants during the study. Novartis withdrew its supplemental regulatory applications in PAH in 2013 and, to our knowledge, did not pursue further development of imatinib in the indication. 
Overview of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension 
 PAH is an orphan disease that is characterized by abnormally high blood pressure in the blood vessels carrying deoxygenated blood from the right side of the heart to the lungs, and is progressive and often fatal. Symptoms include shortness of breath at rest or with minimal exertion. Other symptoms include fatigue, chest pain, dizzy spells and fainting. The progressive nature of this disease causes the right side of the heart to work much harder and eventually weaken or fail. 
 Patients are often evaluated by functional class, which categorizes patients by their ability to carry out physical activity and symptom severity. Worsening symptoms, and thus higher numbered functional classes, are associated with higher mortality. The four functional classes established by the World Health Organization are detailed below in Table 1. 
 13
 
Table 1. PAH Functional Classes 
 
 
FunctionalClass | Description 
Class I | Patients with PAH, but without resulting limitation of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue dyspnea or fatigue, chest pain or near syncope. 
Class II | Patients with PAH resulting in slight limitation of physical activity. They are comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity causes undue dyspnea or fatigue, chest pain or near syncope. 
Class III | Patients with PAH resulting in marked limitation of physical activity. They are comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary activity causes undue dyspnea or fatigue, chest pain or near syncope. 
Class IV | Patients with PAH with inability to carry out any physical activity without symptoms. These patients manifest signs of right heart failure. Dyspnea and/or fatigue may even be present at rest. Discomfort is increased by any physical activity.

 Additionally, recent medical society guidelines have identified intermediate and high-risk categories of PAH based on several variables including signs of right heart failure, rate of symptom progression, functional class, 6MWD, maximum oxygen consumption, NTproBNP, which is a biomarker for heart failure, and measures of right heart function. 
 Despite the introduction of many new therapies over the last several years, PAH continues to have a high morbidity and mortality. Based on registry data, newly diagnosed functional class III and IV patients have 5-year survival rates of 60% and 44%, respectively, while rates for previously diagnosed patients were even lower at 57% and 27%, respectively. 
 Overview of PAH Market
Diagnosed PAH prevalence in the United States is approximately 53,000 patients, and prevalence is highest among women between the ages of 30-60. The number of diagnosed PAH patients continues to increase, and we believe this increase is likely due to enhanced awareness and diagnosis of the disease. Total PAH drug sales worldwide in 2016 were estimated at approximately $5.6 billion and are expected to exceed $6.0 billion by 2019. 
 Treatment Paradigm in PAH
Current PAH therapies consist of three classes of vasodilators: PDE5 inhibitors and guanylate cyclase stimulators, ERAs, and prostanoids. PDE5 inhibitors are often used in combination with ERAs as an early treatment strategy. In patients who fail to respond to combination therapy of an ERA and a PDE5, it is common practice to add a prostanoid. Prostanoids are also commonly used to treat patients with evidence of right heart failure. While existing treatments have led to significant improvements in time to clinical worsening and other composite endpoints in PAH patients, none directly alter the underlying disease process. The effect of vasodilation, while improving blood flow through the lungs, may eventually be overtaken by the worsening cellular proliferation and arterial remodeling underlying the condition. We believe an agent with disease-modifying characteristics that safely addresses the underlying cellular overgrowth could provide utility across functional classes and risk categories. 
 
GB002 Product Differentiation 
 GB002 is an orally inhaled PDGF receptor kinase inhibitor designed to build on the evidence of efficacy seen in trials of imatinib while overcoming imatinib’s observed systemic safety issues. GB002 was designed with a higher degree of selectivity as compared to imatinib with increased potency against the PDGF receptor-b isoform, similar potency against the PDGF-a isoform and less activity against c-ABL. We believe GB002 has the potential to be a differentiated PDGF-targeted therapeutic that is designed to potentially provide: 
  
• | an improved response to PDGF-driven abnormal cell proliferation in pulmonary arteries by addressing the underlying mechanism that leads to arterial wall thickening, rather than resultant vasodilation;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a more tolerable safety profile than imatinib due to the direct delivery to the lungs, as supported by the absence of adverse bleeding observed to date in toxicology programs or Phase 1 studies; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a convenient, simple and portable inhalation methodology and delivery system.

Clinical Development History of GB002 
 Summary of Preclinical Program 
 GB002 inhibits both PDGF receptor a and b, and inhibited and reversed cell overgrowth in lung blood vessels in a rat model of PAH, as shown below in Figure 6. This rat model replicates many features of human PAH, including the abnormal cell proliferation that can block the small vessels of the lung. GB002 substantially reduced the occlusive lesions in the small lung blood vessels in this model. Additionally, in this model, GB002 demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in right ventricular systolic pressure as compared to placebo.

Summary of Ongoing Phase 1 Study 
 We are currently conducting Phase 1a SAD and MAD double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies of orally inhaled GB002 in healthy adult volunteers. In the SAD portion of the studies, we have completed five dosing cohorts, each consisting of six volunteers on active drug and two on placebo. We have assessed pharmacokinetics, or PK, parameters and safety. No treatment-related safety issues have been reported during the studies to date. We have completed dosing for three cohorts in the MAD portion of the studies, in which healthy volunteers receive doses of GB002 or placebo for seven days. As of December 31, 2018, no treatment-related safety issues have arisen during the study. 
Summary of Planned Phase 1b Clinical Trial 
 We expect to commence a Phase 1b ascending dose, single-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of GB002 in functional class II and III PAH patients in the first half of 2019. We expect to enroll up to 24 patients in the study and patients will receive two weeks of dosing. The primary goal of the trial is to assess safety, and we also intend to assess certain PK/PD measurements in patients. We anticipate reporting data from our Phase 1b clinical trial in PAH in the first half of 2020. 
Planned Phase 2/3 PAH Clinical Trial 
 We plan to commence a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 clinical trial in functional class III and IV PAH patients in the second half of 2019. We have received FDA feedback through Type C meeting interactions to inform our Phase 2/3 clinical trial design and endpoints. Our planned primary endpoint is the change from baseline in pulmonary vascular resistance at week 24. Key planned secondary endpoints include change from baseline to week 24 in 6MWD and NTproBNP. If we meet the primary endpoint and observe a favorable trend in the key secondary endpoints with a tolerable safety profile, we plan to discuss the possibility of expedited pathways for review and approval with the FDA. We anticipate reporting topline data from our Phase 2/3 clinical trial in PAH in the second half of 2021.

GB004 (HIF-1a Stabilizer) 
 GB004 is a novel, gut-targeted, oral small molecule being developed for the treatment of IBD including UC and CD. GB004 stabilizes HIF through the inhibition of HIF PHDs, key enzymes involved in HIF degradation. Preclinical data from animal models of IBD demonstrated that HIF-1a stabilization restores intestinal epithelial barrier integrity and function, and results in immunomodulatory effects that we believe are important in reducing inflammation and enhancing mucosal healing in IBD patients. We have completed a Phase 1 SAD study in healthy volunteers and are currently dosing healthy volunteers in a Phase 1 MAD study. We plan to pursue clinical development in both UC and CD patients and initiate a Phase 1b clinical trial in UC in the first half of 2019. We also plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial in UC in the first half of 2020. We in-licensed GB004 from Aerpio Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Aerpio, in June 2018 and retain worldwide rights. 
Mechanism of Action 
 IFs have an important role in protecting cells from low oxygen levels. PHDs are enzymes that hydroxylate HIFs when oxygen levels are normal. At low oxygen levels, the activity of PHDs are inhibited, and HIFs are stabilized. Stabilized HIFs subsequently activate the expression of genes that protect cells and promote the healing of tissue that has been injured. Pharmacological inhibition of PHDs can replicate the effects of low oxygen levels on HIF stabilization. 
 IBD represents a state of chronic tissue injury. In IBD animal models, stabilizing HIF through the inhibition of PHD promoted the restoration of intestinal epithelial barrier function and reduction of inflammation. GB004 is a PHD inhibitor designed to be gut-targeted with higher intestinal exposure than systemic exposure. GB004 has also demonstrated greater accumulation of HIF-1a than HIF-2a in IBD animal models. Systemically active PHD inhibitors, which stabilize HIF-2a thereby increasing systemic erythropoietin, or EPO, production by the liver and kidney, are under development for the treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease. By contrast, the use of orally administered GB004, which stabilized HIF-1a in an IBD animal model, did not result in higher red blood cell counts or a clinically significant increase in plasma EPO levels. We believe this is likely a consequence of both the limited systemic exposure of oral GB004 and its predominately selective inhibition of PHDs that stabilize HIF-1a. 
 
Gut-targeting 
 In animal models of IBD, the reduction in inflammation was similar between oral and intravenously-administered GB004. Oral administration resulted in lower systemic exposure and greater accumulation of HIF-1a than HIF-2a without an increase in EPO, blood count or HIF-mediated effects outside of the gastrointestinal, or GI, tract, including in the heart, kidney, and liver. Other data in non-diseased animals have also shown that orally delivered GB004 preferentially concentrated in the GI tract at a rate many times higher than in other organs, such as the heart, kidney or liver. 
 GB004’s potential beneficial effects in IBD can be broken into two categories: restoration of epithelial barrier function and immunomodulation. 
 Restoration of Epithelial Barrier Function 
 HIF-1a expression leads to increases in genes known to promote epithelial integrity and mucosal barrier function. GB004 stabilizes HIF-1a, promoting healing of the intestinal epithelial barrier. The treatment of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) colitis mouse models with GB004 demonstrated statistically significant restitution of the epithelial barrier and mucosal healing as compared to placebo, with similar improvements to dexamethasone, a corticosteriod used for the treatment of moderate-to-severe IBD. While current therapies target the inflammatory response in IBD, GB004 represents a novel mechanism designed to directly enhance the repair of the epithelial barrier. We believe that repairing damage to epithelium and the associated reduction of inflammation would lead to a significant improvement in the symptoms experienced by IBD patients. 
Immunomodulation 
 HIF-1a is an important modulator of the innate and adaptive immune response. HIF-1a increases antimicrobial peptides, factors that protect the host from infection. In addition, HIF-1a may be critical for regulatory immune cell function, which may lead to the reduction of inflammation in IBD. Taken together, HIF-1a mediated effects on innate and adaptive immune responses in the gut may contribute to resolution of inflammation and complement the epithelial barrier protective effects of HIF-1a stabilization. 
 Overview of IBD 
 IBD refers to two conditions, UC and CD, that are characterized by chronic inflammation of the GI tract. 
 16
 
Ulcerative Colitis 
 UC is a chronic GI inflammatory disorder that involves the mucosal lining of the colon. Patients with UC suffer from a multitude of GI symptoms, such as diarrhea, rectal bleeding and weight loss. UC is characterized by a chronic course of remissions and exacerbations. Within 10 years of diagnosis, it is estimated that 20% of adults with UC will have undergone colectomy. 
Crohn’s Disease 
 CD is a chronic, inflammatory condition that involves the full thickness of the wall of the GI tract, and is characterized by erosions, strictures and perforations of the intestine. Symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood in the stool, and weight loss. Maintaining symptomatic control and obtaining remission are critical to minimizing short-term and long-term complications and to improving the outcomes and quality of life for patients with CD. The natural course of CD is a progression from inflammation of the mucosa to stricture formation of the intestine and of mucosal penetration or fistula formation, with the risk of stricture and fistula increasing with the duration of CD. 
 Overview of the IBD Market 
 Approximately three million Americans report being diagnosed with either UC or CD. The U.S. market for IBD biologics reached an estimated $7 billion in 2016 and is projected to grow to over $10 billion by 2025, according to Datamonitor. The current biologic market is dominated by the anti-TNF antibodies Humira, marketed by AbbVie Inc., and Remicade, marketed by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Janssen, and the growing share of the anti-integrin antibody Entyvio, marketed by Takeda Pharmaceuticals America, Inc. 
 Treatment Paradigm in IBD 
 Treatment of IBD consists mainly of immunosuppressive therapies. Treatment choices depend on the patient’s disease severity and responsiveness to therapy. Medications which treat mild to moderate IBD are generally well tolerated. However, as the severity of IBD increases, the potential toxicities of the medications required to manage the disease also increase. For example, treatment of mild to moderate patients typically starts with topical agents, such as 5-aminosalucylic acid, or 5-ASA. For those IBD patients who do not respond to 5-ASAs, or those with more severe disease, corticosteroids are generally used to induce clinical remission. However, longer-term treatment with corticosteroids is associated with multiple adverse effects. Additionally, approximately 38% of patients who initially respond to corticosteroids either become steroid-dependent or require surgery within a year of initiating corticosteroids for UC. 
 Patients with moderately to severely active IBD, who become nonresponsive or intolerant to corticosteroids, are treated with immunomodulators, biologics or a Janus kinase, or JAK, inhibitor. Immunomodulators show a delay in onset of action of one to three months, and can result in neutropenia, pancreatitis, nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity. Therefore, the treatment of IBD patients with moderate-to-severe active disease is dominated by anti-TNF biologics. This paradigm is shifting because of the approval of agents in other classes, such as an anti-integrin, an anti-IL-12 / IL-23 and a JAK inhibitor. Additional immune suppressive therapies for the treatment of IBD are expected in the coming years with the anticipated introduction of oral S1P1 inhibitors and additional oral JAK inhibitors. 
 GB004 Product Differentiation
GB004 is designed to be gut-targeted with higher intestinal exposure than systemic exposure. In IBD animal models, GB004 has demonstrated greater accumulation of HIF-1a than HIF-2a which may lead to restoration of epithelial barrier function and resolution of inflammation, while avoiding the potential adverse effects of increased EPO. 
 GB004 is distinct, and may have a differentiated profile, from the immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive mechanisms of approved IBD medicines and those in late-stage development. By reducing inflammation and potentially restoring intestinal epithelial barrier function and restitution through GB004’s gut-targeted nature and preferential stabilization of HIF-1a, we believe GB004 could improve outcomes for IBD patients. We believe this mechanism has potential as a standalone therapeutic as well as a combination therapy with other therapeutic mechanisms in IBD.

Clinical Development Plan in IBD and Other Indications
Summary of Ongoing Phase 1 SAD and MAD Trial 
 GB004 was evaluated by Aerpio in a first-in-human Phase 1 SAD study in healthy male volunteers. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ascending dose levels of GB004 after single oral administrations. The secondary objective was to characterize PK. A total of 40 subjects were randomized into five cohorts with 8 subjects each. All subjects completed the study. The five dose levels evaluated in this study were 20 mg, 60 mg, 120 mg, and 240 mg in 50 ml of solution and 240 mg in 100 ml of solution. All GB004 doses evaluated in this study were determined to be safe and well tolerated. No deaths or SAEs occurred. There were no significant differences in systemic levels of vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, and EPO between GB004 and placebo patients. 
 We are currently evaluating GB004 in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, MAD study to assess the safety, tolerability, PK and PD effects in healthy male and female volunteers. A total of 40 subjects are planned to be randomized into five cohorts with eight subjects each. Dose levels to be evaluated in the five cohorts are 60 mg and 120 mg per day in male volunteers, 240 mg per day in four male volunteers and four female volunteers, 120 mg per day in female volunteers and 60 mg per day in female volunteers. Volunteers unable to complete seven days of dosing may be replaced. 
 Summary of Planned Phase 1b Clinical Trial in UC 
 We plan to initiate a Phase 1b trial of GB004 in approximately 30 symptomatic adult UC patients in the first half of 2019. Dose selection for this trial will be informed by the results of the MAD study. The goals of the study are to assess safety, tolerability, PK/PD and target engagement of GB004 in patients with UC. We expect to report topline data from this trial in the first half of 2020. We expect to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial in UC in the first half of 2020 and anticipate reporting topline data from the trial by the first half of 2022. 
Our Research Capabilities and Preclinical Programs 
 We currently have three programs in preclinical development and expect to file an IND application with the FDA for one of these programs, GB1275, in the first half of 2019. We are continuing to build our research capabilities, specifically focusing on our areas of expertise within immunology, inflammation and oncology, in order to advance new programs into the clinic, as well as optimize our existing programs. 
 GB1275 (CD11b Agonist)
GB1275 is an oral small molecule, CD11b agonist in preclinical development for the treatment of oncology indications. CD11b and CD18 are members of the integrin family of cell adhesion receptors that combine to form the functional adhesion receptor CD11b / CD18, also known as Mac-1, CR3 or alpha-M beta-2, on cell surfaces. CD11b is highly expressed on myeloid cells of the immune system, including tumor-associated macrophages, or TAMs, and myeloid derived suppressor cells, or MDSCs, which play a significant role in promoting tumor growth, immune evasion and metastasis. Increased presence of CD11b positive MDSCs in tumors is observed across multiple tumor types and is associated with poor prognosis in multiple cancers. 
 The introduction of immune checkpoint therapies has revolutionized the treatment of many cancers in recent years. Despite this, the effectiveness of approved immunotherapies has been limited to a minority of patients in only a small number of approved indications, and many cancers show little to no response to checkpoint therapy. In many cancers, innate immune cells, such as TAMs and MDSCs, are recruited by tumor cells and induced into a suppressive state or polarization, which down-regulates the activation and infiltration of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment, or TME. The result is an immunologically cold tumor state, which allows for tumor growth and metastasis, ultimately resulting in reduced survival. 
 GB1275 is being developed to address the immunological state leading to cold tumors. Recent preclinical data showed that GB1275 reduced tumor influx of CD11b-positive MDSCs and re-polarized immuno-suppressive (M2) TAMs towards the M1 phenotype. These pharmacodynamic effects have the potential to convert the TME from an immunosuppressive to an immunogenic, or active, state, which would ultimately allow the influx of activated CD8+ T-cells and inhibition of tumor progression.
 In pancreatic cancer, a characteristically cold cancer type and one of our initial planned targeted diseases, validation for targeting the immunosuppressive TME has been supported by evidence of durable clinical benefit in trials with an anti-colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor, or anti-CSF1R, antibody plus nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody approved for multiple oncology indications, as well as a C-C chemokine receptor type 2, or CCR2, inhibitor in combination with chemotherapy. 
 18
 
Preclinical studies of GB1275 have demonstrated reduced tumor burden and improved survival as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy and immuno-oncology therapies across multiple tumor models, including pancreatic, breast and colon cancers in mice. Importantly, preclinical data in pancreatic tumor models have shown that GB1275 treatment results in a greater reduction in tumor burden and improved survival as compared to anti-CSF1R antibodies. Preclinical studies and profile characterization of GB1275 support daily oral dosing with no significant preclinical toxicology findings.
 We plan to submit an IND for GB1275 in the first half of 2019 and, after acceptance, initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of GB1275 in 2019. In our Phase 1/2 trial, we anticipate targeting immuno-oncology resistant tumors, such as pancreatic, gastric, esophageal, colorectal, prostate and triple negative breast cancer. We anticipate reporting full data from this trial in 2021. 
 We acquired GB1275 through our acquisition of Adhaere Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in September 2018 for an upfront payment of $7.5 million in cash, up to $62.0 million in regulatory, development and sales milestones and tiered royalties on worldwide net sales at percentages ranging from low to mid-single digits, subject to customary reductions.
 Autoimmune Program
We have a portfolio of novel BTK inhibitors with differentiated selectivity profiles with and without central nervous system penetration. We are currently evaluating these molecules with the goal of advancing an optimized compound into clinical development for the treatment of autoimmune indications. 
 Oncology Program
We are developing small molecule cancer metabolism modulators that have the potential to treat solid tumors that are refractory to currently available checkpoint inhibitors. We are currently evaluating these molecules with the goal of advancing an optimized compound into clinical development for the treatment of solid tumors. 
Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid technological advancement, significant competition and an emphasis on intellectual property. We face potential competition from many different sources, including major and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with current therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects or more convenient than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we do. We believe that the key competitive factors affecting the success of any of our product candidates will include efficacy, safety profile, convenience, cost, level of promotional activity devoted to them and intellectual property protection. 
 We expect to face competition from existing products and products in development for each of our product candidates. GB001, currently in development for the treatment of moderate-to-severe eosinophilic asthma, is an oral DP2 antagonist, a class of medicines with no currently-approved agents. However, other DP2 antagonists are currently in development by Novartis, Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A., Merck & Company, Inc., Sunshine Lake Pharma Co., Ltd. and Idorsia Pharmaceuticals Ltd. If approved, we will also face branded competition from existing biologics, including Xolair (omalizumab/anti-IgE, marketed by Genentech and Novartis) and Dupixent (dupilumab/anti-IL-4/IL-13, marketed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Sanofi S.A.), for moderate to severe asthma, and Nucala (mepolizumab/anti-IL-5, marketed by GlaxoSmithKline), Cinqair (reslizumab/anti-IL-5, marketed by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.), and Fasenra (benralizumab/anti-IL-5, marketed by AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP) for severe eosinophilic asthma. We will also face competition from generic montelukast, which is utilized in mild to moderate patients. Several other agents are advancing in clinical trials for asthma, including tezepelumab, REGN3500 (anti-IL-33; Regeneron), etokimab (anti-IL-33; AnaptysBio, Inc.), GSK3772847 (anti-IL-33; GlaxoSmithKline) and RG6149 (anti-ST2; Genentech). 
 Additionally, while there are no agents currently approved beyond corticosteroids for CRSwNP, several agents approved for or in development for asthma are currently in development for CRSwNP, including Xolair, Fasenra, Dupixent and etokimab. 
 Xolair is currently FDA-approved for the treatment of CSU. We may also face competition from agents currently in development for the indication, including ligelizumab (anti-IgE; Novartis) and AK002 (anti-Siglec-8; Allakos Inc.). 
 GB002 is a potentially first-in-class PDGF receptor kinase inhibitor initially targeted for intermediate and high-risk PAH patients. While potentially unique in our class, we expect our primary competition in this patient set will include prostanoids, available in oral form as Orenitram (United Therapeutics Corporation, or United Therapeutics) and Uptravi (Janssen), by inhalation as Tyvaso 
 19
 
(United Therapeutics), and by infusion as Remodulin (United Therapeutics). While we may face some competition from products used in class I and II patients, such as the oral PDE5 inhibitors, including Revatio (Pfizer Inc.) and Adcirca (United Therapeutics); the sGC stimulator Adempas (Bayer AG); and oral ERAs, including Tracleer (Janssen), Letairis (Gilead Sciences, Inc.) and Opsumit (Janssen), we believe that, if approved, GB002 would be used along with these background therapies. PAH is also an active indication for investigational drugs, and we may face competition in the future from ralinepag (Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and United Therapeutics), sotatercept (Acceleron Pharma, Inc.) and bardoxolone methyl (Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc.). 
 GB004 is potentially a first-in-class HIF-1a stabilizer with the potential to restore epithelial barrier function in patients with IBD. Patients with mild to moderate UC can initially be maintained in remission using a 5-ASA. For those patients who do not respond to 5-ASA, or those with more severe and/or extensive disease at diagnosis, corticosteroids are generally the next line of treatment. Patients who have become nonresponsive or intolerant to corticosteroids may move to azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine. The treatment of severe patients is dominated by anti-TNF biologics, though the paradigm is shifting because of the approval of agents in other classes, such as anti-integrin, IL-12 / IL-23, and JAK inhibitors. Further disruption is expected in the coming years through the introduction of oral S1P1 inhibitors and additional oral JAK inhibitors. 
 There may be other earlier stage clinical programs that, if approved, would compete with our product candidates. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we have. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. Competition may increase further as a result of advances made in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these fields. Our success will be based in part on our ability to build and actively manage a portfolio of drugs that addresses unmet medical needs and creates value in patient therapy. 
 License Agreements 
 Pulmokine
In October 2017, we entered into a license agreement, or the Pulmokine Agreement, with Pulmokine, Inc., under which we were granted an exclusive worldwide license and sublicense to certain intellectual property rights owned or controlled by Pulmokine, including intellectual property rights co-owned by Pulmokine and Gilead Sciences, to develop and commercialize GB002 and certain backup compounds for the treatment, prevention and diagnosis of any and all disease or conditions. We also have the right to sublicense our rights under the Pulmokine Agreement, subject to certain conditions. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one licensed product in the United States and in at least two countries in the European Union. 
 Under the terms of the Pulmokine Agreement, we made an upfront payment of $5.5 million to Pulmokine and are obligated to make future development and regulatory milestone payments of up to $63 million, commercial milestone payments of up to $45 million, and sales milestone payments of up to $190 million. We are also obligated to pay tiered royalties on sales for each licensed product, at percentages ranging from the mid-single digits to the high single-digits. In addition, if we choose to sublicense or assign to any third parties our rights under the Pulmokine Agreement with respect to a licensed product, or our GB002 operating subsidiary undergoes a change of control, we must pay to Pulmokine a specified percentage of all revenue to be received in connection with such transaction. 
 Our royalty obligations and the Pulmokine Agreement will expire on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis on the later of ten years from the date of first commercial sale or when there is no longer a valid patent claim covering such licensed product or specified regulatory exclusivity for the licensed product in such country. The Pulmokine Agreement may be terminated in its entirety either by Pulmokine or by us in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party, in the event the other party is subject to specified bankruptcy, insolvency or similar circumstances, or in the event of a force majeure event under certain circumstances. The agreement may be terminated by Pulmokine if we commence a legal action challenging the validity or enforceability of any licensed patents. We may terminate the agreement, either in its entirety or on a product-by-product basis, in the event of potential safety or efficacy concerns affecting a licensed product. 
 The intellectual property rights co-owned by Pulmokine and Gilead Sciences are subject to a license agreement, or the Gilead Agreement, between Pulmokine and Gilead Sciences. Under the Gilead Agreement, Pulmokine is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one licensed product, which obligation can be satisfied through our development efforts required under the Pulmokine Agreement, and to pay Gilead Sciences future regulatory milestone payments and royalties. Upon termination of the Gilead Agreement for any reason, our sublicense under the Pulmokine Agreement will survive provided that we did not cause a material breach that was the basis for such termination and we agree to be bound by the terms of the Gilead Agreement.

The Pulmokine Agreement also includes a sublicense to patents concerning methods for detecting pulmonary arterial hypertension owned by The Rensselaer Center for Translational Research, Inc., or Rensselaer, and licensed to Pulmokine in an exclusive license agreement, or the Rensselaer License. Under the Rensselaer License, Pulmokine is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one licensed product covered by the Rensselaer patent rights, which obligation can be satisfied through our development efforts. If such obligation is not satisfied by Pulmokine or us, or the Rensselaer License is otherwise terminated for any reason, our sublicense under the Pulmokine Agreement will, at our option, either terminate or, subject to Rensselaer’s approval and our acceptance of the provisions of the Rensselaer License, convert to a license directly between us and Rensselaer. 
 Upon termination of the Pulmokine Agreement for any reason, all rights and licenses granted to us under the agreement will terminate and revert to Pulmokine, and in the event of certain termination events, we would grant Pulmokine worldwide rights to the terminated program. 
 Aerpio Pharmaceuticals
In June 2018, we entered into a license agreement, or the Aerpio Agreement, with Aerpio Pharmaceuticals, Inc., under which we were granted an exclusive worldwide license to certain intellectual property rights owned or controlled by Aerpio to develop and commercialize GB004 and certain other related compounds for all applications. We also have the right to sublicense our rights under the Aerpio Agreement, subject to certain conditions. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one licensed product in the United States, in at least two countries in the European Union, and in Japan, in each case for at least one of the initial indications of UC or CD. The Aerpio Agreement also includes a sublicense to a patent concerning methods for treating inflammatory bowel disease owned by The Regents of the University of Colorado, or UC Regents, and licensed to Aerpio in a nonexclusive license agreement, or the UC Regents License. If Aerpio breaches the UC Regents License and the UC Regents terminate the license, our sublicense under the Aerpio Agreement will also terminate. 
 Under the terms of the Aerpio Agreement, we made an upfront payment of $20 million to Aerpio and are obligated to make future development and regulatory milestone payments of up to $55 million, commercial milestone payments of up to $85 million and sales milestone payments of up to $260 million. We are also obligated to pay tiered royalties on sales for each licensed product, at percentages ranging from a high-single-digit to mid-teens, subject to certain customary reductions. In addition, if we choose to sublicense or assign to any third parties our rights under the Aerpio Agreement with respect to any licensed product or if our GB004 operating subsidiary undergoes a change of control and the value of such transaction exceeds a specified value, we have an option to pay a specified percentage of all revenue to be received in connection with such transaction, and if we exercise the option Aerpio will no longer be paid the development, regulatory, commercial or sales milestones or royalties on the sales of licensed products under the agreement. If we do not exercise our buy-down option with respect to a sublicense or assignment of our rights under the Aerpio Agreement or with respect to a change of control of our GB004 operating subsidiary, Aerpio will have an option to receive a specified percentage of all revenue received in connection with such transaction, and if Aerpio exercises the option Aerpio will no longer be paid the development, regulatory, commercial or sales milestones or royalties on sales of licensed products under the agreement. 
 Our royalty obligations and the Aerpio Agreement will expire on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis on the later of fifteen years from the date of first commercial sale or when there is no longer a valid patent claim covering such licensed product in such country. The agreement may be terminated either by Aerpio or by us in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party or in the event the other party becomes subject to specified bankruptcy, insolvency or similar circumstances. In the event we commence a legal action challenging the validity or enforceability of any licensed patents, Aerpio will have the right to terminate the agreement or elect to increase milestone and royalty payments by a specified percentage. We may terminate the agreement in the event of potential safety or efficacy concerns affecting a licensed product. Upon termination of the agreement for any reason all rights and licenses granted to us under the agreement will terminate, and in the event of certain termination events, we would grant Aerpio worldwide rights to the terminated program. 
 
Manufacturing 
 We currently rely on multiple third-party manufacturers for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing. We intend to rely on third-party contract manufacturers for commercial manufacturing if our product candidates receive marketing approval. Typically, there are multiple sources for all of the materials required for the manufacture of our product candidates. Our manufacturing strategy enables us to more efficiently direct financial resources to the research, development and commercialization of product candidates rather than diverting resources to internally develop manufacturing facilities. As our product candidates advance through development, we expect to enter into longer-term commercial supply agreements with key suppliers and manufacturers to fulfill and secure our production needs.

Intellectual Property 
 We strive to protect the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our proprietary technology and product candidates and continuing innovation to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position. We also plan to rely on data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions when available. Our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our technology, inventions and improvements; to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; to defend and enforce our proprietary rights, including any patents that we may own in the future; and to operate without infringing on the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. Intellectual property rights may not address all potential threats to our competitive advantage. 
 GB001
As of December 31, 2018, with respect to GB001, we owned one issued U.S. patent directed to compound and pharmaceutical composition claims, which is not due to expire before 2026, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustment or extension, and a number of patents and pending patent applications in other jurisdictions, including issued patents in Australia, Canada, China, the European Patent Convention, India, Mexico, New Zealand and Russia, and a pending application in Brazil directed to compound and pharmaceutical composition claims. As of December 31, 2018, we owned one pending U.S. patent application directed to compound claims, which, if issued, is not due to expire before 2037, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustment or extension, and a number of pending patent applications in other jurisdictions, including pending applications in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Patent Convention, India, South Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, and Taiwan directed to compound claims. 
 GB002
As of December 31, 2018, with respect to GB002, we have exclusively licensed one pending U.S. patent application and one pending PCT application owned by Pulmokine directed to method of use claims, which, if issued, is not due to expire before 2037, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustment or extension. We also have exclusively licensed two issued U.S. patents co-owned by Pulmokine and Gilead Sciences, Inc., which are not due to expire before 2034, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustment or extension; two pending U.S. patent applications, which, if issued, are not due to expire before 2034, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustment or extension; and a number of patents and pending patent applications in other jurisdictions, including issued patents in Australia, the European Patent Convention and Japan, and pending applications in Australia, Canada, China, the European Patent Convention and Japan. These patents and patent applications are directed to GB002 compound, formulation and method of use claims. 
 GB004
As of December 31, 2018, with respect to GB004, we have exclusively licensed from Aerpio nine issued U.S. patents directed to compound, pharmaceutical composition and method of use claims, eight of which are not due to expire before 2030, and one, directed to synthetic method claims, is not due to expire before 2035, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustment or extension; one pending U.S. patent application directed to compound and method of use claims, which, if issued, is not due to expire before 2030, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustment or extension; and a number of patents and pending patent applications in other jurisdictions. The patents and pending patent applications directed to compound, pharmaceutical composition and method of use claims in other jurisdictions, and which are not due to expire before 2030, include issued patents in Australia, Canada, China, the European Patent Convention, India, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand and South Korea, and pending patent applications in Brazil, the European Patent Convention, India, Mexico and South Korea. The patents and pending patent applications directed to synthetic method claims in other jurisdictions, and which are not due to expire before 2035, include pending patent applications in China, the European Patent Convention, India and Japan. 
 With respect to our product candidates and processes we intend to develop and commercialize in the normal course of business, we intend to pursue patent protection covering, when possible, compositions, methods of use, dosing and formulations. We may also pursue patent protection with respect to manufacturing and drug development processes and technologies. Obtaining and maintaining patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment, and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies. We may not be able to obtain patent protections for our compositions, methods of use, dosing and formulations, manufacturing and drug development processes and technologies throughout the world. Issued patents can provide protection for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In general, patents issued for applications filed in the United States can provide exclusionary rights for 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. In addition, in certain 
 22
 
instances, the term of an issued U.S. patent that covers or claims an FDA approved product can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period, which is called patent term extension. The restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The term of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with the laws of the foreign jurisdiction, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patent. Patent term may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our products for an adequate amount of time. 
 The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of biopharmaceuticals has emerged in the United States. The relevant patent laws and their interpretation outside of the United States is also uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our technology or product candidates and could affect the value of such intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing products that infringe our intellectual property will depend in part on our success in obtaining and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions and improvements. We cannot guarantee that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may file in the future, nor can we be sure that any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our products, the methods of use or manufacture of those products. Moreover, even our issued patents do not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our products. Patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology space are evolving and involve many risks and uncertainties. For example, third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our product candidates and practicing our proprietary technology, and our issued patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or could limit the term of patent protection that otherwise may exist for our product candidates. In addition, the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies that are outside the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents. For these reasons, we may face competition with respect to our product candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any particular product candidate can be commercialized, any patent protection for such product may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing the commercial advantage the patent provides. 
 Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. A new drug must be approved by the FDA through the new drug application, or NDA, process before it may be legally marketed in the United States. 
 Certain of our product candidates are subject to regulation as combination products, which means that they are composed of both a drug product and device product. If marketed individually, each component would be subject to different regulatory pathways and reviewed by different centers within the FDA. A combination product, however, is assigned to a Center that will have primary jurisdiction over its regulation based on a determination of the combination product’s primary mode of action, which is the single mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action. In the case of our inhaled product candidate regulated as a combination product, the primary mode of action is attributable to the drug component of the product, which means that the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research has primary jurisdiction over the premarket development, review and approval. Accordingly, we plan to investigate this product through the IND framework and seek approval through the NDA pathway. We do not anticipate that the FDA will require a separate medical device authorization for the device, but this could change during the course of its review of any marketing application that we may submit. 
 U.S. Drug Development Process 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of 
 23
 
production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations and other applicable regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current GMP, or cGMP, requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The sponsor will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the first phase of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns about on-going or proposed clinical trials or non-compliance with specific FDA requirements, and the trials may not begin or continue until the FDA notifies the sponsor that the hold has been lifted. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial. 
 All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. They must be conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND as well as any subsequent protocol amendments, and timely safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events. An IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve each protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution and must also approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each trial subject or his or her legal representative, monitor the study until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human volunteers and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. Sponsors sometimes designate their Phase 1 clinical trials as Phase 1a or Phase 1b. Phase 1b clinical trials are typically aimed at confirming dosing, pharmacokinetics and safety in larger number of patients. Some Phase 1b studies evaluate biomarkers or surrogate markers that may be associated with efficacy in patients with specific types of diseases.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 24
 
 
• | Phase 2: This phase involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3: Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide, if appropriate, an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA. 
 The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. In addition, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. Depending on its charter, this group may determine whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. 
 During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meetings at the end of the Phase 2 trial to discuss Phase 2 clinical results and present plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 While the IND is active and before approval, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. 
 There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed trial results to public registries. Sponsors of certain clinical trials of FDA-regulated products are required to register and disclose specified clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. 
 Regulation of Combination Products in the United States 
 Certain products may be comprised of components, such as drug components and device components that would normally be regulated under different types of regulatory authorities, and frequently by different centers at the FDA. These products are known as combination products. Specifically, under regulations issued by the FDA, a combination product may be: 

• | a product comprised of two or more regulated components that are physically, chemically, or otherwise combined or mixed and produced as a single entity;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprised of drug and device products, device and biological products, or biological and drug products;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 25
 
 
• | a drug, or device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its investigational plan or proposed labeling is intended for use only with an approved individually specified drug, or device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect and where upon approval of the proposed product the labeling of the approved product would need to be changed, e.g., to reflect a change in intended use, dosage form, strength, route of administration, or significant change in dose; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | any investigational drug, or device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its proposed labeling is for use only with another individually specified investigational drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Under the FDCA and its implementing regulations, the FDA is charged with assigning a center with primary jurisdiction, or a lead center, for review of a combination product. The designation of a lead center generally eliminates the need to receive approvals from more than one FDA component for combination products, although it does not preclude consultations by the lead center with other components of FDA. The determination of which center will be the lead center is based on the “primary mode of action” of the combination product. Thus, if the primary mode of action of a drug-device combination product is attributable to the drug product, the FDA center responsible for premarket review of the drug product would have primary jurisdiction for the combination product. The FDA has also established an Office of Combination Products to address issues surrounding combination products and provide more certainty to the regulatory review process. That office serves as a focal point for combination product issues for agency reviewers and industry. It is also responsible for developing guidance and regulations to clarify the regulation of combination products, and for assignment of the FDA center that has primary jurisdiction for review of combination products where the jurisdiction is unclear or in dispute. 
 A combination product with a drug primary mode of action generally would be reviewed and approved pursuant to the drug approval processes under the FDCA. In reviewing the NDA application for such a product, however, FDA reviewers in the drug center could consult with their counterparts in the device center to ensure that the device component of the combination product met applicable requirements regarding safety, effectiveness, durability and performance. In addition, under FDA regulations, combination products are subject to cGMP requirements applicable to both drugs and devices, including the Quality System, or QS, regulations applicable to medical devices. 
 
NDA Review and Approval Process 
 The results of product development, preclinical and other non-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision after it the application is submitted. The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. 
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. 
 After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA and may require additional clinical data, such as an 
 26
 
additional pivotal Phase 3 trial or other significant and time consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the sponsor must resubmit the NDA or, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. 
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. In addition, the FDA may require a sponsor to conduct Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval, and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approval including the requirement for a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Marketing approval may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory requirements or if problems occur following initial marketing. 
 
The Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs and supplements must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation. 
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or, if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or inability to manufacture the product in sufficient quantities. The designation of such drug also entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding toward clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. However, competitors, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our product candidates for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. 
 In addition, if an orphan designated product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan exclusivity. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or, as noted above, if the second applicant demonstrates that its product is clinically superior to the approved product with orphan exclusivity or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. GB002 has received orphan drug designation for the treatment of patients with PAH.

Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate FDA’s review and approval of new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. The FDA has a fast track designation program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drug products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Unique to a fast track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. 
 Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a fast track designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. The FDA endeavors to review applications with priority review designations within six months of the filing date as compared to ten months for review of new molecular entity NDAs under its current PDUFA review goals. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval. 
 In addition, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug products intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. FDA may withdraw approval of a drug or indication approved under accelerated approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product. 
 The FDA Safety and Innovation Act established a category of drugs referred to as “breakthrough therapies” that may be eligible to receive breakthrough therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy” if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. If the FDA designates a breakthrough therapy, it may take actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application, which may include holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the therapy; providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable; involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor; and considering alternative clinical trial designs when scientifically appropriate, which may result in smaller trials or more efficient trials that require less time to complete and may minimize the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, which means that the sponsor may file sections of the NDA for review on a rolling basis if certain conditions are satisfied, including an agreement with FDA on the proposed schedule for submission of portions of the application and the payment of applicable user fees before the FDA may initiate a review. The breakthrough therapy designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, which can also be granted to the same drug if relevant criteria are met. If a product is designated as breakthrough therapy, the FDA will work to expedite the development and review of such drug. 
 
Fast track designation, priority review and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We may explore some of these opportunities for our product candidates as appropriate. 
 28
 
Post-Approval Requirements 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, certain manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP regulations and other laws and regulations. In addition, the FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. 
 Any drug products manufactured or distributed by us or our partners pursuant to FDA approvals will be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the drug, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, drug sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market and imposes requirements and restrictions on drug manufacturers, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. 
 Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical holds on post-approval clinical trials, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. 
 Marketing Exclusivity 
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2), or 505(b)(2) NDA, submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. 
 The FDCA alternatively provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of marketing exclusivity available in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity attached to another period of exclusivity if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA. The issuance of a written request does not require the sponsor to undertake the 
 29
 
described clinical trials. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity, as described above, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances. 
 U.S. Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidate for which we may seek regulatory approval. Sales in the United States will depend, in part, on the availability of sufficient coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, which include government health programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and the Veterans Administration, as well as managed care organizations and private health insurers. Prices at which we or our customers seek reimbursement for our product candidates can be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by third-party payors. 
 The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. A third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be available. Additionally, in the United States there is no uniform policy among payors for coverage or reimbursement. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies, but also have their own methods and approval processes. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. If coverage and adequate reimbursement are not available, or are available only at limited levels, successful commercialization of, and obtaining a satisfactory financial return on, any product we develop may not be possible. 
 Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for marketing, we may need to conduct expensive studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of any products, which would be in addition to the costs expended to obtain regulatory approvals. Third-party payors may not consider our product candidates to be medically necessary or cost-effective compared to other available therapies, or the rebate percentages required to secure favorable coverage may not yield an adequate margin over cost or may not enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development. 
 
U.S. Healthcare Reform 
 In the United States, there has been, and continues to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect the profitable sale of product candidates. 
 Among policy makers and payors in the United States, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, was passed, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things: (1) increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; (2) created a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for certain drugs and biologics that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; (3) established an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs; (4) expanded the availability of lower pricing under the 340B drug pricing program by adding new entities to the program; (5) expanded the eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; (6) created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; (7) created a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (and 70% commencing January 1, 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; (8) established a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and (9) established a Center for Medicare Innovation at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drugs. 
 Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial and political challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health 
 30
 
insurance mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or Tax Act, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.” In July 2018, CMS published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the ACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, or Texas District Court Judge, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inserverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. While the Texas District Court Judge, as well as the Trump Administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA. 
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was signed into law, which, among other things, resulted in aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the BBA, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
 Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Additionally, the Trump administration released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has begun the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same time, is implementing others under its existing authority. Although some of these, and other proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
 Additionally, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017, or Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA approval under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act. 
 U.S. Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 Federal and state healthcare laws and regulations restrict business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. These laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws and regulations, data privacy and security, and transparency laws and regulations. 
 31
 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act and the civil monetary penalties statute. 
 The federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalties laws, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any individual or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. 
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal civil and criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program. In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of protected health information on HIPAA covered entities, which include certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, and their business associates who conduct certain activities for or on their behalf involving protected health information on their behalf. 
 The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to CMS information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. 
 Similar state and local laws and regulations may also restrict business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or by patients themselves; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws and regulations that require drug manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information or which require tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to physicians, other healthcare providers and entities; state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and state and local laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 Efforts to ensure compliance with applicable healthcare laws and regulations can involve substantial costs. Violations of healthcare laws can result in significant penalties, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other U.S. healthcare programs, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment or restructuring of operations. 
 Foreign Regulation 
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union, or EU, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. 
 32
 
To market a medicinal product in the European Economic Area, or EEA (which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), we must obtain a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations: 
  
• | the Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products, and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment certain diseases, such as AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member State through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. 
 Data and marketing exclusivity 
 In the EEA, new products authorized for marketing, or reference products, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until 10 years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The 10-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. 
 
Pediatric investigation plan 
 In the EEA, marketing authorization applications for new medicinal products not authorized have to include the results of studies conducted in the pediatric population, in compliance with a pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, agreed with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee, or PDCO. The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which marketing authorization is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when these data is not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Once the marketing authorization is obtained in all Member States of the EU and study results are included in the product information, even when negative, the product is eligible for six months’ supplementary protection certificate extension. 
 Orphan drug designation 
 In the EEA, a medicinal product can be designated as an orphan drug if its sponsor can establish that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the EU when the application is made, or that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Community and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the EU would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition. 
 33
 
In the EEA, an application for designation as an orphan product can be made any time prior to the filing of an application for approval to market the product. Marketing authorization for an orphan drug leads to a ten-year period of market exclusivity. During this market exclusivity period, the EMA or the member state competent authorities, cannot accept another application for a marketing authorization, or grant a marketing authorization, for a similar medicinal product for the same indication. The period of market exclusivity is extended by two years for medicines that have also complied with an agreed PIP. 
 This period may, however, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation, for example because the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify market exclusivity. Market exclusivity can be revoked only in very selected cases, such as consent from the marketing authorization holder, inability to supply sufficient quantities of the product, demonstration of “clinical superiority” by a similar medicinal product, or, after a review by the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, requested by a member state in the fifth year of the marketing exclusivity period (if the designation criteria are believed to no longer apply). Medicinal products designated as orphan drugs pursuant are eligible for incentives made available by the EU and its Member States to support research into, and the development and availability of, orphan drugs. 
 Clinical trials 
 Clinical trials of medicinal products in the European Union must be conducted in accordance with European Union and national regulations and the International Conference on Harmonization, or ICH, guidelines on GCPs. Additional GCP guidelines from the European Commission, focusing in particular on traceability, apply to clinical trials of advanced therapy medicinal products. If the sponsor of the clinical trial is not established within the European Union, it must appoint an entity within the European Union to act as its legal representative. The sponsor must take out a clinical trial insurance policy, and in most EU countries, the sponsor is liable to provide ‘no fault’ compensation to any study subject injured in the clinical trial. 
 
Prior to commencing a clinical trial, the sponsor must obtain a clinical trial authorization from the competent authority, and a positive opinion from an independent ethics committee. The application for a clinical trial authorization must include, among other things, a copy of the trial protocol and an investigational medicinal product dossier containing information about the manufacture and quality of the medicinal product under investigation. Currently, clinical trial authorization applications must be submitted to the competent authority in each EU Member State in which the trial will be conducted. Under the new Regulation on Clinical Trials, which is currently expected to take effect in 2019, there will be a centralized application procedure where one national authority takes the lead in reviewing the application and the other national authorities have only a limited involvement. Any substantial changes to the trial protocol or other information submitted with the clinical trial applications must be notified to or approved by the relevant competent authorities and ethics committees. Medicines used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cGMP. Other national and European Union-wide regulatory requirements also apply. 
 Privacy and data protection laws 
 We are also subject to laws and regulations in non-U.S. countries covering data privacy and the protection of health-related and other personal information. EU member states and other jurisdictions have adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. Laws and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, disclosure, processing and security of personal information that identifies or may be used to identify an individual, such as names, contact information, and sensitive personal data such as health data. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent revisions and differing interpretations, and have generally become more stringent over time. 
 As of May 25, 2018, Regulation 2016/676, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, replaced the Data Protection Directive with respect to the processing of personal data in the European Union. The GDPR imposes many requirements for controllers and processors of personal data, including, for example, higher standards for obtaining consent from individuals to process their personal data, more robust disclosures to individuals and a strengthened individual data rights regime, shortened timelines for data breach notifications, limitations on retention and secondary use of information, increased requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data and additional obligations when we contract third-party processors in connection with the processing of the personal data. The GDPR allows EU member states to make additional laws and regulations further limiting the processing of genetic, biometric or health data. Failure to comply with the requirements of GDPR and the applicable national data protection laws of the EU member states may result in fines of up to €20,000,000 or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, and other administrative penalties.
