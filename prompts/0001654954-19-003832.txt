  Item 1. Business
  
  Overview of Market
  
 Founded in 1979, Information Analysis Incorporated, which we sometimes refer to as the Company or IAI, is in the business of developing and maintaining information technology (IT) systems, modernizing client information systems, and performing professional services to government and commercial organizations. Since its inception, we have performed software development and conversion projects for over 100 commercial and government customers including, but not limited to the Department of Agriculture, Department of Defense, Department of Education, Department of Energy, Department of Homeland Security, Department of the Treasury, U.S. Small Business Administration, U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force, Department of Veterans Affairs, Citibank, and General Dynamics Information Technology (formerly Computer Sciences Corporation, CSRA). At present, we primarily apply our technology, services and experience to developing web-based and mobile device solutions (including electronic forms conversions) for various agencies of the federal government, data analytics, and legacy software migration and modernization.
 Digital Solutions Marketplace
  
 The web, digital content, and cloud solutions market continues to be one of the fastest growing segments of the information technology professional services business as small and large companies, and government agencies (state and federal) expand their presence via cloud implementations and on the Internet. The range of products and services involved in this sector is extensive and therefore, require some specialization for a small company such as IAI to make an impact. Most small web companies are involved in building websites and typically have many short duration projects. More complex web applications generally require knowledge of customers’ back-end systems based on mainframe or mid-level computers. Few small companies have the expertise to develop these more sophisticated web applications. We distinguish ourselves among smaller companies by having such expertise, typically associated with larger companies, both internally and through strategic business relationships with leading-edge software firms, such as Adobe Systems.

 Given executive level directives to improve outreach to its stakeholders, federal and state government agencies are now empowered to find means of facilitating dissemination of information quickly and efficiently. Government requirements are unique in that most government processes are based on forms. Many government agencies rely on thousands of internal and external forms to conduct their business. Any company that wishes to develop governmental web applications must competently address the forms issue. Adobe electronic forms related products resold and supported by IAI as a solutions partner are the predominant forms software in the federal government.
  
 Over the last few years there has been a pronounced emphasis within the U.S. federal government to employ more form data entry and citizen communication using mobile devices such as iPhones, iPads, and mobile devices employing the Android operating system. Working with Adobe’s latest version of Adobe Experience Manager (AEM), we have been able to build applications for several federal clients employing mobile devices, as well as converting paper-based forms into “dynamic” or “adaptive” forms.
  
  Legacy Migration and Modernization
  
 The migration and modernization market is complex and diverse as to the multiple requirements clients possess to upgrade their older systems. Many large legacy systems remain in use because of the enormous cost to re-engineer these systems. Currently, the options available to modernize these systems are many and include introduction of new hardware systems, employing advanced software languages, and utilization of the Internet or Intranet to achieve desired efficiencies. All of these options are typically very expensive and time consuming because they require starting all over in defining requirements, designing structures, programming, and testing.
  
 Opportunities for our modernization expertise continue to exist as government agencies and private companies are being driven for various reasons, including increased funding by federal and state legislatures, to address the upgrading of their legacy systems. One reason is the difficulty of finding and retaining staff with outdated technical skills, many of which are possessed only by senior programmers nearing retirement. Hardware platforms such as Unisys are reaching the horizon of their usefulness, and consequently, older programming and data base languages are generally poorly supported by their providers. Additionally, maintenance costs are materially increasing as vendors squeeze the most out of clients before the life-cycles of hardware and software expire. In addition, the Internet has added a new level of pressure to compete in the electronic marketplace with sector rivals. We expect that the foreseeable future should see an upsurge of movement and change as organizations revamp their older legacy systems.
  
 A segment of mainframe users is interested in simply updating their legacy systems without drastic rewritings to these systems in newer languages or adapting expensive enterprise products (such as SAP or Oracle) to their needs. These potential customers are looking for automated tools that can quickly and cost-effectively move applications onto cheaper computer platforms without the risk of failure. IAI, in conjunction with strategic partners, such as Micro Focus and Software Mining, offers its own conversion tool set and those of its partners in addressing this need and positioning us to uniquely deliver successful results. It is difficult to determine the exact size of this segment, but even a minor share of this market would represent significant prospective customers with meaningful opportunities. In December 2016, we were notified that IAI was one of a number of subcontractors that were part of a prime contractor’s team that was awarded a contract with the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) 504 loan program. Under the contract, IAI personnel provide analysis and modernization activities to the SBA program platform. IAI personnel worked extensively in calendar year 2017 on their assigned tasks and were significant team contributors to a successful implementation of the modernized application in the first quarter 2018. As a side benefit on this project, IAI recruited a team of exceptional programmers versed in Adobe Cold Fusion technology, which was used extensively on the SBA 504 loan program. This added capability adds to our unique set of capabilities and differentiates us from other modernization companies.
  
 Because of IAI’s unique modernization capabilities, IAI has been approached by various companies, some very large, to collaborate on modernization opportunities that are suddenly imminent for a number of federal agencies. We interpret this as a positive sign that our backlog of modernization activities will expand over the next three years.

  Description of Business and Strategy
  
 With the advent of mobile and digital technology applications becoming widespread in everyday life, coupled with government agencies seeking better ways to improve outreach to its stakeholders, we intend to capitalize on our proven expertise in this arena and capture new business opportunities that are likely to arise in the foreseeable future. This includes the conversion of paper-based forms into digitally compatible “dynamic” and “adaptive” forms, as well as developing mobile and Internet based applications that replace cumbersome paper handling processes currently in use by diverse organizations.
  
 We are using the experience we have acquired as an Adobe solutions partner and reseller to help secure engagements for web-based applications requiring forms. The Adobe Experience Manager products have evolved over the years into robust tools that can form the backbone of applications, especially those requiring forms and web content management. We have used this expertise to penetrate a number of federal government clients such as the Internal Revenue Service and Veterans Affairs and build sophisticated web applications at the Department of Homeland Security. One such application, a parking and transit subsidy tool, was cited for award recognition by the American Council for Technology – Industry Advisory Council (ACT-IAC) and Federal Computer Week’s Fed 100 Awards. Our knowledge of legacy system languages has been instrumental in connecting these web applications to legacy databases residing on mainframe computers. Our Company has built a core group of professionals that can continue to build this practice over the coming years. In addition, IAI, operating as a prime contractor, has teamed with Adobe Systems to provide AEM Assets govCloud services to DoD’s Defense Security Services and AEM related application consulting to the Defense Finance and Accounting Services.
  
 Concentrating on the niche of electronic forms-related web applications (including securing digital content and documents) through our solutions partner relationship with Adobe AEM products, we have developed a cadre of professionals that can quickly and efficiently develop web applications. We will focus on federal government clients during 2019 and beyond and leverage the Company’s reputation with existing federal customers to penetrate other agencies. We will be able to reference successful projects completed or in development for various components of the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs, Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, Department of Agriculture, Department of Education, General Services Administration, U.S. Army Reserve, and U.S. Air Force Logistics Command.
  
 As a recent example of our capability, IAI was contracted by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services agency (USCIS) to provide technical and design support to complete development of an enhanced Form I-9 (Employment Eligibility Verification) that incorporates drop-down menus, helper text and hover text that embed the instructions into the form, field logic, error messages and form validation into a fillable PDF format. IAI’s successful programming of the enhanced form per our client’s requirements led to the form’s release by the government in September 2017 to the general public as USCIS’s official form for that designated purpose.
  
 In an effort to increase IAI’s profile and visibility in the expanding digital technology marketplace, IAI personnel have actively participated in industry programs such as the Adobe Digital Government Assembly and the Department of Homeland Security’s Government Forms Forum, which bring together senior government officials, technology leaders and information technology leaders interested in advances in digital technology applications. IAI senior staff typically participate in related panel discussions and IAI exhibits its digital related competencies and innovative capabilities to the attendees.
  
 We recognize the need to enhance our service and product capabilities as a means of expanding our business base and maintaining growth in the future. To that end, over the last several years, we have aggressively pursued strategic business relationships with certain technology firms in our local area that have developed unique and innovative software-based products and services. These new business areas include, but are not limited to, legacy modernization applications and expanded product opportunities. In addition, we have teamed with other local technology firms on proposal submissions to federal government agencies to gain access to Government Wide Acquisition Contracts, such as the Navy’s multiple SeaPort NxG contract.

 Where appropriate, we have entered into teaming arrangements or product reseller agreements with certain of these firms. These products and services are synergistic to our present business strategy and also allow us to expand into new business areas, both within the federal government and commercial sectors, without the expenditure of significant technical development dollars. Our partners benefit by our potential to leverage their new technology developments into our existing client base, as well as utilize our expertise and credibility in developing applications around their inventive products.
  
 Since the mid-1990’s we have migrated customers, both private firms and government agencies, from older computer languages generally associated with legacy computer systems to more modern languages used with current-day computer system platforms. As part of this modernization, many organizations wish to extend these legacy systems to interface with web-based applications. Our strategy has been to develop and/or acquire tools through strategic relationships that will facilitate the modernization process and differentiate our offerings in the marketplace.
  
 In 2004, we aligned with Micro Focus, an established company in the legacy COBOL environment, to jointly participate in the conversion of large legacy mainframe systems to PC and Unix server platforms. Micro Focus has developed a suite of products that simplify the conversion process and enable the entry screens to be Internet accessible. As an authorized reseller and installer of the Micro Focus tools, our plan is to derive revenue from software sales and installation services as well as acquire supplementary programming services that typically may occur with each engagement.
  
 We have structured our Company to address the wide range of requirements that we envision the market will demand. We believe that the use of our proprietary ICONS legacy conversion tools suite and that of our strategic partners will give us a competitive edge in performing certain conversions and migrations faster and more economically than many other vendors. The diverse capabilities of our staff in mainframe technology and client-server implementations help to assure that our staff can analyze the original systems properly to conduct accurate and thorough conversions both from a technical and business perspective. In addition, our modernization methodology has evolved over time through the successful completion of numerous conversion projects.
  
 Our strategy to exploit the conversion and modernization market is also predicated on continuing to form alliances with large information technology consulting firms who currently maintain the legacy systems for large government agencies and Fortune 1000 companies. These alliances have resulted in significant opportunities in the past and are likely to be important in procuring future business.
  
 Our management will generally continue to explore ways to expand our current market spaces and develop new ones that may offer more opportunity. This may take the shape of organic growth or through acquisition or merger with other companies. In any event, IAI will explore the potential of diversified business opportunities and seek targets of acquisition.
  
  We are a small business team member on the Defense Logistics Agency’s (DLA) J6 Enterprise Technical Services (JETS) contract. The DLA JETS contract is a five-year, $6.015B ceiling, base Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract vehicle for a full range of IT services as well as technical and management expertise that supports applications, software, hardware, infrastructure, and systems, across the DLA Enterprise. Additionally, this contract vehicle is available for use by other Department of Defense agencies and organizations.
  
 Certain government contracts related to IAI’s business are now limiting future awards to companies certified under designated quality management systems such as ISO 9001:2015. The ISO 9001 family of quality management systems is designed to help organizations ensure that they meet the needs of customers and other stakeholders while meeting statutory and regulatory requirements related to a product or program. Third-party certification bodies provide independent confirmation that organizations meet the requirements of ISO 9001. In the second half of 2016, IAI developed the processes and procedures required by the ISO 9001:2015 so as to be in compliance with this standard and expand our ability to bid on future contracts that require such certification. We received notice by the independent registrar in June 2017 that IAI passed its Stage Two Audit and was subsequently awarded ISO 9001:2015 certification. IAI continues to undergo periodic internal and external audits as required by regulations to ensure compliance with the ISO quality management standard. IAI has subsequently passed all such follow-on surveillance audits to date.

  Backlog
  
 As of December 31, 2018, we estimated our backlog at approximately $13.2 million over the next three years, of which $2.9 million was funded. This backlog consists of outstanding contracts and general commitments from current clients. We regularly provide services to certain clients on an as-needed basis without regard to a specific contract. General commitments represent those services which we anticipate providing to such clients during a twelve-month period.
 Competition
  
 In the ever-expanding realm of enterprise-based web content management systems, there are a number of small and large companies offering such software products and related consulting services. We believe that the Adobe Experience Manager product suite will continue to dominate in the future against such competition, including offerings such as Microsoft’s SharePoint solution. AEM has performed well in the federal marketplace due to its full offering of powerful capabilities such as cloud integration and intuitive customization. Adobe Experience Manager is a solution that optimizes the authoring, management and delivery of digital media and content across owned channels, including Web, mobile, email, print and social communities. In 2018, Gartner named Adobe as a leader in multiple categories of its Magic Quadrant reporting including, but not limited to, Digital Experience Platforms, Web Content Management, Personalization Engines and Content Marketing Platforms.
  
 There are hundreds of firms performing traditional information technology services, business intelligence and cybersecurity, and general consulting for the federal government. A great number of them are much larger than IAI, and are more established in the marketplace, and have more resources to pursue individual prospects.
  
 The competition in the conversion and modernization market is very strong. Many software professional services companies have had some involvement in this area and profess proficiency in performing these projects. We also face competition from other companies that purport to substantially automate the process through software tools including Blue Phoenix Solutions, Fujitsu, and IBM. Software for enterprise resource planning, such as SAP and Oracle, provides an additional source of competition, although to date, the cost and lengthy installation time for enterprise resource planning software has slowed its implementation in the market place. No matter what type of solution is offered, many of our competitors have greater name recognition than our company, a larger, more established customer base, and significantly greater financial and market resources.
  
  Government Regulation
  
 We are bound by various rules and regulations promulgated by the federal government and agencies thereunder. We have not experienced undue expense beyond those expenses normally incurred in our ordinary course of business in adhering to such rules and regulations. Since historically most of our business is derived from contracts either directly with the U.S. federal government or as a subcontractor on behalf of U.S. federal government customers, most of our contracts are subject to termination at the election of the government.
 Intellectual Property
  
 We depend upon a combination of trade secret and copyright laws, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our methodologies, databases and software. We have not filed any patent applications covering our methodologies and software. In addition, we attempt to protect the secrecy of our proprietary databases and other trade secrets and proprietary information through agreements with employees and consultants.
  
 We also seek to protect the source code of our proprietary ICONS legacy code conversion tools suite as trade secrets. The copyright protection accorded to databases, however, is fairly limited. While the arrangement and selection of data can be protected, the actual data is not, and others are free to create software performing the same function. We believe, however, that the creation of competing databases would be very time consuming and costly.
  
  Employees
  
 As of December 31, 2018, we employed twenty-one full-time and three part-time individuals. In addition, we maintained subcontractor relationships with companies and individuals that add eight individuals for professional information technology services. All of our billable professional employees have at least four years of related experience. For computer related services, we believe that the diverse professional opportunities and interaction among our employees contribute to maintaining a stable professional staff with limited turnover.
  
 We have no collective bargaining agreements or other such labor contracts with our employees and believe that our employee relationships are satisfactory. In the long-term, management will likely hire additional staff to meet its anticipated growth requirements. We do not anticipate encountering material problems in our ability to hire individuals with the requisite employee skill sets, despite a competitive market for our requisite technical skill sets and government clearances, when required. We utilize fee-based recruiting firms when it is necessary to speed up the process of locating and hiring employees with specialized skill sets and clearances.
