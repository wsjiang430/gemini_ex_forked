INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY
INDEX TO ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K
FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018
ITEM 1. BUSINESS
GENERAL
International Paper Company (the Company or International Paper, which may also be referred to as we or us) is a global producer of renewable fiber-based packaging, pulp and paper products with manufacturing operations in North America, Latin America, Europe, North Africa, India and Russia. We are a New York corporation, incorporated in 1941 as the successor to the New York corporation of the same name organized in 1898. You can learn more about us by visiting our website at www.internationalpaper.com.
In the United States, at December 31, 2018, the Company operated 27 pulp, paper and packaging mills, 166 converting and packaging plants, 16 recycling plants and three bag facilities. Production facilities at December 31, 2018 in Canada, Europe, India, North Africa, and Latin America included 16 pulp, paper and packaging mills, 43 converting and packaging plants, and two recycling plants. We operate a printing and packaging products distribution business principally through nine branches in Asia. At December 31, 2018, we owned or managed approximately 329,000 acres of forestland in Brazil and had, through licenses and forest management agreements, harvesting rights on government-owned forestlands in Russia. Substantially all of our businesses have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, cycles relating to industry capacity and general economic conditions.
For management and financial reporting purposes, our businesses are separated into three segments: Industrial Packaging; Global Cellulose Fibers; and Printing Papers. 
A description of these business segments can be found on pages 23 and 24 of Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The Company’s 50% equity interest in Ilim S.A. (Ilim) is also a separate reportable industry segment.
From 2014 through 2018, International Paper’s capital expenditures approximated $7.2 billion, excluding mergers and acquisitions. These expenditures reflect our continuing efforts to use our capital strategically to improve product quality and environmental performance, as well as lower costs and maintain reliability of operations. Capital spending in 2018 was approximately $1.6 billion and is expected to be approximately $1.4 billion in 2019. You can find more information about capital expenditures on page 28 of Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.


Discussions of acquisitions can be found on page 29 of Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
You can find discussions of restructuring charges and other special items on pages 22 and 23 of Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we “incorporate by reference” certain information in parts of other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC permits us to disclose important information by referring to it in that manner. Please refer to such information. Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, along with all other reports and any amendments thereto filed with or furnished to the SEC, are publicly available free of charge on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.internationalpaper.com as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. The information contained on or connected to our website is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K and should not be considered part of this or any other report that we filed with or furnished to the SEC.
COMPETITION AND COSTS
The pulp, paper and packaging sectors are large and fragmented, and the areas into which the Company sells its principal products are very competitive. Our products compete with similar products produced by other forest products companies. We also compete, in some instances, with companies in other industries and against substitutes for wood-fiber products.
Many factors influence the Company’s competitive position, including price, cost, product quality and services. You can find more information about the impact of these factors on operating profits on pages 17 through 28 of Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. You can find information about the Company’s manufacturing capacities on page A-4 of Appendix II.
MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION
The Company sells products directly to end users and converters, as well as through agents, resellers and paper distributors. 
DESCRIPTION OF PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS
The Company’s principal products are described on pages 23 and 24 of Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
The Company operates its primary research and development center in Loveland, Ohio, as well as several other product development facilities, including the Global Cellulose Fibers technology center in Federal Way, Washington.
We direct research and development activities to short-term, long-term and technical assistance needs of customers and operating divisions, and to process, equipment and product innovations. Activities include product development within the operating divisions; studies on innovation and improvement of pulping, bleaching, chemical recovery, paper making, converting and coating processes; packaging design and materials development; mechanical packaging systems, environmentally sensitive printing inks and reduction of environmental discharges; re-use of raw materials in manufacturing processes; recycling of consumer and packaging paper products; energy conservation; applications of computer controls to 


manufacturing operations; innovations and improvement of products; and development of various new products. Our development efforts specifically address product safety, as well as the minimization of solid waste. The cost to the Company of its research and development operations was $30 million in 2018, $28 million in 2017, and $20 million in 2016.
We own numerous patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights relating to our products and to the processes for their production. We also license intellectual property rights to and from others where advantageous or necessary. Many of the manufacturing processes are among our trade secrets. Some of our products are covered by U.S. and non-U.S. patents and are sold under well known trademarks. We derive a competitive advantage by protecting our trade secrets, patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, and by using them as required to support our businesses.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
International Paper is subject to extensive federal and state environmental regulation, as well as similar regulations internationally. Our continuing objectives include: (1) controlling emissions and discharges from our facilities into the air, water and groundwater to avoid adverse impacts on the environment, and (2) maintaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Company spent $47 million in 2018 for capital projects to control environmental releases into the air and water, and to assure environmentally sound management and disposal of waste. We expect to spend $70 million in 2019 for environmental capital projects. Capital expenditures for 2020 environmental projects are anticipated to be approximately $70 million. Capital expenditures for 2021 environmental projects are estimated to be $95 million.
The Company has completed capital projects to meet the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Boiler MACT (maximum achievable control technology) regulations that require owners of specified boilers to meet revised air emissions standards for certain substances. Since 2016, lawsuits challenging all or portions of the Boiler MACT regulations have resulted in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit remanding certain portions of the Boiler MACT regulations to the EPA for reconsideration of certain standards in the regulations. We have not identified any additional Boiler MACT capital project expenditures that might result from the outcome of the remands to the EPA. 
Amendments lowering National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), fine particulate (PM2.5), and ozone have been finalized by the EPA in recent years but to date have not had a material impact on the Company.
CLIMATE CHANGE
In an effort to mitigate the potential climate change impacts from human activities, various international, national and sub-national (regional, state and local) governmental actions have been or may be undertaken. Presently, these efforts have not materially impacted International Paper, but such efforts may have a material impact on the Company in the future.
International Efforts
A successor program to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the Paris Agreement, went into effect in November 2016 and continued international efforts and voluntary commitments toward reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Consistent with this objective, participating countries aim to balance GHG 


emissions generation and removal in the second half of this century or, in effect, achieve net-zero global GHG emissions.
As part of the Paris Agreement, many countries, including the U.S. and EU member states, established non-binding emissions reduction targets. The U.S. non-binding commitment is for GHG emissions to be 7% below 2005 GHG emissions levels by 2020 and 26% to 28% below by 2025. Other countries in which we do business made similar non-binding commitments. On August 4, 2017, the U.S. filed official notice to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. Notwithstanding the notice of withdrawal by the U.S., the Company’s voluntary GHG reductions, which are set out in our annual Global Citizenship report, remain roughly in line with the percentages of the U.S. prior target reductions. It is not clear at this time what, if any, further reductions by the Company might be required by the countries in which we operate. Due to this uncertainty, it is not possible at this time to estimate the potential impacts of these agreements on the Company.
To assist member countries in meeting obligations under the Kyoto Protocol, the EU established and continues to operate an Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). Currently, we have two sites directly subject to regulation under Phase III of the EU ETS, one in Poland and one in France. Other sites that we operate in the EU experience indirect impacts of the EU ETS through purchased power pricing. Neither the direct nor indirect impacts of the EU ETS have been material to the Company, but they could be material to the Company in the future depending on how the Paris Agreement's non-binding commitments or allocation of and market prices for GHG credits under existing rules evolve over the coming years.
U.S. Efforts, including State, Regional and Local Measures
In the U.S., the 1997 Kyoto Protocol was not ratified and Congress has not passed GHG legislation. The EPA manages regulations to: (i) control GHGs from mobile sources by adopting transportation fuel efficiency standards; (ii) control GHG emissions from new Electric Generating Units (EGUs); (iii) require reporting of GHGs from sources of GHGs greater than 25,000 tons per year; (iv) in 2015, require states to develop plans to reduce GHGs from utility EGUs and (v) in 2016 EPA took the first steps in the process of developing emissions standards for existing sources in the oil and gas sector.
A few U.S. states have enacted or are considering legal measures to require the reduction of emissions of GHGs by companies and public utilities, primarily through the development of GHG emission inventories or regional GHG cap-and-trade programs. California has already enacted such a program and similar actions are being 


3

considered by Washington. The Company does not have any sites currently subject to California's GHG regulatory plan. There may be indirect impacts from changing input costs (such as electricity) at some of our California converting operations but these have yet to manifest themselves in material impacts. Although we are monitoring proposed programs in other states, it is unclear what impacts, if any, state-level GHG rules will have on the Company’s operations. 
Summary
Regulation of GHGs continues to evolve in various countries in which we do business. While it is likely that there will be increased governmental action regarding GHGs and climate change in the future, it is unclear when such actions will occur and at this time it is not reasonably possible to estimate Company costs of compliance with rules that have not yet been adopted or implemented and may not be adopted or implemented in the future. In addition to possible direct impacts, future legislation and regulation could have indirect impacts on International Paper, such as higher prices for transportation, energy and other inputs, as well as more protracted air permitting processes, causing delays and higher costs to implement capital projects. International Paper has controls and procedures in place to stay informed about developments concerning possible climate change legislation and regulation in the U.S. and in other countries where we operate. We regularly assess whether such legislation or regulation may have a material effect on the Company, its operations or financial condition, and whether we have any related disclosure obligations.
International Paper plays a significant role in responding to the climate change challenge. Our entire business depends upon the sustainability of forests. We transform renewable resources into recyclable products that people depend on every day. This cycle begins with sourcing renewable fiber from responsibly managed forests, and at the end of use our products are recycled into new products at a higher rate than any other base material. We will continue to lead the world in responsible forest stewardship to ensure healthy and productive forest ecosystems for generations to come. Our efforts to advance sustainable forest management and restore forest landscapes are an important lever for mitigating climate change through carbon storage in forests. Furthermore, we use biomass and manufacturing residuals (rather than fossil fuels) to generate a substantial majority of the manufacturing energy at our mills.
Additional information regarding climate change and International Paper is available in our 2017 Global Citizenship report found on our website at www.internationalpaper.com, though this information is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K and 


should not be considered part of this or any other report that we file with or furnish to the SEC.
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2018, we have approximately 53,000 employees, nearly 33,000 of whom are located in the United States. Of our U.S. employees, approximately 23,000 are hourly, with unions representing approximately 14,000 employees. Approximately 11,000 of this number are represented by the United Steelworkers union (USW).
International Paper, the USW, and several other unions have entered into two master agreements covering various mills and converting facilities. These master agreements cover several specific items, including wages, select benefit programs, successorship, employment security, and health and safety.  Individual facilities continue to have local agreements for other subjects not covered by the master agreements.  If local facility agreements are not successfully negotiated at the time of expiration, under the terms of the master agreements the local contracts will automatically renew with the same terms in effect. The master agreements cover the majority of our union represented mills and converting facilities. In addition, International Paper is party to a master agreement with District Council 2, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, covering additional converting facilities.
