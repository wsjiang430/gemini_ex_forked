Item 1.    Business.
Overview
Wheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. (the “Trust” or “REIT” or “Company”) is a Maryland corporation formed on June 23, 2011. The Trust serves as the general partner of Wheeler REIT, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership”) which was formed as a Virginia limited partnership on April 5, 2012. Substantially, all of our assets are held by, and all of our operations are conducted through, our Operating Partnership. The Company is a fully-integrated, self-managed commercial real estate investment company that shifted focus in 2018 after the JANAF acquisition from acquiring and managing to owning, leasing and operating income-producing retail properties with a primary focus on grocery-anchored centers.
Our corporate office is located at 2529 Virginia Beach Boulevard, Virginia Beach, Virginia 23452. Our telephone number is (757) 627-9088.
Portfolio
Our portfolio contains well-located, potentially dominant retail properties in secondary and tertiary markets, with a particular emphasis on grocery-anchored retail centers. Our properties are in communities that have stable demographics and have historically exhibited favorable trends, such as strong population and income growth. We generally lease our properties to national and regional retailers that offer consumer goods and generate regular consumer traffic. We believe our tenants carry goods that are less impacted by fluctuations in the broader U.S. economy and consumers’ disposable income, generating more predictable property level cash flows.
The Company’s portfolio of properties is dependent upon regional and local economic conditions. As of December 31, 2018, we own a portfolio consisting of seventy-one properties, including sixty-four retail shopping centers, totaling 5,716,471 total leasable square feet of which is 89.4% leased (our "operating portfolio"), one office property and six undeveloped land parcels totaling approximately 65 acres. The properties are geographically concentrated in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast and Midwest, which markets represented approximately 4%, 19%, 76% and 1%, respectively, of the total annualized base rent of the properties in its portfolio as of December 31, 2018.
No tenant represents greater than 10% of the Company’s annualized base rent or % of gross leasable square footage.  The top 10 tenants account for 24.59% or $12.11 million of annualized base rent and 29.32% or 1.68 million of gross leasable square footage at December 31, 2018.
Management Team and People
We have 50 full-time employees. Our management team has experience and capabilities across the real estate sector with experience in all aspects of the commercial real estate industry, specifically in our target/existing markets. David Kelly has served as Chief Executive Officer (the "CEO") since January 2018 and Matthew Reddy as CFO since February 2018. David Kelly, our CEO previously served as the Chief Investment Officer (the "CIO"). He has over twenty-seven years of experience in the real estate industry. Prior to joining us, he served for thirteen years as the Director of Real Estate for Supevalu, Inc., a Fortune 100 supermarket retailer. While at Supervalu, he focused on site selection and acquisitions from New England to the Carolinas, completing transactions totaling over $500 million. Matthew Reddy our CFO is a certified public accountant and has

been with the Company since June 2015 as Chief Accounting Officer. Prior to joining Wheeler, Mr. Reddy was the Assistant Vice President of Online Products at Liberty Tax Service. While employed at Liberty, Mr. Reddy was also employed as Director of Finance from 2011 to 2014, and Manager of Financial Reporting from 2008 to 2011. Prior to joining Liberty, Mr. Reddy worked at KPMG LLP as a Senior Auditor. Andrew Franklin is our Chief Operating Officer and has over eighteen years of commercial real estate experience. Mr. Franklin is responsible for overseeing the property management, lease administration and leasing divisions of our growing portfolio of commercial assets. Prior to joining us, Mr. Franklin was a partner with Broad Reach Retail Partners where he ran the day to day operations of the company, managing the leasing team as well as overseeing the asset, property and construction management of the portfolio with assets totaling $50 million. Mr. Franklin is a graduate of the University of Maryland, with a Bachelor of Science degree in Finance.
Business Objectives and Investment Strategy
Our primary business objective is to provide attractive risk adjusted returns to our shareholders by increasing cash flows. We intend to achieve this objective utilizing the following investment strategy:

• | Focus on necessity-based retail. Own and operate retail properties that serve the essential day-to-day shopping needs of the surrounding communities. These necessity-based centers attract high levels of daily traffic resulting in cross-selling of goods and services from our tenants. The majority of our tenants provide non-cyclical consumer goods and services that are less impacted by fluctuations in the economy. According to Statista, the average consumer in the US makes a trip to a grocery store 1.6 times per week. We believe these centers that provide essential goods and services such as groceries results in a stable, lower-risk portfolio of retail investment properties.


• | Focus on secondary and tertiary markets with strong demographics and demand. Our properties are in markets that have limited competition from institutional buyers and relatively low levels of new construction. The markets have strong demographics such as population density, population growth, tenant sales trends and growth in household income. We seek to identify new tenants and renew leases with existing tenants in these locations that support the need for necessity-based retail and limited new supply.


• | Increase operating income through leasing strategies and expense management. We employ intensive lease management strategies to optimize occupancy. Management has strong expertise in acquiring and managing under-performing properties and increasing operating income through more effective leasing strategies and expense management such as common area maintenance ("CAM"), or CAM reimbursement and experience utilizing exterior parking for build to suit outparcels or pad sales. Our leases generally require the tenant to reimburse us for a substantial portion of the expenses incurred in operating, maintaining, repairing, and managing the shopping center and the common areas, along with the associated insurance costs and real estate taxes. Operating expenses that qualify for CAM reimbursement include, but are not limited to, landscaping, parking field maintenance and repairs, building maintenance and repairs, utilities and their associated maintenance and repair within the shopping center. The amount that each tenant pays is determined on a pro-rata basis as defined in our lease and our leases generally allow us to add an administrative fee of 15%. Some leases are structured such that they include a cap on paying CAM and additional fees and charges. Additionally, in some cases the tenant is either fully or partially responsible for all maintenance of the property, thereby limiting our financial exposure towards maintaining the center and increasing our net income. We refer to this arrangement as a “triple net lease.” 


• | Selectively utilize our capital to improve retail properties. We intend to make capital investments where the return on such capital is accretive to our shareholders. We have significant expertise allocating capital to value-added improvements of retail properties to increase rents, extend long-term leases with anchor tenants and increasing occupancy. We will selectively allocate capital to revenue enhancing projects that we believe will improve the market position of a given property. 


• | Recycling and sensible management of capital structure. We intend to sell non-income producing land parcels utilizing sales proceeds to deleverage the balance sheet. In addition, we intend to monetize core-assets to redeploy the capital to further deleverage and strengthen the balance sheet. In 2018, we sold 4 properties for a total of $6.28 million net proceeds which were used to deleverage the balance sheet. Additional properties have been slated for disposition based upon management’s periodic review of our portfolio, and the determination by our Board of Directors that such activity would be in our best interest.

Policies With Respect to Certain Activities

The following is a discussion of certain activities of our investment, financing and other policies. These policies have been determined by our Board of Directors and, in general, may be amended or revised from time to time by our Board of Directors without a vote of our stockholders.
Investment Policies
Investments in Real Estate or Interests in Real Estate
We will conduct all of our investment activities through our Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. Our investment objectives are to maximize the cash flow of our properties, provide cash distributions and achieve long-term capital appreciation for our stockholders through increases in the value of our company. Our Operating Partnership intends to hold its properties for investment with a view to long-term appreciation and ownership. Occasional sales of the properties will be made consistent with our investment strategy. We have not established a specific policy regarding the relative priority of these investment objectives.
We expect to pursue our investment objectives primarily through the ownership by our Operating Partnership of our portfolio of properties and assets. We currently intend to invest primarily in retail properties. Future investment or development activities will not be limited to any geographic area, property type or to a specified percentage of our assets. While we may diversify in terms of property locations, size and market, we do not have any limit on the amount or percentage of our assets that may be invested in any one property or any one geographic area. We intend to engage in such future investment activities in a manner that is consistent with the maintenance of our status as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, we may lease income-producing properties for long-term investment, expand and improve the properties we presently own, or sell such properties, in whole or in part, when circumstances warrant.
We may also participate with third parties in property ownership, through joint ventures or other types of co-ownership. We also may acquire real estate or interests in real estate in exchange for the issuance of Common Stock, common units in our Operating Partnership, Preferred Stock or options to purchase stock. These types of investments may permit us to own interests in larger assets without unduly restricting our diversification and, therefore, provide us with flexibility in structuring our portfolio. We will not, however, enter into a joint venture or other partnership arrangement to make an investment that would not otherwise meet our investment policies.
Equity investments in acquired properties may be subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness or to new indebtedness which may be incurred in connection with acquiring or refinancing these properties. Debt service on such financing or indebtedness will have a priority over any dividends with respect to our Common Stock. Investments are also subject to our policy not to fall within the definition of an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”).
Securities of or Interests in Persons Primarily Engaged in Real Estate Activities and Other Issuers

Although not presently contemplated, subject to the percentage of ownership limitations and the income and asset tests necessary for REIT qualification, we may in the future invest in securities of other REITs, other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers where such investment would be consistent with our investment objectives. We may invest in the debt or equity securities of such entities, including for the purpose of exercising control over such entities. We have no current plans to invest in entities that are not engaged in real estate activities. While we may attempt to diversify our investments with respect to the retail properties owned by such entities, in terms of property locations, size and market, we do not have any limit on the amount or percentage of our assets that may be invested in any one entity, property or geographic area. Our investment objectives are to maximize cash flow of our investments and provide cash distributions and long-term capital appreciation to our stockholders through increases in the value of our company. We have not established a specific policy regarding the relative priority of these investment objectives. We will not underwrite the securities of any other issuers and will limit our investment in such securities so that we will not fall within the definition of an “investment company” under the 1940 Act.

Investments in Other Securities

Other than as described above, we do not currently intend to invest in any additional securities such as bonds, Preferred Stock or Common Stock, although we reserve the right to do so if our Board of Directors determines that such action would be in our best interests.
Financings and Leverage Policy

In the future, we anticipate using a number of different sources to finance our operations, including cash flows from operations, asset sales, seller financing, issuance of debt securities, private financings (such as additional bank credit facilities, which may or may not be secured by our assets), property-level mortgage debt, common or preferred equity issuances or any combination of these sources, to the extent available to us, or other sources that may become available from time to time. Any debt that we incur may be recourse or non-recourse and may be secured or unsecured. We also may take advantage of joint venture or other partnering opportunities as such opportunities arise in order to acquire properties that would otherwise be unavailable to us. We may use the proceeds of our borrowings to refinance existing debt or for general corporate purposes.
Although we are not required by our governing documents to maintain a ratio of debt to total market capitalization at any particular level, our Board of Directors will review our ratio of debt to total capital on a quarterly basis, with the goal of maintaining a reasonable rate consistent with our expected ratio of debt to total market capitalization going forward. Additionally, we intend, when appropriate, to employ prudent amounts of leverage and to use debt as a means of providing additional funds to refinance existing debt or for general corporate purposes. We expect to use leverage conservatively, assessing the appropriateness of new equity or debt capital based on market conditions, including prudent assumptions regarding future cash flow, the creditworthiness of tenants and future rental rates. Our charter and bylaws do not limit the amount of debt that we may incur. Our Board of Directors has not adopted a policy limiting the total amount of debt that we may incur.
Our Board of Directors will consider a number of factors in evaluating the amount of debt that we may incur. If we adopt a debt policy, our Board of Directors may from time to time modify such policy in light of then-current economic conditions, relative costs of debt and equity capital, market values of our properties, general conditions in the market for debt and equity securities, fluctuations in the market price of our Common Stock, growth opportunities and other factors. Our decision to use leverage in the future to finance our assets will be at our discretion and will not be subject to the approval of our stockholders, and we are not restricted by our governing documents or otherwise in the amount of leverage that we may use.
Lending Policies
In 2016, we loaned $11.0 million to a related party for the partial funding of the Sea Turtle Development project in Hilton Head, South Carolina and $1.0 million note receivable in consideration for the sale of a land parcel owned by the Company. The Company recognized $1.74 million and $5.26 million impairment charges on the note receivable during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. At December 31, 2018 the carrying value of the note receivable was $5.00 million. We do not have a policy limiting our ability to make loans to other persons. We may consider offering purchase money financing in connection with the sale of properties where the provision of that financing will increase the value to be received by us for the property sold. We also may make loans to joint ventures in which we participate. However, we do not intend to engage in significant lending activities. Any loan we make will be consistent with maintaining our status as a REIT.
Equity Capital Policies
To the extent that our Board of Directors approve additional capital raises, we may issue debt or equity securities, including additional units or senior securities of our Operating Partnership, retain earnings (subject to provisions in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") requiring distributions of income to maintain REIT qualification) or pursue a combination of these methods. As long as our Operating Partnership is in existence, we will generally contribute the proceeds of all equity capital raised by us to our Operating Partnership in exchange for additional interests in our Operating Partnership, which will dilute the ownership interests of the limited partners in our Operating Partnership.
Existing stockholders will have no preemptive rights to Common or Preferred Stock or units issued in any securities offering by us, and any such offering might cause a dilution of a stockholder’s investment in us. Although we have no current plans to do so, we may in the future issue shares of Common Stock or units in connection with acquisitions of property.
5

We may, under certain circumstances, purchase shares of our Common Stock or other securities in the open market or in private transactions with our stockholders, provided that those purchases are approved by our Board of Directors. Any repurchase of shares of our Common Stock or other securities, would only be taken in conformity with applicable federal and state laws and the applicable requirements for qualification as a REIT.
Change in Investment and Financing Objectives and Policies

Our investment policies and objectives and the methods of implementing our investment objectives and policies, except to the extent set forth in our charter, may be altered by our Board of Directors, without the approval of our stockholders. If we change these policies, we will disclose these changes prior to the effective time of these changes. If we change these policies after the offering, we will inform our stockholders of the change within ten days after our Board of Directors alters our investment objectives and policies, by either a press release or notice of an “other event” on a Current Report on Form 8-K or another method deemed reasonable by our Board of Directors.
Conflict of Interest Policies

Overview. Conflicts of interest could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates, on the one hand, and our Operating Partnership or any partner thereof, on the other. Our directors and officers have duties to our company under applicable Maryland law in connection with their management of our company. At the same time, we, as the general partner of our Operating Partnership, have fiduciary duties and obligations to our Operating Partnership and its other partners under Virginia law and the partnership agreement of our Operating Partnership (the "Partnership Agreement") in connection with the management of our Operating Partnership. Our fiduciary duties and obligations, as the general partner of our Operating Partnership, may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to our company.
Under Virginia law (where our Operating Partnership is formed), a general partner of a Virginia limited partnership has fiduciary duties of loyalty and care to the partnership and its partners and must discharge its duties and exercise its rights as general partner under the Partnership Agreement or Virginia law consistently with the obligation of good faith and fair dealing. The duty of loyalty requires a general partner of a Virginia general partnership to account to the partnership and hold as trustee for it any property, profit, or benefit derived by the general partner in the conduct of the partnership business or derived from a use by the general partner of partnership property, including the appropriation of a partnership opportunity, to refrain from dealing with the partnership in the conduct of the partnership’s business as or on behalf of a party having an interest adverse to the partnership and to refrain from competing with the partnership in the conduct of the partnership business, although the Partnership Agreement may identify specific types or categories of activities that do not violate the duty of loyalty. The Partnership Agreement provides that, in the event of a conflict between the interests of our Operating Partnership or any partner, on the one hand, and the separate interests of our company or our stockholders, on the other hand, we, in our capacity as the general partner of our Operating Partnership, are under no obligation not to give priority to the separate interests of our company or our stockholders, and that any action or failure to act on our part or on the part of our directors that gives priority to the separate interests of our company or our stockholders that does not result in a violation of the contract rights of the limited partners of the Operating Partnership under its Partnership Agreement does not violate the duty of loyalty that we, in our capacity as the general partner of our Operating Partnership, owe to the Operating Partnership and its partners. The duty of care requires a general partner to refrain from engaging in grossly negligent or reckless conduct, intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, and this duty may not be unreasonably reduced by the Partnership Agreement.
The Partnership Agreement provides that we are not liable to our Operating Partnership or any partner for monetary damages for losses sustained, liabilities incurred or benefits not derived by our Operating Partnership or any limited partner, except for liability for our intentional harm or gross negligence. The Partnership Agreement also provides that any obligation or liability in our capacity as the general partner of our Operating Partnership that may arise at any time under the Partnership Agreement or any other instrument, transaction or undertaking contemplated by the Partnership Agreement will be satisfied, if at all, out of our assets or the assets of our Operating Partnership only, and no obligation or liability of the general partner will be personally binding upon any of our directors, stockholders, officers, employees or agents, regardless of whether such obligation or liability is in the nature of contract, tort or otherwise, and none of our directors or officers will be liable or accountable in damages or otherwise to the partnership, any partner or any assignee of a partner for losses sustained, liabilities incurred or benefits not derived as a result of errors in judgment or mistakes of fact or law or any act or omission. Our Operating Partnership must indemnify us, our directors and officers, officers of our Operating Partnership and any other person designated by us against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities (whether joint or several), expenses (including, without 
6

limitation, attorneys’ fees and other legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts arising from any and all claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, that relate to the operations of the Operating Partnership, unless (1) an act or omission of the person was material to the matter giving rise to the action and either was committed in bad faith or was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty, (2) for any transaction for which such person actually received an improper personal benefit in violation or breach of any provision of the Partnership Agreement, or (3) in the case of a criminal proceeding, the person had reasonable cause to believe the act or omission was unlawful.
Our Operating Partnership must also pay or reimburse the reasonable expenses of any such person upon its receipt of a written affirmation of the person’s good faith belief that the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification has been met and a written undertaking to repay any amounts paid or advanced if it is ultimately determined that the person did not meet the standard of conduct for indemnification. Our Operating Partnership will not indemnify or advance funds to any person with respect to any action initiated by the person seeking indemnification without our approval (except for any proceeding brought to enforce such person’s right to indemnification under the Partnership Agreement) or if the person is found to be liable to our Operating Partnership on any portion of any claim in the action.
No reported decision of a Virginia appellate court has interpreted provisions similar to the provisions of the Partnership Agreement of our Operating Partnership that modify or reduce the fiduciary duties and obligations of a general partner or reduce or eliminate our liability for money damages to the Operating Partnership and its partners, and we have not obtained an opinion of counsel as to the enforceability of the provisions set forth in the Partnership Agreement that purport to modify or reduce our fiduciary duties that would be in effect were it not for the Partnership Agreement.
Sale or Refinancing of Properties. Upon the sale of certain of the properties by us, certain unitholders could incur adverse tax consequences which are different from the tax consequences to us and to holders of our Common Stock. Consequently, unitholders may have differing objectives regarding the appropriate pricing and timing of any such sale or repayment of indebtedness.
While we will have the exclusive authority under the Partnership Agreement to determine whether, when, and on what terms to sell a property or when to refinance or repay indebtedness, any such decision would require the approval of our Board of Directors.
Policies Applicable to All Directors and Officers. Our charter and bylaws do not restrict any of our directors, officers, stockholders or affiliates from having a pecuniary interest in an investment or transaction that we have an interest in or from conducting, for their own account, business activities of the type we conduct. We intend, however, to adopt policies that are designed to eliminate or minimize potential conflicts of interest, including a policy for the review, approval or ratification of any related party transactions. This policy will provide that the audit committee of our Board of Directors will review the relevant facts and circumstances of each related party transaction, including if the transaction is on terms comparable to those that could be obtained in arm’s length dealings with an unrelated third party before approving such transaction. We have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics, which provides that all of our directors, officers and employees are prohibited from taking for themselves opportunities that are discovered through the use of corporate property, information or position without our consent. However, we cannot assure you that these policies or provisions of law will always be successful in eliminating the influence of such conflicts, and if they are not successful, decisions could be made that might fail to reflect fully the interests of all stockholders.
Interested Director and Officer Transactions

Pursuant to the Maryland General Corporation Law (“MGCL”), a contract or other transaction between us and a director or between us and any other corporation or other entity in which any of our directors is a director or has a material financial interest is not void or voidable solely on the grounds of such common directorship or interest, the presence of such director at the meeting at which the contract or transaction is authorized, approved or ratified or the counting of the director’s vote in favor thereof, provided that:

• | the fact of the common directorship or interest is disclosed or known to our Board of Directors or a committee of our board, and our board or such committee authorizes, approves or ratifies the transaction or contract by the affirmative vote of a majority of disinterested directors, even if the disinterested directors constitute less than a quorum;

7


• | the fact of the common directorship or interest is disclosed or known to our stockholders entitled to vote thereon, and the transaction or contract is authorized, approved or ratified by a majority of the votes cast by the stockholders entitled to vote other than the votes of shares owned of record or beneficially by the interested director or corporation, firm or other entity; or


• | the transaction or contract is fair and reasonable to us at the time it is authorized, ratified or approved.

Furthermore, under Virginia law, we, as general partner, have a fiduciary duty of loyalty to our Operating Partnership and its partners and, consequently, such transactions also are subject to the duties that we, as general partner, owe to the Operating Partnership and its limited partners (as such duty has been modified by the Partnership Agreement). We have adopted a policy that requires that all contracts and transactions between us, our Operating Partnership or any of our subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of our directors or executive officers or any entity in which such director or executive officer is a director or has a material financial interest, on the other hand, must be approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of our disinterested directors even if less than a quorum. Where appropriate, in the judgment of the disinterested directors, our Board of Directors may obtain a fairness opinion or engage independent counsel to represent the interests of non-affiliated security holders, although our Board of Directors will have no obligation to do so.
Policies With Respect To Other Activities
We have authority to offer Common Stock, Preferred Stock or options to purchase stock in exchange for property and to repurchase or otherwise acquire our Common Stock or other securities in the open market or otherwise, and we may engage in such activities in the future. We expect, but are not obligated, to issue Common Stock to holders of common units upon exercise of their redemption rights. Our Board of Directors has the authority, without further stockholder approval, to amend our charter to increase or decrease the number of authorized shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock and authorize us to issue additional shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, in one or more series, including senior securities, in any manner, and on the terms and for the consideration, it deems appropriate. We have not engaged in trading, underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of other issuers other than our Operating Partnership and do not intend to do so. At all times, we intend to make investments in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT, unless because of circumstances or changes in the Code, or the Treasury regulations, our Board of Directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to qualify as a REIT. In addition, we intend to make investments in such a way that we will not be treated as an "investment company" under the 1940 Act.
Governmental Regulations Affecting Our Properties
We and our properties are subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental, health, safety and similar laws.
The application of these laws to a specific property that we own depends on a variety of property-specific circumstances, including the current and former uses of the property, the building materials used at the property and the physical layout of the property. Neither existing environmental, health, safety and similar laws nor the costs of our compliance with these laws has had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, and management does not believe they will in the future. In addition, we have not incurred, and do not expect to incur, any material costs or liabilities due to environmental contamination at properties we currently own or have owned in the past. However, we cannot predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations on properties we currently own or may acquire in the future. We have no current plans for substantial capital expenditures with respect to compliance with environmental, health, safety and similar laws and we carry environmental insurance which covers a number of environmental risks for most of our properties.
Competition
Numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us with respect to the leasing of properties. Some of these competitors may possess greater capital resources than we do, although we do not believe that any single competitor or group of competitors in any of the primary markets where our properties are located are dominant in that market. This competition may interfere with our ability to attract and retain tenants, leading to increased vacancy rates and/or reduced rents and adversely affect our ability to minimize operating expenses.
Retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from online retailers, outlet stores, discount shopping clubs, superstores, and other forms of sales and marketing of goods and services, such as direct mail. This competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants.
