Item 1.  Business.
 
Business of the Company
 
The Company is engaged in the business of investing in used regional aircraft equipment and leasing it to foreign and domestic regional air carriers.  The Company’s aircraft portfolio consists of 17 aircraft and one engine held for lease as of December 31, 2018, most of which are mid-life regional aircraft, and its globally diverse customer base consists of eleven airlines operating in nine countries. 
 
On October 1, 2018, AeroCentury acquired JHC in a reverse triangular merger (“Merger”) for consideration of approximately $2.9 million in cash and 129,217 shares of common stock.  JHC is the sole shareholder of JMC, which is an integrated aircraft management, marketing and financing business that manages and administers the Company's portfolio of aircraft assets.  Before the Merger, such management and administration were performed pursuant to the terms of a management agreement (the "Management Agreement") between the Company and JMC.  Post-Merger, the management and administration services provided under the Management Agreement have become internalized and under the control and management of the Company itself.
 
The Company’s principal business objective is to acquire aircraft assets and manage those assets in order to provide a return on investment through lease revenue and, eventually, sale proceeds.  The Company strives to achieve this objective by reinvesting cash flow from operations and using short-term and long-term debt and/or equity financing.  
 
The Company believes its ability to achieve this objective depends in large part on its success in three areas: asset selection and acquisition, lessee selection and obtaining financing to acquire aircraft and engines.
 
Asset Selection and Acquisition. The Company typically acquires assets in one of three ways.  The Company may purchase an asset already subject to a lease and assume the rights and obligations of the seller, as lessor under the existing lease.  Additionally, the Company may purchase an asset from an air carrier and lease it back to the air carrier.  Finally, the Company may purchase an asset from a seller and then immediately enter into a new lease for the aircraft with a third -party lessee.  In this last case, the Company typically does not purchase an asset unless a potential lessee has been identified and has committed to lease the asset.
 
The Company locates customers through marketing efforts utilizing website listings, attendance and sponsorship of industry conferences, referrals from existing industry contacts and current customers, and focused advertising.
 
The Company generally targets used regional aircraft with purchase prices between $10 million and $20 million and lease terms of three to ten years.  In identifying and selecting assets for acquisition, the Company evaluates, among other things, the type of asset, its current price and projected future value, its versatility or specialized uses, the current and projected availability of and demand for that asset, and the type and number of future potential lessees.  Because the Company has extensive experience in purchasing, leasing and selling used regional aircraft,  it believes it has the expertise and industry knowledge to purchase these assets at appropriate prices and maintain an acceptable overall on-lease rate for them. 
 
In order to improve the remarketability of an aircraft after expiration of a lease, the Company’s leases generally contain provisions that require lessees to either return the aircraft in a condition that allows the Company to expediently re-lease or sell the aircraft, or pay sufficient amounts based on usage under the lease to cover any maintenance or overhaul of the aircraft required to bring the aircraft to such a state.
 
Lessee Selection.  The Company’s customer base primarily consists of regional commercial aircraft operators located in globally diverse markets and seeking to access aircraft under operating leases.  The Company expects to continue to target these customer markets for the foreseeable future, and expects any customer growth in the near term would be from lessees operating outside of North America.  When considering whether to enter into transactions with a lessee, the Company generally reviews the lessee’s creditworthiness, growth prospects, financial status and backing; the experience of its management; and the impact of legal and regulatory matters in the lessee’s market, all of which are weighed in determining the lease terms offered to the lessee. In addition, it is the Company’s policy to monitor the lessee’s business and financial performance closely throughout the term of the lease, and, if requested, provide assistance drawn from the experience of the Company’s management in many areas of the air carrier industry.  Because of its “hands-on” approach to portfolio management, the Company believes it is able to enter into transactions with lessees in a wider range of markets than may be possible for traditional, large lending institutions and leasing companies.
 
Availability of Financing.  The Company has funded its asset acquisitions primarily through debt financing, supplemented by free cash flow.  The Company’s primary source of debt financing has been the Credit Facility, which is a secured credit facility provided by a syndicate of banks that was extended in February 2019 to expire in February 2023. In addition, during 2016, the Company financed the purchase of two aircraft using special purpose subsidiary financing, and in February 2019, the Company refinanced those two aircraft and four other aircraft assets that previously served as collateral under the Credit Facility using financing under new non-recourse Term Loans.
 
The Company’s portfolio of assets has historically generated lease and sale revenues that have exceeded the Company’s cash expenses, which have consisted mainly of maintenance costs, principal and interest payments on debt, professional fees, insurance premiums, management fees (before the Merger) and salaries and employee benefits (after the Merger). This historical excess cash from operations has aided in the Company’s ability to continue to add to its aircraft portfolio over time; however, the Company’s performance and cash flow are subject to fluctuations and a number of risks and uncertainties, and as a result, free cash flow may not serve as a viable source of funding in some periods. See Item 7 of this report for more information about trends in and expectations about the Company’s performance and liquidity.

Competition 
 
The Company competes with other leasing companies, banks, financial institutions, private equity firms, aircraft leasing syndicates, aircraft manufacturers, distributors, airlines and aircraft operators, equipment managers, equipment leasing programs and other parties for its regional air carrier customers.  Many of these competitors have longer operating histories, more experience, larger customer bases, more expansive brand recognition, deeper market penetration and significantly greater financial resources.  Competition has increased significantly recently as competitors who have traditionally neglected the regional air carrier market have recently focused on this market.  The industry has also experienced a number of consolidations of smaller leasing companies, creating a handful of very large companies operating in this market, as well as new entrants to the market.
 
Competition in this industry is based on a number of factors, including price, lease terms, variety of product selection (in other words, the type(s) of aircraft available for lease), reputation, ability to execute transactions as committed, and customer service.  Among these, the Company believes price and lease terms may be the most important competitive factors, and as a result, the entry of new competitors into the market, the creation of larger competitors due to consolidation, and/or the entry of traditional large aircraft lessors into the regional aircraft niche, particularly those with greater access to capital than the Company, could lead to fewer acquisition opportunities for the Company and/or lease terms that are less favorable to the Company, as well as fewer renewals of existing leases or new leases of existing aircraft.
 
The Company, however, believes that it has a competitive advantage due to its experience and operational efficiency in financing the transaction sizes that are desired by many in the regional air carrier market.
 
Dependence on Significant Customers
 
For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company’s four largest customers accounted for 30%, 21%, 15%, and 13% of operating lease revenue.  For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company’s four largest customers accounted for 28%, 20%, 14%, and 11% of operating lease revenue.  This concentration of credit risk with respect to lease receivables will diminish in the future only if the Company is able to expand its customer base by re-leasing assets currently on lease to significant customers to new customers at lease-end and/or acquiring assets for lease to new customers.
Environmental Matters
 
Compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws, including provisions regulating the discharge of greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide (CO2)) into the environment, aircraft noise regulations, and remedial agreements or other actions relating to these provisions or the environment otherwise, has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on the Company’s capital expenditures, financial condition, results of operations or competitive position.

Employees
 
Prior to the Merger, JMC was responsible for all administration and management of the Company pursuant to the terms of the Management Agreement.  Consequently, the Company did not have any employees.  With the acquisition of JHC by the Company on October 1, 2018, the Company assumed the role of employer (through its JMC subsidiary) of the staff of such subsidiary at the time of the Merger.  As a result, as of December 31, 2018, the Company had 12 total employees, including 11 full-time employees.

The Company has a registered trademark for the “AeroCentury” name.  The Company relies primarily on trademark and trade secrets law, as well as non-disclosure contracts, to protect its intellectual property and proprietary information.
