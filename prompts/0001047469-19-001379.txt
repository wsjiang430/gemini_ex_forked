     Item 1.    Business 
  Introduction 
         ECA Marcellus Trust I is a statutory trust formed in March 2010 under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, pursuant to a Trust Agreement, as amended and restated (the "Trust Agreement"), among Energy Corporation of America ("Legacy ECA"), as Trustor, The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (the "Trustee"), and Wilmington Trust Company, as Delaware Trustee (the "Delaware Trustee"). The Trust maintains its offices at the office of the Trustee, at 601 Travis Street, 16th Floor, Houston Texas 77002. The telephone number of the Trustee is 1-512-236-6555. 
         In November 2017, Greylock Energy, LLC and certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries ("Greylock Energy"), including Greylock Production, LLC ("Greylock Production"), which serves as operator of the subject wells, and Greylock Midstream, LLC ("Greylock Midstream"), whose subsidiaries market and gather certain of the gas, acquired substantially all of the gas production and midstream assets of Legacy ECA, including all of Legacy ECA's interests in certain natural gas properties that are subject to royalty interests held by the Trust (the "Acquisition"). 
         In connection with the Acquisition, Greylock Production assumed all of Legacy ECA's obligations under the Trust Agreement and other instruments to which Legacy ECA and the Trustee were parties, including (1) the Administrative Services Agreement by and among Legacy ECA, the Trust and the Trustee dated July 7, 2010, and (2) a letter agreement between Legacy ECA and the Trustee regarding certain loans to be made by Legacy ECA to the Trust as necessary to enable the Trust to pay its liabilities as they become due (the "Letter Agreement"). In addition, Legacy ECA, Greylock Production, and the Trustee entered into a Reaffirmation and Amendment of Mortgage, Assignment of Leases, Security Agreement, Fixture Filing and Financing Statement (the "Reaffirmation Agreement"), pursuant to which, among other things, Greylock Production (1) reaffirmed the liens and the security interest granted pursuant to the existing mortgage securing the interests in the subject properties, as well as the mortgage and the obligations of Legacy ECA under the mortgage, and (2) assumed the obligations of Legacy ECA under the Letter Agreement. 
         The Trust makes copies of its reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), available at www.businesswire.com/cnn/ect.htm. The Trust's filings under the Exchange Act are also available electronically from the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. The Trust will also provide electronic and paper copies of its filings free of charge upon request to the Trustee. 
   General 
         The Trust does not conduct any operations or activities. The Trust's purpose is, in general, to hold the Royalty Interests (described below), to distribute to the Trust unitholders cash that the Trust receives in respect of the Royalty Interests after the payment of Trust expenses, and to perform certain administrative functions in respect of the Royalty Interests and the Trust units. The Trustee has no authority or responsibility for, and no involvement with, any aspect of the oil and gas operations on the properties to which the Royalty Interests relate. The Trust derives all or substantially all of its income and cash flows from the Royalty Interests. The Trust is treated as a partnership for federal and state income tax purposes. 
         Initially, the Trust owned royalty interests in the 14 Producing Wells described in the Prospectus (the "Producing Wells") and royalty interests in 52 horizontal natural gas development wells to be drilled to the Marcellus Shale formation (the "PUD Wells") within the AMI, in which Legacy ECA held approximately 9,300 acres, of which it owned substantially all of the working interests, in Greene 
 7

   County, Pennsylvania. The AMI consisted of the Marcellus Shale formation in approximately 121 square miles in Greene County, Pennsylvania. 
         Legacy ECA completed its drilling obligation to the Trust under the Development Agreement as of November 30, 2011, approximately 2.3 years in advance of the required completion date of March 31, 2014. Consequently, no additional wells have been or will be drilled for the Trust. As of December 31, 2018 the Trust owns Royalty Interests in the 14 Producing Wells and the 40 development wells (52.06 Equivalent PUD Wells) that are now completed and in production. The 14 Producing Wells and the 40 development wells (52.06 Equivalent PUD Wells) are sometimes herein called the "Trust Wells". 
         The royalty interests were conveyed from Legacy ECA's working interest in the Producing Wells and the PUD Wells limited to the Marcellus Shale formation (the "Underlying Properties"). The royalty interest in the Producing Wells (the "PDP Royalty Interest") entitles the Trust to receive 90% of the proceeds (exclusive of any production or development costs but after deducting post-production costs and any applicable taxes) from the sale of production of natural gas attributable to Legacy ECA's interest in the Producing Wells for a period of 20 years commencing on April 1, 2010 and 45% thereafter. The royalty interest in the PUD Wells (the "PUD Royalty Interest" and together with the PDP Royalty Interest, the "Royalty Interests") entitles the Trust to receive 50% of the proceeds (exclusive of any production or development costs but after deducting post-production costs and any applicable taxes) from the sale of production of natural gas attributable to Legacy ECA's interest in the PUD Wells for a period of 20 years commencing on April 1, 2010 and 25% thereafter. As used herein, the term "Producing Wells" means the 14 Producing Wells as defined above, and does not include the 40 PUD Wells, although they also have been completed and are producing. 
         Legacy ECA was obligated to drill all of the PUD Wells no later than March 31, 2014. As of November 30, 2011, Legacy ECA had fulfilled its drilling obligation to the Trust by drilling 40 PUD Wells (52.06 Equivalent PUD Wells), calculated as provided in the Development Agreement. The Trust was not responsible for any costs related to the drilling of development wells or any other development or operating costs. The Trust's cash receipts in respect of the Royalty Interests is determined after deducting post-production costs and any applicable taxes associated with the Royalty Interests, and the Trust's cash available for distribution includes any cash receipts from the hedge contracts and is reduced by Trust administrative expenses. Post-production costs generally consist of costs incurred to gather, compress, transport, process, treat, dehydrate and market the natural gas produced. Charges payable to Legacy ECA for such post-production costs on the related Greene County Gathering System (the "Post-Production Services Fee") were limited to $0.52 per MMBtu gathered until Legacy ECA fulfilled its drilling obligation in 2011; since then Legacy ECA was, and after the Acquisition Greylock Midstream is, permitted to increase the Post-Production Services Fee to the extent necessary to recover certain capital expenditures in the Greene County Gathering System ("GCGS"). 
         Generally, the percentage of production proceeds to be received by the Trust with respect to a well equals the product of (i) the percentage of proceeds to which the Trust is entitled under the terms of the conveyances (90% for the Producing Wells and 50% for the PUD Wells) multiplied by (ii) Legacy ECA's net revenue interest in the well. Legacy ECA on average owned an 81.53% net revenue interest in the Producing Wells. Therefore, the Trust was entitled to receive on average 73.37% of the proceeds of production from the Producing Wells. With respect to the PUD Wells, the conveyance related to the PUD Royalty Interest provides that the proceeds from the PUD Wells are calculated on the basis that the underlying PUD Wells are burdened only by interests that in total would not exceed 12.5% of the revenues from such properties, regardless of whether the royalty interest owners are actually entitled to a greater percentage of revenues from such properties. As an example, assuming Legacy ECA owns a 100% working interest in a PUD Well, the applicable net revenue interest is calculated by multiplying Legacy ECA's percentage working interest in the 100% working interest well by the unburdened interest percentage (87.5%) and such well would have a minimum 87.5% net revenue interest. Accordingly, the Trust is entitled to a minimum of 43.75% of the production proceeds from the well 
 8

   provided in this example. To the extent Legacy ECA's working interest in a PUD Well is less than 100%, the Trust's share of proceeds would be proportionately reduced. 
         As described under "Â—Duration of the Trust; Sale of Royalty Interests" below, the Trust is required to dissolve if the gross proceeds received by the Trust attributable to the Royalty Interests over any four consecutive quarters are less than $1.5 million. Gross proceeds over the four consecutive quarters ended December 31, 2018 were $6.9 million. 
   Historical Target Distributions 
         The Trust makes quarterly cash distributions of substantially all of its cash receipts, after deducting Trust administrative expenses, including the costs incurred as a result of being a publicly traded entity, on or about the 60th day following the completion of each quarter. Unless it is sooner liquidated, the Trust will liquidate on or about March 31, 2030. 
         The amount of Trust revenues and cash distributions to Trust unitholders depend on, among other things:
 

Â• natural gas prices received; 
Â• the volume and Btu rating of natural gas produced and sold; 
Â• post-production costs and any applicable taxes; 
Â• administrative expenses of the Trust including expenses incurred as a result of being a publicly traded entity, and any changes in amounts
reserved for such expenses; and 
Â• through March 31, 2014, the effects of the hedge arrangements. 

         The effective date of the Trust was April 1, 2010, meaning the Trust has received the proceeds of production attributable to the PDP Royalty Interest from that date even though the PDP Royalty Interest was not conveyed to the Trust until July 7, 2010. The amount of the quarterly distributions fluctuates from quarter to quarter, depending on the proceeds received by the Trust, among other factors. There is no minimum required distribution. 
         Pursuant to Section 1446 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "IRC"), withholding tax on income effectively connected to a United States trade or business allocated to non-U.S. persons ("ECI") should be made at the highest marginal rate. Under IRC Section 1441, withholding tax on fixed, determinable, annual, periodic income from United States sources allocated to non-U.S. persons should be made at 30% of gross income unless the rate is reduced by treaty. Nominees and brokers should withhold at the highest marginal rate on the distribution made to non-U.S. persons. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017 treats a non-U.S. holder's gain on the sale of Trust units as ECI to the extent such holder would have had ECI if the Trust had sold all of its assets at fair market value on the date of the exchange. The new legislation also requires the transferee of units to withhold 10% of the amount realized on the sale of exchange of units (generally, the purchase price) unless the transferor certifies that it is not a nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation. 
         The Trust makes quarterly cash distributions of substantially all of its cash receipts, after deducting Trust administrative expenses, including the costs incurred as a result of being a publicly traded entity, on or about the 60th day following the completion of each quarter. Unless sooner liquidated, as discussed in detail below under the caption "The Trustee may, under certain circumstances, sell the Royalty Interests and dissolve the Trust. Unless sooner terminated, the Trust will begin to terminate following the end of the 20 year period in which the Trust owns the Term Royalty Interests" in Item 1A. Risk Factors, the Trust will liquidate on or about March 31, 2030 (the "Termination Date"). At the Termination Date, 50% of each of the PDP Royalty Interest and the PUD Royalty Interest will revert automatically to Greylock Production. The remaining 50% of each of the PDP Royalty Interest 
 9

   and the PUD Royalty Interest will be sold, and the net proceeds will be distributed pro rata to the unitholders soon after the Termination Date. Greylock Production will have a right of first refusal to purchase the remaining 50% of the Royalty Interests at the Termination Date. Because payments to the Trust will be generated by depleting assets and the Trust has a finite life with the production from the Underlying Properties diminishing over time, a portion of each distribution will represent a return of the original investment in the Trust units. 
         The Trustee can authorize the Trust to borrow money to pay Trust administrative or incidental expenses that exceed cash held by the Trust. The Trustee may authorize the Trust to borrow from the Trustee as a lender provided the terms of the loan are fair to the Trust unitholders, although the Trustee does not intend to make any such loans. The Trustee may also deposit funds awaiting distribution in an account with itself, if the interest paid to the Trust at least equals amounts paid by the Trustee on similar deposits, and make other short term investments with the funds distributed to the Trust. The Trustee may also hold funds awaiting distribution in a non interest bearing account. 
         The Trust is responsible for paying all legal, accounting, tax advisory, engineering, printing costs and other administrative and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by or at the direction of the Trustee. The Trust is also responsible for paying other expenses, including the expenses of tax return and Schedule K-1 preparation and distribution, and expenses incurred as a result of being a publicly traded entity, including costs associated with annual and quarterly reports to unitholders, independent auditor fees and registrar and transfer agent fees. 
   The Administrative Services Agreement 
         The Trust is party to an Administrative Services Agreement ("ASA") with Greylock Production, which assumed Legacy ECA's obligations under the ASA subsequent to the Acquisition. The ASA obligates the Trust to pay Greylock Production an administrative services fee for accounting, bookkeeping and informational services to be performed by Greylock Production on behalf of the Trust relating to the Royalty Interests. The annual fee of $60,000 is payable in equal quarterly installments. Under certain circumstances, Greylock Production and the Trustee each may terminate the ASA at any time following delivery of notice no less than 90 days prior to the date of termination. 
 The Development Agreement 
         In connection with the formation of the Trust, the Trust and Legacy ECA entered into a Development Agreement that obligated Legacy ECA to drill all of the PUD Wells by March 31, 2014. Legacy ECA was obligated to bear all of the costs of drilling and completing the PUD Wells. Legacy ECA was required to complete and equip each development well that reasonably appeared to be capable of producing gas in quantities sufficient to pay completion, equipping and operating costs. Legacy ECA drilled, completed and equipped each of the development wells. 
         For purposes of Legacy ECA's drilling obligation, and subject to the following paragraph, Legacy ECA was credited with a full development well drilled if its working interest in the development well drilled was 100%. Where Legacy ECA's working interest in a development well drilled was less than 100%, Legacy ECA was credited with a portion of a development well in the proportion that its working interest in the development well bears to 100%. For example, if Legacy ECA's working interest in a development well drilled by Legacy ECA in connection with fulfilling its drilling obligation to the Trust was 50%, Legacy ECA was credited with one-half of a development well for purposes of satisfying its drilling obligation in the period the development well was drilled. 
         Wells drilled horizontally with a horizontal lateral distance (measured from the midpoint of the curve to the end of the lateral) of less than 2,500 feet counted as a Fractional well in proportion to total lateral length divided by 2,500 feet. Wells with a horizontal lateral distance of greater than 2,500 
 10

   feet (subject to a maximum of 3,500 feet) counted as one well plus a Fractional well equal to the length drilled in excess of 2,500 (up to 3,500 feet) feet divided by 2,500 feet. 
         In accordance with these provisions of the Development Agreement, Legacy ECA drilled 40 development wells (52.06 Equivalent PUD Wells) to fulfill its obligation to drill the 52 PUD Wells as required. 
         Legacy ECA and, following the Acquisition, Greylock Production agreed not to drill and complete, and not to permit any other person within its control to drill and complete, any well on the lease acreage that would have a perforated segment within 500 feet of any perforated interval of a PUD Well or Producing Well in the Marcellus Shale formation. 
   Marketing and Post-Production Services 
         Pursuant to the terms of the conveyances creating the Royalty Interests, Greylock Production has the responsibility to market, or cause to be marketed, the natural gas production related to the Underlying Properties. The terms of the conveyances creating the Royalty Interests do not permit Greylock Production to charge any marketing fee when determining the proceeds upon which the royalty payments are calculated. As a result, the proceeds to the Trust from the sales of natural gas production from the Underlying Properties are determined based on the same price (net of post-production costs) that Greylock Production receives for natural gas production attributable to Greylock Production's retained interest. 
         Greylock Midstream markets the majority of its operated production and markets all of the natural gas produced from the Underlying Properties. Greylock Midstream enters into gas sales arrangements with large aggregators of supply, and these arrangements may be on a month-to-month basis or may be for a term of up to one year or longer. The natural gas is sold at a market price and any applicable post-production costs are deducted. 
         All of the production from the Producing Wells and the PUD Wells is currently gathered by Greylock Midstream on the GCGS that it operates and owns an interest in. The Trust paid the initial Post-Production Services Fee of $0.52 per MMBtu for use of this system, including Greylock Midstream's costs to gather, compress, transport, process, treat, dehydrate and market the gas. Legacy ECA was, and after the Acquisition Greylock Midstream is, permitted to increase this fee to the extent necessary to recover certain capital expenditures on the GCGS made after the completion of the drilling period, provided the resulting charge does not exceed the prevailing charges in the area for similar services. This fee does not include the cost of fuel used in the compression process or equivalent electricity charges when electric compressors are used, firm transportation charges on interstate gas pipelines, or other third-party charges. The Trust's cash available for distribution is reduced by Greylock Midstream's deductions for these post-production services. 
         Greylock Midstream may enter into arrangements with third parties to provide gathering, transportation, processing and other reasonable post-production services, including transportation on downstream interstate pipelines. Such additional post-production costs will be expressed as either (1) a cost per MMBtu or Mcf or (2) a percentage of the gross production from a well. To the extent that post-production costs are expressed as a cost per MMBtu or Mcf, such costs may be deducted by the purchaser of the natural gas prior to payment being made to Greylock Production for such production. At other times, Greylock Midstream will make payments directly to the third parties providing such post-production services. In either instance, the Trust's cash available for distribution will be reduced by the costs paid by Greylock Midstream for such post-production services provided by third parties. If the post-production costs are expressed as a percentage of the gross production from a well, then the volume of production from that well actually available for sale is less than the applicable percentage charged, and as a result the reserves associated with that well that are attributable to the Royalty Interests are reduced accordingly. 
 11

           The post-production costs for the Trust's natural gas produced and sold averaged $0.65 per MMBtu and $0.69 per MMBtu for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Such costs may increase or decrease in the future. The post-production costs attributable to third party arrangements may be costs established by arms-length negotiations or pursuant to a state or federal regulatory proceeding. Greylock Production is permitted to deduct from the proceeds payable to the Trust other post-production costs necessary to make the natural gas from the Underlying Properties marketable, so long as such costs do not materially exceed the charges prevailing in the area for similar services. 
         Greylock Production has an agreement with Columbia Gas Transmission, LLC ("Columbia") to provide firm transportation downstream of the GCGS for 50,000 MMBtu per day. This firm transportation arrangement has been in effect since August 1, 2011 and is at Columbia's filed tariff rate, which is currently $0.2082 per MMBtu at one hundred percent load factor. Unless otherwise modified or altered, the agreement will terminate on July 31, 2021 with respect to 45,000 MMBtu per day, and on July 31, 2022 with respect to the remaining 5,000 MMBtu per day, unless Greylock Production exercises its right of first refusal to extend the term. Greylock Production has entered into an additional agreement with Columbia to provide firm transportation downstream of the GCGS for 100,000 MMBtu per day that will utilize Columbia's Mountaineer XPress Project. This firm transportation arrangement went into effect on January 18, 2019, and is at a fixed demand rate of $0.50 per MMBtu at one hundred percent load factor plus applicable Columbia tariff surcharges. Unless otherwise modified or altered, this agreement will terminate in January 2034. Firm transportation utilized as to the Trust's interests is a chargeable post-production cost, and the Trust bears its proportionate share of such costs. 
         Greylock Production may enter into similar gas supply arrangements and post-production service arrangements for the natural gas to be produced from the Underlying Properties. Any new gas supply arrangements or those entered into for providing post-production services, will be utilized in determining the proceeds for the Underlying Properties. 
   Competition and Markets 
         The natural gas industry is highly competitive. Greylock Production competes with major oil and gas companies and independent oil and gas companies for oil and gas leases, equipment, personnel and markets for the sale of natural gas. Many of these competitors are financially stronger than Greylock Production, but even financially troubled competitors can affect the market because they may need to sell natural gas regardless of price to attempt to maintain cash flow. The Trust is subject to the same competitive conditions as Greylock Production and other companies in the natural gas industry. 
         Natural gas competes with other forms of energy available to customers, primarily based on price. These alternate forms of energy include electricity, coal and fuel oils. Changes in the availability or price of natural gas or other forms of energy, as well as business conditions, conservation, legislation, regulations and the ability to convert to alternate fuels and other forms of energy may affect the demand for natural gas. 
         Future prices for natural gas will directly affect Trust distributions, estimates of reserves attributable to the Trust's interests, and estimated and actual future net revenues to the Trust. In view of the many uncertainties that affect the supply and demand for natural gas, neither the Trust nor Greylock Production can make reliable predictions of future gas supply or demand, future gas prices or the effect of future gas prices on the Trust. 
   Natural Gas Regulation 
         The availability, terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of natural gas. The interstate transportation and sale for resale of natural gas is subject to federal regulation, including 
 12

   regulation of the terms, conditions and rates for interstate transportation, storage and various other matters, primarily by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC"). Federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to natural gas pipeline transportation. The FERC's regulations for interstate natural gas transmission in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of natural gas. 
         Although natural gas prices are currently unregulated, Congress historically has been active in the area of natural gas regulation. Neither Greylock Production nor the Trust can predict whether new legislation to regulate natural gas prices might be proposed, what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures, and what effect, if any, the proposals might have on the operations of the Underlying Properties. Sales of condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at market prices. 
   Environmental Matters and Regulation 
         The exploration, development and production operations of Greylock Production are subject to comprehensive federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge, emission or release of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection or human health and safety. These laws and regulations may, among other things, require the acquisition of permits to conduct construction, drilling, water withdrawal and waste disposal operations; govern the amounts and types of substances that may be disposed, released or emitted into the environment; limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands, wilderness areas or areas containing endangered or threatened species or their habitats; require investigatory and remedial actions to mitigate pollution conditions arising from Greylock Production's operations or attributable to former operations; and impose obligations to reclaim and abandon well sites, impoundments and pits. Certain environmental statutes impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances have been disposed or otherwise released. The costs to comply with these laws, rules and regulations affect profitability. Moreover, compliance with these laws, rules and regulations may also restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise be possible. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations, or the issuance of orders enjoining some or all of Greylock Production's operations. 
         Changes in environmental regulation may place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, and thus, any future changes in environmental laws and regulations or re-interpretation of enforcement policies that result in more stringent or costly construction, drilling, water withdrawal, waste handling, storage, transport, disposal, or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on Greylock Production's capital expenditures, results of operations and financial position. Greylock Production may be unable to pass on increased compliance costs to its customers. Moreover, accidental loss of well control, or releases or spills may occur in the course of Greylock Production's operations, and Greylock Production could incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such incidents, including any third-party claims for damage to property and natural resources or personal injury. Although Greylock Production believes that it is in substantial compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with current requirements would not have a material adverse effect on Greylock Production's capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position, Greylock Production might not be able to maintain such compliance in the future. 
         The following is a summary of significant existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which Greylock Production's business operations are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on Greylock Production's capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position. 
 13

           Hazardous Substances and Wastes.    The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended, ("CERCLA"), also known as the Superfund law and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons who are considered to be jointly and severally responsible for the release of a "hazardous substance" into the environment. These persons include current and prior owners or operators of the site where the release occurred and entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these "responsible persons" may be liable for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and then to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other pollutants into the environment. Greylock Production handles materials in the course of Greylock Production's operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances. 
         Greylock Production also generates solid and hazardous wastes that are subject to the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended ("RCRA"), and comparable state statutes. RCRA imposes strict requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes. In the course of its operations, Greylock Production generates petroleum hydrocarbon wastes and ordinary industrial wastes that may be classified as hazardous wastes under CERCLA and comparable state laws. Drilling fluids, produced waters, and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, production, and development of crude oil or natural gas are currently regulated under RCRA as non-hazardous wastes. In 2016, however, the EPA entered into a settlement with environmental groups wherein it agreed to decide by March 2019 whether to revise the Agency's current determination exempting oil and gas wastes from regulation as RCRA hazardous wastes. While the EPA has not taken any action toward changing the status of oil and gas wastes under RCRA, any such change could result in an increase in the costs to manage and dispose of wastes generated by Greylock Production's operations. 
         Greylock Production currently owns or leases, and in the past may have owned or leased, properties that have been used for numerous years to explore and produce oil and natural gas. Although Greylock Production may have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons and wastes may have been disposed of or released at or from the properties owned or leased by Greylock Production or at or from the other locations where these hydrocarbons and wastes have been taken for treatment or disposal. In addition, certain of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons and wastes was not under Greylock Production's control. These properties and wastes disposed thereon may give rise to liability under CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, Greylock Production could be required to investigate, remove or remediate previously disposed wastes, to clean up contaminated property and to perform response actions to prevent future contamination. 
  Air Emissions.    The Clean Air Act ("CAA"), as amended, and comparable state laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. These laws and regulations may require Greylock Production to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, and to comply with stringent air permit or regulatory requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. Obtaining permits has the potential to delay the development of Greylock Production's properties. 
         The EPA has established pollution control standards for oil and gas sources under the CAA. In 2012, the EPA adopted federal New Source Performance Standards ("NSPS") that require the 
 14

   reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from certain fractured and refractured natural gas wells for which well completion operations are conducted and further require that most wells use reduced emission completions, also known as "green completions." These regulations also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from production-related wet seal and reciprocating compressors, and from pneumatic controllers and storage vessels. The EPA is also charged with establishing ambient air quality standards, the implementation of which can indirectly impact Greylock Production's operations. For example, in October 2015, the EPA lowered the National Ambient Air Quality Standard ("NAAQS"), for ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion. A number of state and industry petitioners filed suit in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, challenging the 2015 ozone NAAQS. The outcome of the litigation challenging the standard is unknown at this time. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit Greylock Production's ability to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment. While Greylock Production may be required to incur certain capital expenditures during the next few years for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions-related issues, at this time Greylock Production does not expect that such requirements have a material adverse effect on its operations. 
         Climate Change.    In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases ("GHGs") may present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA has issued regulations to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the CAA. These regulations include limits on tailpipe emissions from motor vehicles, preconstruction and operating permit requirements for certain large stationary sources, and methane emissions standards for certain new, modified and reconstructed oil and gas sources. The EPA also has adopted rules requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the United States, as well as certain onshore oil and natural gas production facilities, on an annual basis. 
         In December 2015, the EPA finalized rules that added new sources to the scope of its GHG monitoring and reporting rule. These new sources include gathering and boosting facilities. The revisions also include the addition of well identification reporting requirements for certain facilities. In addition, in June 2016 the EPA published a final rule that requires operators to reduce methane emissions from certain new, modified or reconstructed oil and gas facilities, including production, processing, transmission and storage activities ("Methane Rule"). However, following the November 2016 presidential election and change in administrations, in 2017 the EPA proposed to delay implementation of the Methane Rule, and also convened a reconsideration proceeding that resulted in two 2018 rulemaking projects aimed at rolling back certain Methane Rule requirements. These actions, like the Methane Rule itself, have been (or are likely to be) challenged in courts. While the ultimate fate of the Methane Rule is unclear, it may require Greylock Production to incur development expenses to install and utilize specific equipment, technologies, or work practices to control methane emissions from its operations. 
         More than one-third of the states have begun taking actions to control and/or reduce emissions of GHGs, primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. Although most of the state-level initiatives have to date focused on large sources of GHG emissions, such as coal-fired electric plants, it is possible that smaller sources of emissions could become subject to GHG emission limitations or allowance purchase requirements in the future. In addition, from time to time Congress has considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Any one of these climate change regulatory and legislative initiatives could have a material adverse effect on Greylock Production's business, capital expenditures, financial condition and results of operations. 
         The adoption and implementation of any regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, Greylock Production's equipment and operations could require Greylock Production to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with its operations or could 
 15

   adversely affect demand for the natural gas it produces. Legislation or regulations that may be adopted to address climate change could also affect the markets for Greylock Production's products by making its products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy. To the extent that its products are competing with higher GHG-emitting energy sources, Greylock Production's products may become more desirable in the market with more stringent limitations on GHG emissions. To the extent that its products are competing with lower GHG-emitting energy, Greylock Production's products may become less desirable in the market with more stringent limitations on greenhouse gas emissions. Greylock Production cannot predict with any certainty at this time how these possibilities may affect its operations. 
         Finally, some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on Greylock Production's assets and operations. 
         Water Discharges.    The federal Clean Water Act ("CWA") and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States and waters of the state, respectively. Pursuant to the CWA and analogous state laws, permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into state waters or waters of the United States. Any such discharge of pollutants into regulated waters must be performed in accordance with the terms of the permit issued by EPA or the analogous state agency. The discharge of wastewater from most onshore oil and gas activities exploration and production activities is currently prohibited east of the 98th meridian. Additionally, in June 2016, the EPA issued a final rule implementing wastewater pretreatment standards that prohibit onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities from sending certain wastewater directly to publicly owned treatment works ("POTW"). Unconventional extraction facilities can send wastewater to a private centralized wastewater treatment facility that can either discharge treated water or send it to a POTW. The EPA is conducting a study of the treatment and discharge of oil and gas wastewater. Additionally, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection has adopted a new permitting policy concerning surface water discharges from wastewater treatment facilities handling flowback fluids and produced waters from oil and gas well sites that could result in increased requirements for treatment of these fluids and limitations on their discharge to receiving waters. Any restriction of disposal options for hydraulic fracturing waste and other changes to CWA discharge requirements may result in increased costs. 
         The discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, is also prohibited in certain circumstances, unless authorized by a permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ("ACE"). CWA Section 401 provides that the applicant for an individual National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System ("NPDES") permit to be issued by the EPA or an individual Section 404 permit to be issued by the ACE must notify the state in which the discharge will occur and provide an opportunity for the state to determine if the discharge will comply with the state's approved water quality program. In some instances this process could result in delay in issuance of the permit, more stringent permit requirements, or denial of the permit. 
         In September 2015, new EPA and ACE rules defining the scope of the "waters of the United States," and EPA's and the ACE's jurisdiction, became effective ("2015 Rule"). The 2015 Rule has been challenged in multiple courts on the grounds that it unlawfully expands the reach of CWA programs. Due to the status of pending litigation, the 2015 Rule is currently in effect in certain states. In the remaining states, regulations in effect before promulgation of the 2015 Rule and guidance interpreting relevant United States Supreme Court rulings are in effect. On December 11, 2018, the heads of the EPA and ACE signed a proposed regulation that would revise the definition of waters of the United States to reduce its reach from the 2015 Rule ("2018 Pre-Proposal Rule"). The fates of the 2015 Rule and the 2018 Pre-Proposal Rule and applicability of the rules during current and future litigation are uncertain; however, to the extent the 2015 Rule is in effect, it expands the scope of CWA jurisdiction, 
 16

   and Greylock Production could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas or other waters of the United States. While there is significant uncertainty regarding the "waters of the United States" rule, Greylock Production believes that the rule, even in its 2015 form, would not have a material adverse effect on the cash distributions to the Trust unitholders. 
         Finally, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 ("OPA"), which amends the CWA, establishes standards for prevention, containment and cleanup of oil spills into waters of the United States. The OPA requires measures to be taken to prevent the accidental discharge of oil into waters of the United States from onshore production facilities. Measures under the OPA and/or the CWA include inspection and maintenance programs to minimize spills from oil storage and conveyance systems; the use of secondary containment systems to prevent spills from reaching nearby waterbodies; proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill; and the development and implementation of spill prevention, control and countermeasure ("SPCC") plans to prevent and respond to oil spills. The OPA also subjects owners and operators of facilities in certain instances to strict, joint and several liability for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from a spill. Greylock Production has developed and implemented SPCC plans for the Underlying Properties as required under the CWA. 
  Endangered Species Act.    The federal Endangered Species Act, as amended ("ESA"), restricts activities that may affect endangered and threatened species or their habitats. If endangered species are located in areas of the Underlying Properties where seismic surveys, development activities or abandonment operations may be conducted, the work could be prohibited or delayed or expensive mitigation may be required. The designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause Greylock Production to incur additional costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on the ability to develop and produce reserves from the Underlying Properties. 
  Employee Health and Safety.    The operations of Greylock Production are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended ("OSHA"), and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require in certain circumstances that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in Greylock Production's operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. 
  State Regulation.    Pennsylvania regulates the drilling for, and the production, gathering, storage, transport and sale of natural gas, including imposing requirements for obtaining drilling permits, the method of developing new fields, the spacing and operation of wells, production rates and the prevention of waste of natural gas resources. Any and all chemicals or other materials involved in the process must be disclosed and approved per statute. PADEP continues to implement new regulations specifically applicable to the development of unconventional gas wells. The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission is charged with enforcement of the gas well impact fees, penalties for nonpayment, and additional requirements resulting from the adoption of the amendments. Proposed regulations and new requirements resulting from the amendments could require Greylock Production to incur increased operating costs. Realized prices are not currently subject to state regulation or other similar direct economic regulation, but they could become subject to such regulation in the future. The effect of these regulations may be to limit the amounts of natural gas that may be produced from Greylock Production's and to limit the number of wells or locations Greylock Production can drill. 
 17



        Greylock Production believes that its continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on the cash distributions to the Trust unitholders. On December 24, 2015, Legacy ECA received a Notice of Violation ("NOV") from PADEP relating to Legacy ECA's operation of various water impoundments constructed on numerous well pad sites situated in Greene and Clearfield counties covering some of the Underlying Properties. Prior to the Acquisition, Legacy ECA reached a Consent Order and Agreement ("COA") with PADEP under which Legacy ECA agreed to pay a $1.7 million Civil Penalty Settlement to PADEP and to remediate the environmental impacts as described in the COA. However, pursuant to the conveyances these expenses incurred by Legacy ECA related to the NOV are not deductible from the proceeds due to the Trust and therefore did not affect cash distributions to Trust unitholders. As such, there were no material capital expenditures for remediation or pollution control activities for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, with respect to the Underlying Properties. 
   Description of the Trust Units 
         Each Trust unit is a unit of beneficial interest in the Trust and is entitled to receive cash distributions from the Trust on a pro rata basis. The Trust has 17,605,000 common units outstanding. 
   Distributions and Income Computations 
         Cash distributions to Trust unitholders are made from available funds of the Trust for each calendar quarter. Production payments due to the Trust with respect to any calendar quarter are accrued based on estimated production volumes attributable to the Trust properties during such quarter (as measured at Greylock Production metering systems) and market prices for such volumes. Greylock Production makes a payment to the Trust equal to such accrued amounts within 30 days of the end of each such calendar quarter. After receipt of such payment, the Trustee determines for such calendar quarter the amount of funds available for distribution to the Trust unitholders. Available funds are the excess cash, if any, received by the Trust over the Trust's expenses for that quarter, reduced by any net increases to reserves. Any difference between the payment made by Greylock Production to the Trust with respect to a calendar quarter and the actual cash production payments relative to the Trust properties received by Greylock Production will be netted to or against future payments by Greylock Production to the Trust. 
         The amount of available funds for distribution each quarter is payable to the Trust unitholders of record on or about the 45th day following the end of such calendar quarter or such later date as the Trustee determines is required to comply with legal or stock exchange requirements. The Trust distributes available cash on or about the 60th day (or the next succeeding business day following such day if such day is not a business day) following such calendar quarter to each person who was a Trust unitholder of record on the quarterly record date. 
         Unless otherwise advised by counsel or the IRS, the Trustee will treat the income and expenses of the Trust for each month as belonging to the Trust unitholders of record on the first business day of the month. 
   Transfer of Trust Units 
         Trust unitholders may transfer their Trust units in accordance with the Trust Agreement. The Trustee does not require either the transferor or transferee to pay a service charge for any transfer of a Trust unit. The Trustee may require payment of any tax or other governmental charge imposed for a transfer. The Trustee may treat the owner of any Trust unit as shown by its records as the owner of the Trust unit. The Trustee will not be considered to know about any claim or demand on a Trust unit by any party except the record owner. A person who acquires a Trust unit after any quarterly record date 
 18

   will not be entitled to any distribution relating to that quarterly record date. Delaware law governs all matters affecting the title, ownership or transfer of Trust units. 
   Periodic Reports 
         The Trustee files all required Trust federal and state income tax and information returns. The Trustee prepares and mails to each Trust unitholder a Schedule K-1 to enable unitholders to correctly report their respective share of the income and deductions of the Trust. The Trustee also causes to be prepared and filed reports required to be filed under the Exchange Act and by the rules of the New York Stock Exchange. 
         Each Trust unitholder and such unitholder's representatives may examine, for any proper purpose, during reasonable business hours, the records of the Trust. 
   Liability of Trust Unitholders 
         Under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, Trust unitholders will be entitled to the same limitation of personal liability extended to stockholders of private corporations for profit under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Nevertheless, courts in jurisdictions outside of Delaware may not give effect to such limitation. 
 Voting Rights of Trust Unitholders 
         The Trustee or Trust unitholders owning at least 10% of the outstanding Trust units may call meetings of Trust unitholders. The Trust will be responsible for all costs associated with calling a meeting of Trust unitholders unless such meeting is called by the Trust unitholders, in which case the Trust unitholders will be responsible for all costs associated with calling such meeting of Trust unitholders. Meetings must be held in such location as the Trustee designates in the notice of such meeting. The Trustee must send written notice of the time and place of the meeting and the matters to be acted upon to all of the Trust unitholders at least 20 days and not more than 60 days before the meeting. Trust unitholders holding a majority of Trust units outstanding must be present in person or represented by proxy to have a quorum. Each Trust unitholder is entitled to one vote for each Trust unit owned. 
         Unless otherwise required by the Trust Agreement, a matter may be approved or disapproved by the vote of a majority of the Trust units held by the Trust unitholders at a meeting where there is a quorum. This is true, even if a majority of the total outstanding Trust units did not approve it. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Trust units is required to:
 

Â• dissolve the Trust (except in accordance with its terms); 
Â• remove the Trustee or the Delaware Trustee; 
Â• amend the Trust Agreement, the royalty conveyances, the Administrative Services Agreement, the Development Agreement, the Royalty Interest Lien
and the hedge agreements (except with respect to certain matters that do not adversely affect the right of Trust unitholders in any material respect); 
Â• merge or consolidate the Trust with or into another entity; or 
Â• approve the sale of all or any material part of the assets of the Trust, 

 except that if any of the matters listed above (except removal of the Trustee or the Delaware Trustee) would result in a materially disproportionate benefit to Greylock Production or its affiliates compared to other owners of Trust units (to the extent that Greylock Production or any of its affiliates were to 
 19

   own any Trust units at that time), the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of Trust units, excluding Trust units owned by Greylock Production and its affiliates, is required. 
         In addition, certain amendments to the Trust Agreement may be made by the Trustee without approval of the Trust unitholders. The Trustee must consent before all or any part of the Trust assets can be sold except in connection with the dissolution of the Trust or limited sales directed by Greylock Production in conjunction with its sale of Underlying Properties. 
   Description of the Trust Agreement 
         The Trust was created under Delaware law to acquire and hold the Royalty Interests for the benefit of the Trust unitholders pursuant to an agreement between Legacy ECA, the Trustee and the Delaware Trustee. Greylock Production has assumed Legacy ECA's obligations under the Trust Agreement as described under "Â—Introduction" above. The Royalty Interests are passive in nature and neither the Trust nor the Trustee has any control over or responsibility for costs relating to the operation of the Underlying Properties. Neither Greylock Production nor other operators of the Underlying Properties have any contractual commitments to the Trust to provide additional funding or to conduct further drilling on or to maintain their ownership interest in any of these properties. 
         The Trust Agreement provides that the Trust's business activities are limited to owning the Royalty Interests and any activity reasonably related to such ownership, including activities required or permitted by the terms of the conveyances related to the Royalty Interests. As a result, the Trust is not permitted to acquire other oil and gas properties or royalty interests. The Trust is not able to issue any additional Trust units. 
   Duties and Powers of the Trustee 
         The duties of the Trustee are specified in the Trust Agreement and by the laws of the State of Delaware, except as modified by the Trust Agreement. The Trustee's principal duties consist of:
 

Â• collecting cash attributable to the Royalty Interests; 
Â• paying expenses, charges and obligations of the Trust from the Trust's assets; 
Â• making cash distributions to the Trust unitholders; 
Â• causing to be prepared and distributed a Schedule K-1 for each Trust unitholder and preparing and filing tax returns on behalf of the
Trust; and 
Â• causing to be prepared and filed reports required to be filed under the Exchange Act and by the rules of any securities exchange or quotation
system on which the Trust units are listed or admitted to trading. 

         If a Trust liability is contingent or uncertain in amount or not yet currently due and payable, the Trustee may create a cash reserve to pay for the liability. If the Trustee determines that the cash on hand and the cash to be received are insufficient to cover the Trust's liability, the Trust may borrow funds required to pay the liabilities. The Trust may borrow the funds from any person, including the Trustee or its affiliates. The terms of such indebtedness, if funds were loaned by the entity serving as Trustee or Delaware Trustee, would be similar to the terms which such entity would grant to a similarly situated commercial customer with whom it did not have a fiduciary relationship, and such entity shall be entitled to enforce its rights with respect to any such indebtedness as if it were not then serving as Trustee or Delaware Trustee. If the Trustee borrows funds, the Trust unitholders will not receive distributions until the borrowed funds are repaid. 
 20

     Responsibility and Liability of the Trustee 
         The duties and liabilities of the Trustee are set forth in the Trust Agreement. The Trust Agreement provides that (i) the Trustee shall not have any duties or liabilities, including fiduciary duties, except as expressly set forth in the Trust Agreement, and (ii) the duties and liabilities of the Trustee as set forth in the Trust Agreement replace any other duties and liabilities, including fiduciary duties, to which the Trustee might otherwise be subject. 
         The Trustee does not make business decisions affecting the assets of the Trust, and the Trustee's functions under the Trust Agreement are ministerial in nature. In discharging its duty to Trust unitholders, the Trustee may act in its discretion and will be liable to the Trust unitholders only for fraud, gross negligence or acts or omissions constituting bad faith. The Trustee will not be liable for any act or omission of its agents or employees unless the Trustee acted with fraud, in bad faith or with gross negligence in their selection and retention. The Trustee will be indemnified individually or as the Trustee for any liability or cost that it incurs in the administration of the Trust, except in cases of fraud, gross negligence or bad faith. The Trustee has a lien on the assets of the Trust as security for this indemnification and its compensation as Trustee. 
   Assets of the Trust 
         The assets of the Trust consist of the Royalty Interests, the Administrative Services Agreement, and any cash and temporary investments being held for the payment of expenses and liabilities and for distribution to the Trust unitholders. 
   Liabilities of the Trust 
         Because the Trust does not conduct an active business and the Trustee has little power to incur obligations, it is expected that the Trust will incur liabilities only for routine administrative expenses, such as the Trustee's fees and accounting, engineering, legal, tax advisory and other professional fees. 
   Fees and Expenses 
         The Trust is responsible for paying all legal, accounting, tax advisory, engineering, printing and other administrative and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by or at the direction of the Trustee or the Delaware Trustee. The Trust is also responsible for paying expenses of tax returns and Schedule K-1 preparation and distribution, as well as expenses incurred as a result of its being a publicly traded entity, including costs associated with annual and quarterly reports to unitholders, independent auditor fees and registrar and transfer agent fees. 
 Duration of the Trust; Sale of Royalty Interests 
         The Trust is expected to remain in existence until the Termination Date, which is March 31, 2030. The Trust will dissolve prior to the Termination Date if:
 

Â• the Trust sells all of the Royalty Interests; 
Â• gross proceeds attributable to the Royalty Interests over any four consecutive quarters are less than $1.5 million; 
Â• the holders of a majority of the outstanding Trust units vote in favor of dissolution; or 
Â• the Trust is judicially dissolved. 

         The Trustee would then sell all of the Trust's assets, either by private sale or public auction, and distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the Trust unitholders. 
 21

     Greylock Production's Right of First Refusal 
         Greylock Production has a right of first refusal to purchase the Perpetual Royalty Interests upon termination of the Trust. This right of first refusal provides that the Trustee will use commercially reasonable efforts to retain a third-party advisor to market the Perpetual Royalty Interests within 30 business days of the termination of the Trust. If the Trustee receives a bid from a proposed purchaser other than Greylock Production, prior to selling all or part of the Perpetual Royalty Interests, it will be required to give notice (the "Offer Notice") to Greylock Production, identifying the proposed purchaser and setting forth the proposed sale price, payment terms and other material terms of the proposed sale. Greylock Production would then have 30 days from receipt of the Offer Notice to elect, by notice to the Trustee, to purchase the subject properties offered for sale on the terms and conditions set forth in the Offer Notice. If Greylock Production makes such election, the proposed purchaser would be entitled to receive reimbursement of its reasonable and documented expenses incurred in connection with its review and analysis of the subject properties and bid preparation. Greylock Production and the Trust would share equally the cost of reimbursement to the proposed purchaser. 
         If Greylock Production does not give notice within the 30-day period following the Offer Notice, the Trust may sell such properties to the identified purchaser on terms and conditions that are substantially the same as those previously set forth in such Offer Notice. 
         If, after a reasonable marketing period, no bid is received on any or all of the Perpetual Royalty Interests from any party other than Greylock Production, then, as a condition to the sale, Greylock Production shall obtain, at the Trust's expense, and deliver to the Trustee, a fairness opinion from a nationally-recognized valuation firm with expertise in fairness opinions stating that the proposed sale price to be paid by Greylock Production to the Trust for the properties is fair to the Trust. 
   Federal Income Tax Considerations 
         The Trust's federal income tax reporting position is that it should be classified as a partnership for federal and applicable state income tax purposes. This position relies on the opinion of counsel to Legacy ECA and the Trust rendered in connection with the initial public offering of the Trust units, in which counsel opined that at least 90% of the Trust's gross income will be qualifying income within the meaning of IRC Section 7704. The Trust's federal income tax reporting positions are consistent with the Federal Income Tax Considerations section in the Trust's prospectus ("the Prospectus") filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), on July 1, 2010 in connection with the offering of its common units to the public (the "Federal Income Tax Considerations Section in the Prospectus"). However, as discussed in detail below under Item 1A. Risk FactorsÂ—Tax Risks Related to the Trust's Common Units, the Trust has not requested a ruling from the IRS regarding its United States federal income tax reporting positions and its positions may not be sustained by a court or if contested by the IRS. Additional information regarding the opinion and tax matters is discussed in the Federal Income Tax Considerations Section in the Prospectus. 
 Miscellaneous 
         The Trustee may consult with counsel, accountants, tax advisors, geologists and engineers and other parties the Trustee believes to be qualified as experts on the matters for which advice is sought. The Trustee will be protected for any action it takes in good faith reliance upon the opinion of the expert. 
         The Delaware Trustee and the Trustee may resign at any time or be removed with or without cause at any time by a vote of not less than a majority of the outstanding Trust units. Any successor must be a bank or trust company meeting certain requirements including having combined capital, surplus and undivided profits of at least $20 million, in the case of the Delaware Trustee, and $100 million, in the case of the Trustee.
