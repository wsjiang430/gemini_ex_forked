 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 Overview
 Air Lease Corporation (the “Company”, “ALC”, “we”, “our” or “us”) is a leading aircraft leasing company that was founded by aircraft leasing industry pioneer, Steven F. Udvar-Házy. We are principally engaged in purchasing new commercial jet transport aircraft directly from aircraft manufacturers, such as The Boeing Company (“Boeing”) and Airbus S.A.S. (“Airbus”), and leasing those aircraft to airlines throughout the world with the intention to generate attractive returns on equity. In addition to our leasing activities, we sell aircraft from our operating lease portfolio to third parties, including other leasing companies, financial services companies, airlines and through our asset-backed securities platform. We also provide fleet management services to investors and owners of aircraft portfolios for a management fee.  Our operating performance is driven by the growth of our fleet, the terms of our leases, the interest rates on our debt, and the aggregate amount of our indebtedness, supplemented by the gains from our aircraft sales and trading activities and our management fees.
 We currently have relationships with over 200 airlines across 70 countries. We operate our business on a global basis, providing aircraft to airline customers in every major geographical region, including markets such as Asia, the Pacific Rim, Latin America, the Middle East, Europe, Africa, and North America. Many of these markets are experiencing increased demand for passenger airline travel and have lower market saturation than more mature markets such as the United States and Western Europe. We expect that these markets will also present significant replacement opportunities in upcoming years as many airlines look to replace aging aircraft with new, modern technology, fuel efficient jet aircraft. An important focus of our strategy is meeting the needs of this replacement market. Airlines in some of these markets have fewer financing alternatives, enabling us to command relatively higher lease rates compared to those in more mature markets.
 We mitigate the risks of owning and leasing aircraft through careful management and diversification of our leases and lessees by geography, lease term, and aircraft age and type. We believe that diversification of our operating lease portfolio reduces the risks associated with individual lessee defaults and adverse geopolitical and regional economic events. We mitigate the risks associated with cyclical variations in the airline industry by managing customer concentrations and lease maturities in our operating lease portfolio to minimize periods of concentrated lease expirations. In order to maximize residual values and minimize the risk of obsolescence, our strategy is to own an aircraft during the first third of its expected 25 year useful life.
 During the year ended December 31, 2018, we purchased and took delivery of 37 aircraft from our new order pipeline, purchased nine incremental aircraft and sold 15 aircraft, ending the period with a total of 275 aircraft with a net book value of $15.7 billion.  The weighted average lease term remaining on our operating lease portfolio was 6.8 years and the weighted average age of our fleet was 3.8 years as of December 31, 2018.  Our fleet grew by 18.3% based on net book value of $15.7 billion as of December 31, 2018 compared to $13.3 billion as of December 31, 2017. In addition, we had a managed fleet of 61 aircraft as of December 31, 2018, compared to a managed fleet of 50 aircraft as of December 31, 2017.  We have a globally diversified customer base comprised of 94 airlines in 56 countries. As of February 21, 2019, all aircraft in our operating lease portfolio, except for one aircraft, were subject to lease agreements.
 During 2018, we increased our total commitments with Boeing and Airbus by a net 41 aircraft and added 45 option orders to acquire aircraft. As of December 31, 2018, we had commitments to purchase 372 aircraft from Boeing and Airbus for delivery through 2024, with an estimated aggregate commitment of $26.3 billion.  We ended 2018 with $25.7 billion in committed minimum future rental payments and placed 72% of our order book on long-term leases for aircraft delivering through 2021.  This includes $11.8 billion in contracted minimum rental payments on the aircraft in our existing fleet and $13.9 billion in minimum future rental payments related to aircraft which will deliver between 2019 and 2022.

 We finance the purchase of aircraft and our business with available cash balances, internally generated funds, including aircraft sales and trading activities and debt financings. Our debt financing strategy is focused on raising unsecured debt in the global bank and debt capital markets, with a limited utilization of export credit or other forms of secured financing. In 2018, we issued a total of $3.03 billion in senior unsecured notes bearing interest at fixed rates ranging from 2.50% to 4.625% with one note bearing interest at a floating rate of LIBOR plus 1.125%, with maturities ranging from 2021 to 2028. In addition, we increased our unsecured revolving credit facility capacity to approximately $4.6 billion, representing a 21.7% increase from 2017 and extended the final maturity to May 5, 2022 with an interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.05%. We ended 2018 with total debt outstanding, net of discounts and issuance costs, of $11.5 billion, of which 86.4% was at a fixed rate and 96.5% of which was unsecured.  As of December 31, 2018, our composite cost of funds was 3.46%.
 In 2018, total revenues increased by 10.8% to $1.7 billion, compared to 2017.  The increase in our total revenues is primarily due to the $2.4 billion increase in the net book value of our operating lease portfolio. Income before taxes increased 5.0% to $640.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $609.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.  The increase in our income before taxes was principally driven by the continued growth of our fleet, partially offset by a reduction of our aircraft sales and trading activities.  Our pre-tax profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 38.1% as compared to 40.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017.
 During the year ended December 31, 2018, our net income was $510.8 million, or $4.60 per diluted share, compared to $756.2 million, or $6.82 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Reform Act”), which was effective beginning January 1, 2018, which resulted in a tax benefit of $354.1 million, or $3.17 per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2017.  This decrease in net income was partially offset by the continued growth in our fleet.
 Our adjusted net income before income taxes excludes the effects of certain non-cash items, one-time or non-recurring items, such as settlement expense, net of recoveries, that are not expected to continue in the future and certain other items. Our adjusted net income before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $690.3 million or $6.20 per diluted share, compared to $657.8 million, or $5.94 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in our adjusted net income before income taxes was principally driven by the continued growth of our fleet, partially offset by a reduction in our aircraft sales and trading activity. Our adjusted margin before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 41.1% compared to 43.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017.  Adjusted net income before income taxes, adjusted margin before income taxes and adjusted diluted earnings per share before income taxes are measures of financial and operational performance that are not defined by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”).  See Note 3 in “Item 6. Selected Financial Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of adjusted net income before income taxes and adjusted diluted earnings per share before income taxes as non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation of these measures to net income.

  For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, China was the only individual country that represented at least 10% of our rental revenue based on each airline's principal place of business. In 2018, 2017, and 2016, no rental revenue from any individual airline represented 10% or more of our rental revenue. 
 Aircraft Acquisition Strategy
 We seek to acquire the most highly in demand and widely distributed, modern technology, fuel efficient narrowbody and widebody commercial jet transport aircraft. Our strategy is to order new aircraft directly from the manufacturers. When placing new aircraft orders with the manufacturers, we strategically target the replacement of aging aircraft with modern technology aircraft. Additionally, we look to supplement our order pipeline with opportunistic purchases of aircraft in the secondary market and participate in sale-leaseback transactions with airlines.
 Prior to ordering aircraft, we evaluate the market for specific types of aircraft. We consider the overall demand for the aircraft type in the marketplace based on our deep knowledge of the aviation industry and our customer relationships. It is important to assess the airplane’s economic viability, the operating performance characteristics, engine variant options, intended utilization by our customers, and which aircraft types it will replace or compete with in the global market. Additionally, we study the effects of global airline passenger traffic growth in order to determine the likely demand for our new aircraft upon delivery.
 For new aircraft deliveries, we source many components separately, which include seats, safety equipment, avionics, galleys, cabin finishes, engines, and other equipment. Oftentimes, we are able to achieve lower pricing through direct bulk purchase contracts with the component manufacturers than would be achievable if we relied on the airframe manufacturers to source the components for the aircraft themselves. Airframe manufacturers such as Boeing and Airbus install this buyer furnished equipment in our aircraft during the final assembly process at their facilities. With this purchasing strategy, we are able to both meet specific customer configuration requirements and lower our total acquisition cost of the aircraft.
 Aircraft Leasing Strategy
 The airline industry is a complex industry with constantly evolving competition, code shares (where two or more airlines share the same flight), alliances, and passenger traffic patterns. This requires frequent updating and flexibility within an airline’s fleet. The operating lease allows airlines to effectively adapt and manage their fleets through varying market conditions without bearing the full financial risk associated with these capital intensive assets which have an expected useful life of 25 years. This fleet flexibility enables airlines to more effectively operate and compete in their respective markets. We work closely with our airline customers throughout the world to help optimize their long-term aircraft fleet strategies. We may also, from time to time, work with our airline customers to assist them in obtaining financing for aircraft.

 We work to mitigate the risks associated with owning and leasing aircraft and cyclical variations in the airline industry through careful management of our fleet, including managing customer concentrations by geography and region, entering into long term leases, staggering lease maturities, balancing aircraft type exposures, and maintaining a young fleet age. We believe that diversification of our operating lease portfolio reduces the risks associated with individual customer defaults and the impact of adverse geopolitical and regional economic events. In order to maximize residual values and minimize the risk of obsolescence, our strategy is generally to own an aircraft for approximately the first third of its expected 25 year useful life.
 Our management team identifies prospective airline customers based upon industry knowledge and long‑standing relationships. Prior to leasing an aircraft, we evaluate the competitive positioning of the airline, the strength and quality of the management team, and the financial performance of the airline. Management obtains and reviews relevant business materials from all prospective customers before entering into a lease agreement. Under certain circumstances, the customer may be required to obtain guarantees or other financial support from a sovereign entity or a financial institution. We work closely with our existing customers and potential lessees to develop customized lease structures that address their specific needs. We typically enter into a lease agreement 18 to 36 months in advance of the delivery of a new aircraft from our order book. Once the aircraft has been delivered and operated by the airline, we look to remarket the aircraft and sign a follow-on lease six to 12 months ahead of the scheduled expiry of the initial lease term. Our leases typically contain the following key provisions:

· | primarily structured as operating leases, whereby we retain the residual rights to the aircraft;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | primarily structured as triple net leases, whereby the lessee is responsible for all operating costs including taxes, insurance, and aircraft maintenance;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | require all payments be made in U.S. dollars;
--+----------------------------------------------


· | are for fixed rates and terms;
--+-------------------------------


· | require cash security deposits and maintenance reserve payments; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


· | contain provisions which require payment whether or not the aircraft is operated, irrespective of the circumstances.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In addition, our leases require the lessee to be responsible for compliance with applicable laws and regulations with respect to the aircraft. We require our lessees to comply with the standards of either the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) or its equivalent in foreign jurisdictions. As a function of these laws and the provisions in our lease contracts, the lessees are responsible for performing all maintenance of the aircraft and return of the aircraft and its components in a specified return condition. Generally, we receive a cash deposit and maintenance reserves as security for the lessee’s performance of its obligations under the lease and the condition of the aircraft upon return. In addition, most leases contain extensive provisions regarding our remedies and rights in the event of a default by a lessee. The lessee generally is required to continue to make lease payments under all circumstances, including periods during which the aircraft is not in operation due to maintenance or grounding.
 Some foreign countries have currency and exchange laws regulating the international transfer of currencies. When necessary, we may require, as a condition to any foreign transaction, that the lessee or purchaser in a foreign country obtain the necessary approvals of the appropriate government agency, finance ministry, or central bank for the remittance of all funds contractually owed in U.S. dollars. We attempt to minimize our currency and exchange risks by negotiating the designated payment currency in our leases to be U.S. dollars. To meet the needs of certain of our airline customers, we have agreed to accept certain lease payments in a foreign currency. After we agree to the rental payment currency with an airline, the negotiated currency typically remains for the term of the lease. We may enter into contracts to mitigate our foreign currency risk, but we expect that the economic risk arising from foreign currency denominated leases will be immaterial to us.

 We may, in connection with the lease of used aircraft, agree to contribute specific additional amounts to the cost of certain first major maintenance events or modifications, which usually reflect the usage of the aircraft prior to the commencement of the lease. We may be obligated under the leases to make reimbursements of maintenance reserves previously received to lessees for expenses incurred for certain planned major maintenance. We also, on occasion, may contribute towards aircraft modifications and recover any such costs over the life of the lease.
 Monitoring
 During the lease term, we closely follow the operating and financial performance of our lessees. We maintain a high level of communication with the lessee and frequently evaluate the state of the market in which the lessee operates, including the impact of changes in passenger air travel and preferences, the impact of delivery delays, changes in general economic conditions, emerging competition, new government regulations, regional catastrophes, and other unforeseen shocks that are relevant to the airline's market. This enables us to identify lessees that may be experiencing operating and financial difficulties. This identification assists us in assessing the lessee's ability to fulfill its obligations under the lease. This monitoring also identifies candidates, where appropriate, to restructure the lease prior to the lessee's insolvency or the initiation of bankruptcy or similar proceedings. Once an insolvency or bankruptcy occurs, we typically have less control over, and would most likely incur greater costs in connection with, the restructuring of the lease or the repossession of the aircraft.
 During the life of the lease, situations may lead us to restructure leases with our lessees. When we repossess an aircraft leased in a foreign country, we generally expect to export the aircraft from the lessee’s jurisdiction. In some very limited situations, the lessees may not fully cooperate in returning the aircraft. In those cases, we will take appropriate legal action, a process that could ultimately delay the return and export of the aircraft. In addition, in connection with the repossession of an aircraft, we may be required to pay outstanding mechanics’ liens, airport charges, navigation fees and other amounts secured by liens on the repossessed aircraft. These charges could relate to other aircraft that we do not own but were operated by the lessee.
 Remarketing
 Our lease agreements are generally structured to require lessees to notify us nine to 12 months in advance of the lease’s expiration if a lessee desires to renew or extend the lease. Requiring lessees to provide us with such advance notice provides our management team with an extended period of time to consider a broad set of alternatives with respect to the aircraft, including assessing general market and competitive conditions and preparing to remarket or sell the aircraft. If a lessee fails to provide us with notice, the lease will automatically expire at the end of the term, and the lessee will be required to return the aircraft pursuant to the conditions in the lease. As discussed above, our leases contain detailed provisions regarding the required condition of the aircraft and its components upon redelivery at the end of the lease term. Aircraft Sales & Trading Strategy
 Our strategy is to maintain a portfolio of young aircraft with a widely diversified customer base. In order to achieve this profile, we primarily order new planes directly from the manufacturers, place them on long term leases, and sell the aircraft when they near the end of the first third of their expected 25 year economic useful lives. We typically sell aircraft that are currently operated by an airline with multiple years of lease term remaining on the contract, in order to achieve the maximum disposition value of the aircraft. Buyers of the aircraft may include other leasing companies, financial institutions, airlines and our asset-backed securities platform. We also, from time to time, buy and sell aircraft on an opportunistic basis for trading profits. In the past three years ended December 31, 2018, we sold 92 aircraft. Additionally, as discussed below, we may provide management services to buyers of our aircraft asset for a fee.

 Aircraft Management Strategy
 We supplement our core business model by providing fleet management services to third party investors and owners of aircraft portfolios for a management fee. This allows us to better serve our airline customers and expand our existing airline customer base by providing additional leasing opportunities beyond our own aircraft portfolio, new order pipeline, and customer or regional concentration limits. As of December 31, 2018, we had a managed fleet of 61 aircraft. Financing Strategy
 We finance the purchase of aircraft and our business with available cash balances, internally generated funds, including aircraft sales and trading activity and debt financings. We have structured the Company to have investment grade credit metrics and our debt financing strategy has focused on funding our business on an unsecured basis. Unsecured financing provides us with operational flexibility when selling or transitioning aircraft from one airline to another. We have in the past, and we may in the future, utilize export credit or other forms of secured financing to a limited extent. Insurance
 We require our lessees to carry those types of insurance that are customary in the air transportation industry, including comprehensive liability insurance, aircraft all‑risk hull insurance, and war‑risk insurance covering risks such as hijacking, terrorism (but excluding coverage for weapons of mass destruction and nuclear events), confiscation, expropriation, seizure, and nationalization. We generally require a certificate of insurance from the lessee’s insurance broker prior to delivery of an aircraft. Generally, all certificates of insurance contain a breach of warranty endorsement so that our interests are not prejudiced by any act or omission of the lessee. Lease agreements generally require hull and liability limits to be in U.S. dollars, which are shown on the certificate of insurance.
 Insurance premiums are to be paid by the lessee, with coverage acknowledged by the broker or carrier. The territorial coverage, in each case, should be suitable for the lessee’s area of operations. We generally require that the certificates of insurance contain, among other provisions, a provision prohibiting cancellation or material change without at least 30 days’ advance written notice to the insurance broker (who would be obligated to give us prompt notice), except in the case of hull war insurance policies, which customarily only provide seven days’ advance written notice for cancellation and may be subject to shorter notice under certain market conditions. Furthermore, the insurance is primary and not contributory, and we require that all insurance carriers be required to waive rights of subrogation against us.
 The stipulated loss value schedule under aircraft hull insurance policies is on an agreed‑value basis acceptable to us and usually exceeds the book value of the aircraft. In cases where we believe that the agreed value stated in the lease is not sufficient, we make arrangements to cover such deficiency, which would include the purchase of additional “Total Loss Only” coverage for the deficiency.
 Aircraft hull policies generally contain standard clauses covering aircraft engines. The lessee is required to pay all deductibles. Furthermore, the hull war policies generally contain full war risk endorsements, including, but not limited to, confiscation (where available), seizure, hijacking and similar forms of retention or terrorist acts.
 The comprehensive liability insurance listed on certificates of insurance generally include provisions for bodily injury, property damage, passenger liability, cargo liability, and such other provisions reasonably necessary in commercial passenger and cargo airline operations. We expect that such certificates of insurance list combined comprehensive single liability limits of not less than $500.0 million for Airbus and Boeing aircraft and $200.0 million for Embraer S.A. (“Embraer”). As a standard in the industry, airline operator's policies contain a sublimit for third-party war risk liability generally in the amount of at least $150.0 million. We require each lessee to purchase higher limits of third-party war risk liability or obtain an indemnity from its respective government.
 The international aviation insurance market has exclusions for physical damage to aircraft hulls caused by dirty bombs, bio‑hazardous materials, and electromagnetic pulsing. Exclusions for the same type of perils could be introduced into liability policies in the future.

 We cannot assure you that our lessees will be adequately insured against all risks, that lessees will at all times comply with their obligations to maintain insurance, that any particular claim will be paid, or that lessees will be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates in the future.
 Separately, we purchase contingent liability insurance and contingent hull insurance on all aircraft in our fleet and maintain other insurance covering the specific needs of our business operations. While we believe our insurance is adequate both as to coverages and amounts, we cannot assure you that we are adequately insured against all risks.
 Competition
 The leasing, remarketing, and sale of aircraft is highly competitive. We are one of the largest aircraft lessors operating on a global scale.  We face competition from aircraft manufacturers, banks, financial institutions, other leasing companies, aircraft brokers, and airlines. Some of our competitors may have greater operating and financial resources and access to lower capital costs than we have. Competition for leasing transactions is based on a number of factors, including delivery dates, lease rates, lease terms, other lease provisions, aircraft condition, and the availability in the marketplace of the types of aircraft required to meet the needs of airline customers. Competition in the purchase and sale of used aircraft is based principally on the availability of used aircraft, price, the terms of the lease to which an aircraft is subject, and the creditworthiness of the lessee, if any. Government Regulation
 The air transportation industry is highly regulated. We do not operate commercial aircraft, and thus may not be directly subject to many industry laws and regulations, such as regulations of the U.S. Department of State (the “DOS”), the U.S. Department of Transportation, or their counterpart organizations in foreign countries regarding the operation of aircraft for public transportation of passengers and property. As discussed below, however, we are subject to government regulation in a number of respects. In addition, our lessees are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the jurisdictions in which they are registered or operate. These laws govern, among other things, the registration, operation, maintenance, and condition of the aircraft.
 We are required to register our aircraft with an aviation authority mutually agreed upon with our lessee. Each aircraft registered to fly must have a Certificate of Airworthiness, which is a certificate demonstrating the aircraft’s compliance with applicable government rules and regulations and that the aircraft is considered airworthy. Each airline we lease to must have a valid operation certificate to operate our aircraft. Our lessees are obligated to maintain the Certificates of Airworthiness for the aircraft they lease.
 Our involvement with the civil aviation authorities of foreign jurisdictions consists largely of requests to register and deregister our aircraft on those countries’ registries.
 We are also subject to the regulatory authority of the DOS and the U.S. Department of Commerce (the “DOC”) to the extent such authority relates to the export of aircraft for lease and sale to foreign entities and the export of parts to be installed on our aircraft. We may be required to obtain export licenses for parts installed in aircraft exported to foreign countries. The DOC and the U.S. Department of the Treasury (through its Office of Foreign Assets Control, or "OFAC") impose restrictions on the operation of U.S.-made goods, such as aircraft and engines, in sanctioned countries, as well as on the ability of U.S. companies to conduct business with entities in those countries. The U.S. Patriot Act of 2001 (the “Patriot Act”) prohibits financial transactions by U.S. persons, including U.S. individuals, entities, and charitable organizations, with individuals and organizations designated as terrorists and terrorist supporters by the U.S. Secretary of State or the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection, a law enforcement agency of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, enforces regulations related to the import of aircraft into the United States for maintenance or lease and the importation of parts into the U.S. for installation.


 
  11

 

 Jurisdictions in which aircraft are registered as well as jurisdictions in which they operate may impose regulations relating to noise and emission standards. In addition, most countries’ aviation laws require aircraft to be maintained under an approved maintenance program with defined procedures and intervals for inspection, maintenance and repair.
