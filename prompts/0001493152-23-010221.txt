Business Strategy
 
Our wholly owned subsidiary RLSP, as an automotive rubber and plastic sealing strip manufacturer, has obtained certificates as first-tier supplier to manufacture sealing strips for some auto Original Equipment Manufacturers (the “OEMs”), such as eGT New Energy Automotive Co., Ltd. (“eGT”), Dongfeng Motor Corporation (“Dongfeng”), French Renault and Volkswagen. RLSP started to supply automotive rubber and plastic sealing strips to eGT, the joint venture of Dongfeng and French Renault since September 2019. Meanwhile, RLSP also obtained certificates as second-tier manufacturer of automotive rubber and plastic sealing strip from some Branded Automobile Manufacturers (the “Auto Manufacturers”). Although RLSP just started to engage in the automotive sealing strip market in China since 2019, high-quality customers and our own unique advantages have allowed us to grow rapidly and accelerate our market share.

● | Main Products 
--+------------------

 
Since its establishment, the Company has been engaged in the research and development, design, production and sales of auto parts such as automobile sealing strips. The Company has strong tooling and mold and special equipment development capabilities, simultaneous development capabilities and overall product design capabilities. It mainly supplies sealing strip products for domestic and foreign automobile manufacturers, as well as supporting research and development and follow-up services.
 

● | Technology development advantage 
--+-------------------------------------

 
With years of exploration in the rubber industry, the Company has formed a strong technical advantage in the field of rubber formulations. The Company’s high-hardness rubber and low-density sponge production technology have reached the domestic leading level. We are also expertise in the areas of rubber vulcanization technology, modular development technology, three-dimensional molding technology, seamless interface technology, surface pre-coating technology and surface flocking. The Company is a leading candidate in the development and application of technology, rubber mixing process technology, CAE, CAD analysis simultaneous development technology and length control technology, and has applied these technologies to mass production. Now we also achieved the experience and technical ability to develop synchronously with the auto OEMs.
 

● | Customer resource advantage 
--+--------------------------------

 
For auto parts manufacturers that provide supporting supplies to auto OEMs, establishing and maintaining cooperative relationships with as many mainstream auto OEMs as possible is the key to their survival and development. The Company has established a strong cooperative relationship with internationally renowned automobile manufacturers. Become a supplier of Renault, Dongfeng and Nissan. The assessment of qualified suppliers by automobile manufacturers is very strict. The assessment indicators often include enterprise scale, quality system, technology development capabilities, quality capabilities, on-site 5S, procurement management, process management, quality improvement capabilities, human resource training and other aspects. The cycle is usually as long as 1-3 years. With the increasingly fierce competition in the automobile manufacturing industry, auto OEMs have higher and higher requirements for the comprehensive strength and industry experience of their suppliers. The experience of providing supporting services for mainstream auto OEMs has become more and more customers choosing supplies. An important standard for quotient. Therefore, the automobile manufacturing industry has gradually become a relatively closed ecosystem, and only auto parts suppliers with high-quality customer resources can enter a virtuous circle of development.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Our main products are automotive rubber and plastic sealing strips produced for specific models. The products have typical personalized customization features, so the direct sales model is basically adopted. The Company directly contacts the auto OEMs or the first-tier suppliers of the auto OEMs to obtain supplier qualifications, clarify product specifications and models, negotiate product prices, and obtain orders.
 
All of our executives are excellent industry professionals with extensive experience in the automotive-related industry for more than 20 years. They have a wealth of experience and contacts to help companies to expand the markets. Although it takes a long time to obtain the auto OEMs’ approval, once the company becomes supplier, the order is very stable for years.
 
Our sales process can generally be divided into two stages: product development and mass supply. In the product development stage, the company first needs to establish contact with customers and enter the list of qualified suppliers through a series of reviews by customers. After obtaining the project through bidding and other methods, the company will develop new models simultaneously with the automaker and its component suppliers or improve the development of seal products for mass-produced models, and develop models that meet the functions and performance of the models’ cost and other requirements. Before confirming the batch supply, the customer will further check the issuer’s factory area, production line, management system, etc., to confirm the issuer’s mass supply capability and product quality consistency. This stage lasts for a long time. The improved development of seals for mass-produced models generally takes about 6 months, and the simultaneous development of new models with auto OEMs and their accessory suppliers often takes a year or more.
 
Based on considerations such as cost and product consistency, auto OEMs generally choose one or two major suppliers for the same automotive seal product. Therefore, in the batch supply stage, the company can generally obtain continuous and stable orders based on the production and sales volume of this model. At this stage, the company’s main work is to provide timely and stable quality products based on customer orders, provide after-sales service, negotiate quotations, and sign price contracts on a regular or irregular basis. This stage is the main source of company income.
 
Our sales is substantial dependence on one major customer, Shanghai Xinsen Import & Export Co., Ltd (“Shanghai Xinsen”) for year ended December 31, 2022 which is also our related party. Effective on October 1, 2022, Ms. Xingxiu Hua, the President of the Company, has reduced her direct ownership of Shanghai Xinsen from 90% to 15%, and she is also no longer served as the Legal Representative and General Manager of Shanghai Xinsen pursuant to the board resolution of Shanghai Xinsen at the same date. The changes have been made and certified by the local government on October 11, 2022. The main reason for Ms. Hua’s ownership change in Shanghai Xinsen is due to her personal arrangement to focus more on RLSP’s business strategy improvement and market development. Nevertheless, we expect our future sales to Shanghai Xinsen will not be impacted by Ms. Hua’s ownership change since RLSP has established a matured sales system with Shanghai Xinsen in the past years, and moreover, Shanghai Hongyang and Wuhu Huichi, the customers of Shanghai Xinsen and who indirectly purchased RLSP’s products through Shanghai Xinsen, have been using RLSP’s products stably and consistently for many years.

The Company currently operates with two sales models, the direct supply model and indirect supply model:
 
Model A: Direct supply model. Upon passing the on-site inspections of auto Original Equipment Manufacturers (the “OEMs”), RLSP is listed at the auto OEMs’ directories being one of their first-tier suppliers who will purchase raw materials, produce final products independently, and deliver finished products to the auto OEMs’ warehouses directly. RLSP satisfies its performance obligation when its finished products are delivered to the auto OEMs’ warehouses and a follow-up quality inspection is accepted by the auto OEMs. Meanwhile, the auto OEMs will also request product replacement for disqualified products. The ownership and control of our finished products are transferred to our customers as soon as the products passed the inspection and acceptance into the warehouses of the auto OEMs. Our revenue will be recognized once the control of our products has been transferred to our customers, and the payments will be paid by the auto OEMs directly.
 
Model B: Indirect supply model. RLSP received the purchase orders from our related parties-Shanghai Xinsen Import & Export Co., Ltd (“Shanghai Xinsen”) and Xinsen Sealing Products (Hangzhou) Co., Ltd (“Hangzhou Xinsen”) (collectively named as “Xinsen Group” for two companies together). The Company’s President, Ms. Xingxiu Hua, previously held 90% ownership of Shanghai Xinsen and Shanghai Xinsen holds 70% ownership of Hangzhou Xinsen, or Ms. Hua owns 63% ownership of Hangzhou Xinsen, respectively. Effective on October 1, 2022, Ms. Hua reduced her ownership of Shanghai Xinsen from 90% to 15%, and so accordingly reduced her indirect ownership of Hangzhou Xinsen from 63% to 10.5%. Branded Automobile Manufacturers (the “Auto Manufacturers”) send a lump sum purchase orders of the whole vehicle rubber and plastic auto parts of one model to their first-tier suppliers, who then subcontract rubber and plastic seals to Xinsen Group. Xinsen Group is a certified second-tier supplier of Auto Manufacturers who then subcontracts some products that they do not have capability to manufacture to RLSP. Once purchase orders received, RLSP purchased rubber materials from our venders and outsourced the purchase orders to third party manufacturer for work-in-process products (“WIP”) or finished products in its entirely based on management’s decision under the operating circumstances. RLSP has two forms of outsourced processing under Model B:
 
1). RLSP purchases raw materials and subcontracts the third-party manufacturers to produce WIP. Once WIP is finished and delivered to RLSP’s warehouse, RLSP performs some manual processes, such as welding and constructing in order to meet the specification of the purchase orders, the final products are concluded after strict quality inspection.
 
2). RLSP purchases raw materials and subcontracts third party manufacturers to produce finished products. RLSP will perform the responsibilities to trace and observe each step of production from the third-party manufacturers.
 
The finished products will be delivered to the first-tier suppliers’ warehouses, the downstream customers of Xinsen Group either from RLSP or third-party manufacturers’ locations. Xinsen Group will assign inspectors and perform quality inspection when the finished products are delivered. RLSP satisfies its performance obligation when the finished products are delivered to Xinsen Group’s customers and the quality inspection is qualified performed by Xinsen Group. Meanwhile, Xinsen Group will also request product replacement for disqualified products. Once the quality and quantity are confirmed and finished products are acceptable into the warehouses of Xinsen Group’s customers, receiving notes will be provided by Xinsen Group’s customers, then to RLSP as proof of delivery. The date of receiving notes signed is the time that RLSP transfers ownership and control of the finished products under model B to Xinsen Group then indirectly to the first-tier suppliers. RLSP recognizes revenue on the dates when receiving notes are signed by Xinsen Group’s customers.
 
The following diagram shows how sales are generate, how invoices and payments are processed and how the company’s products are manufactured and distributed to its customers, for our direct and indirect supply models.

Vendors
 
In order to reduce the purchase cost and enhance the purchase power, our subsidiary, RLSP mainly purchases the raw materials from Shanghai Haozong Rubber & Plastic Technology Co., Ltd. (“Shanghai Haozong”) at present. One of the Company’s directors, Mr. Jun Tong holds 30% ownership of Shanghai Haozong. Currently, we have substantial dependence Shanghai Haozong due to our business strategy.
Competition
 
According to the statistics of the Automobile Industry Branch of the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, the 33 major automobile rubber sealing strip manufacturers that participated in the statistics in 2020, the scope of supporting cooperation covers almost all automobile manufacturers in China and all automobile manufacturers including passenger cars and commercial vehicles. In 2020, the rubber sealing strip industry achieved a sales income of about 15.53 billion Chinese yuan, of which main business candidates of the industry accounted for about 95% of the market share.
 
There is significant competition for the rubber sealing strip industry in the PRC. Many of our competitors are probably larger than we are and can devote more resources than we can do to the manufacture, distribution and sale of the rubber sealing strip. In order to successfully compete in our industry, we will need to:
 

● | Expand our customers basis and strive for additional orders; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Raise funds to support our operations and expand our capacities; 
● | Recruit talent to explore high technology; and 
● | That we provide outstanding product quality, customer service and rigid integrity in our business dealings. 

 
However, there can be no assurance that even if we do these things we will be able to compete effectively with the other companies in our industry. We believe that we have the required management expertise in the rubber sealing strip industry with good development potential and affordable price.
