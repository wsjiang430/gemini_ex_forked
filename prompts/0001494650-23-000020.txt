ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Our Company
We are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of products for patients treated by ear, nose and throat (ENT) and allergy specialists. Our first commercial product, XHANCE® (fluticasone propionate) nasal spray, 93 microgram (mcg), is a therapeutic utilizing our proprietary Exhalation Delivery System™ (EDS®) that delivers a topically-acting corticosteroid for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and, if approved, chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (also known as chronic sinusitis). Chronic rhinosinusitis is a serious nasal inflammatory disease that is treated using therapies, such as intranasal steroids (INS), which have significant limitations. We believe XHANCE has a differentiated clinical profile with the potential to become part of the standard of care for this disease because it is able to deliver medication to the primary site of inflammation high and deep in the nasal passages in regions not adequately reached by conventional INS.
In September 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved XHANCE for the treatment of nasal polyps in patients 18 years of age or older. XHANCE was made widely available through commercial channels in April 2018.
We completed two Phase 3b clinical trials of XHANCE for a follow-on indication for the treatment of chronic sinusitis. Positive top-line results from the trials (which we refer to as ReOpen1 and ReOpen2) were announced in March and 
Table of Contents

June 2022, respectively. In September 2022, we met with FDA to discuss our planned supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for XHANCE as a treatment for adults with chronic sinusitis and submitted the application in February 2023. Assuming the FDA's acceptance of the sNDA submission and a standard review period, we expect the FDA's target action date to be in December 2023. If the sNDA is approved, XHANCE has the potential to be the first drug therapy approved by the FDA for the treatment of chronic sinusitis.
The Unmet Need
Chronic rhinosinusitis is a serious nasal inflammatory disease characterized by chronic inflammation affecting tissues high and deep in the nasal passages, including the area where the openings from the sinuses normally ventilate and drain. This disease significantly impacts the quality of life and daily functioning of an estimated 30 million adults in the U.S. The U.S. healthcare system spends approximately $60 billion annually in direct costs treating patients with chronic rhinosinusitis and its associated symptoms, including an estimated $5 billion on sinus surgeries. In the U.S., physicians perform over 500,000 sinus surgeries each year, and we estimate that as of 2017, over seven million adults had undergone sinus surgery to treat chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps.
In medical literature and medical practice, chronic rhinosinusitis is commonly divided into two subgroups: chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps. Chronic rhinosinusitis patients with and without nasal polyps suffer from chronic inflammation of the lining of the deep nasal passages and sinuses. Patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps also develop non-cancerous polyps on these chronically inflamed surfaces, typically originating in the deep crevices or sinus cavities on both sides of the nose. We estimate that up to 10 million adults in the U.S. have chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.
Both subgroups of chronic rhinosinusitis share the same four defining diagnostic symptoms: nasal congestion/obstruction; facial pain and pressure; purulent runny nose and postnasal drip; and loss of sense of smell and taste. Additional symptoms may include headaches, chronic sleep problems, fatigue, frequent episodes of acute rhinosinusitis and mood disorders. There is evidence suggesting that the harm to a sufferer's quality of life from chronic rhinosinusitis, as measured in multiple domains, such as bodily pain, social functioning and mental health, is comparable to or worse than other serious diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure and angina. As a result, many patients eventually seek surgery for symptom relief.
Although the term chronic rhinosinusitis is often used in medical literature and medical practice, the FDA did not historically recognize chronic rhinosinusitis as an indication for drug development purposes. Instead, the FDA recognized chronic sinusitis and nasal polyps as indications for drug development purposes rather than the terminology chronic rhinosinusitis with or without nasal polyps. Recently, the FDA has approved drug products for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and issued a guidance document in November 2021 for clinical trial programs for nasal polyps in which it adopted the different terminology “treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps” to replace the terminology “treatment of nasal polyps.” Subsequent to issuance of that guidance, FDA requested that previously approved labels for multiple drugs, including XHANCE, with an indication for “treatment of nasal polyps” be changed to reflect the new terminology, and accordingly the XHANCE indication was changed from “nasal polyps” to “chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.” This modification is the result of a change in terminology and was not based on new XHANCE clinical trial data. As a result of the FDA's evolving view on the terminology to be applied to what was historically labeled “chronic sinusitis” and “nasal polyps”, it is uncertain whether the phase 3 clinical trial program that we conducted for XHANCE will, if approved, result in an additional indication using the language “for the treatment of chronic sinusitis”, “for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis”, “for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps”, or other similar language. It is our view that these variations in terminology are synonymous from a promotional perspective and that all are distinct from XHANCE's current indication. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we use the terms "chronic sinusitis" and "chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps" as being synonymous.

Limitations of Therapies
Multiple clinical practice guidelines specify the use of INS early in the treatment algorithm for chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps. Steroids are generally pharmacologically effective at treating inflammation. However, conventional INS, including nasal sprays and nasal aerosols, are topically-acting and unable to effectively and consistently place the steroids onto the primary site of inflammation and nasal polyp origin, high and deep in the nasal passages. These products deposit a majority of the drug in the front of the nose or on the floor of the nasal passages, reducing their effectiveness and leaving many patients without sufficient symptomatic relief. These recognized limitations cause some physicians to seek out alternative treatment regimens such as high-volume steroid nasal rinses. This approach, however, has not been well studied, is difficult to administer, can be costly and may risk systemic side effects. Physicians may also prescribe oral steroids on an episodic basis to patients who have not received sufficient symptomatic relief from INS. Oral steroids, which are often effective in reducing inflammation and nasal polyps, offer only temporary benefit and are limited by the risk of significant systemic side effects associated with both short- and long-term use. Additionally, in June 2019, December 2020, and July 2021, the FDA approved the first three monoclonal antibodies as add-on maintenance treatments (to an INS) in adult patients with inadequately controlled chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, and other monoclonal antibodies are in development. The cost of currently approved monoclonal antibodies range from approximately $33,000 to $47,000 per year. We believe the high costs of these monoclonal antibodies, the need for subcutaneous injection or intravenous administration and the systemic nature of these treatments, which target components of the immune response, may limit the use by certain physicians and patients.
In cases where patients remain symptomatic despite medical management, physicians often recommend various forms of sinus surgery to help restore normal sinus ventilation or drainage. The effectiveness of sinus surgery can vary significantly, many patients experience persistent or recurrent symptoms, and surgery may not address the underlying cause of inflammation. In patients with nasal polyps, regrowth of the nasal polyps has been reported in as high as 60% of cases within four years. In addition, it has been reported that up to 80% of patients continue to have symptoms within two years of surgery. Because sinus surgery is often not curative and may not address the underlying cause of the inflammation, many patients continue to receive short- and long-term courses of INS after surgery.
Our Solution
XHANCE combines the EDS with a liquid formulation of fluticasone propionate, a well-characterized, second-generation corticosteroid. XHANCE is designed to deliver medication into the high and deep regions of the nasal passages where both nasal polyps and inflamed and swollen membranes can obstruct normal sinus ventilation and drainage. In multiple studies utilizing advanced imaging, the EDS produced a differentiated pattern of drug delivery in healthy subjects with significant drug deposited in the high and deep regions of the nasal passages, areas not well accessed by conventional INS delivery mechanisms. We believe XHANCE has the potential to become part of the standard of care for the treatment of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis before they progress to more costly treatment alternatives. We also believe that the current treatment practice of postoperative INS use could support XHANCE's adoption as a maintenance therapy to improve outcomes following sinus surgery.
To support FDA approval of XHANCE as a treatment for nasal polyps, we conducted five clinical trials evaluating over 1,500 adult patients, including two randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 3 pivotal clinical trials in adults with nasal polyps and two supportive open-label Phase 3 clinical trials in adults with symptoms of chronic sinusitis with or without nasal polyps. In both Phase 3 pivotal clinical trials, patients treated with XHANCE experienced statistically significant reductions of both nasal congestion/obstruction symptoms and total polyp grade, which were the co-primary endpoints. Treatment benefits were also observed in all four defining symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis, as well as in polyp elimination (reduction of polyp to grade 0), quality of life measures, need for sinus surgery based on study-defined criteria and patient global impression of change. In addition, the magnitude of improvement for patients treated by XHANCE in our Phase 3 pivotal clinical trials, as measured by the Sinonasal Outcome Test-22, a validated clinical outcome assessment, was comparable to the reported benefits in third-party studies of endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) and balloon sinus dilation. In our supportive open-label Phase 3 clinical trials, which evaluated approximately 900 patients with symptoms of chronic sinusitis with and without nasal polyps for a period of up to one year, XHANCE was generally well tolerated and produced results on efficacy measures similar to those observed in our Phase 3 pivotal clinical trials. In these supportive trials, we observed comparable symptom improvements in patients with and without nasal polyps and continuing incremental polyp reduction and symptom improvement through 12 months. XHANCE had an adverse event profile generally comparable to the profile reported in similarly designed trials with conventional INS. The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 3%) are epistaxis, nasal septal ulceration, nasopharyngitis, nasal mucosal erythema, nasal mucosal ulcerations, nasal congestion, acute sinusitis, nasal septal erythema, headache, and pharyngitis.

We believe XHANCE offers a cost-effective treatment solution to payors who are increasingly being asked to pay for multiple high-cost therapies for a variety of diseases priced at tens of thousands of dollars per year. As of January 1, 2023, the wholesale acquisition cost for XHANCE was $596.97. XHANCE is priced significantly higher than low cost generic INS and over-the-counter (OTC) INS products.
We expect XHANCE to be adopted by physicians at a natural point in the care pathway for use in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with or without nasal polyps after treatment failure with cheaper generic or OTC traditional INS therapies but before they progress to costly surgical interventions and monoclonal antibodies. We estimate that sinus surgery costs on average $13,500 per procedure, and monoclonal antibodies cost approximately $33,000 to $47,000 per year based on the wholesale acquisition cost and recommended dosing for XOLAIR™ (omalizumab), NUCALA™ (mepolizumab), and DUPIXENT™ (dupilumab). 
U.S. Market Opportunity
We believe there is a market opportunity for XHANCE consisting of ENT physicians, allergists and primary care physicians in the U.S. that most frequently prescribe INS. This group of approximately 5,000 primary care physicians, which we refer to as "specialty-like" primary care physicians, account for approximately 25% of all INS prescriptions written by primary care physicians. We refer to these ENT physicians, allergists and high-decile INS-prescribing primary care physicians collectively as the "specialty segment" of our target market. We believe the approximately 15,000 physicians in this specialty segment together treat an estimated 3.5 million U.S. patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, an estimated 1.2 million of whom have chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. We believe the total annual U.S. market opportunity for XHANCE in this specialty segment is over $3.4 billion, of which approximately one-third consists of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. If we obtain approval for the follow-on indication of chronic sinusitis, we intend to broaden, through potential collaborations, our commercialization efforts to target additional primary care physicians that we believe treat an additional estimated 6.25 million U.S. patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, an estimated one-third of whom have chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. We refer to these additional primary care physicians as the "primary care segment" of our target market. We believe the total additional annual U.S. market opportunity for XHANCE in this primary care segment is over $6.0 billion, of which approximately one-third consists of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. Therefore, we estimate the total annual U.S. market opportunity for the combined specialty and primary care segments is over $9.5 billion, of which approximately one-third consists of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.
Intellectual Property and Barriers to Entry
XHANCE benefits from substantial intellectual property and other technical barriers to entry, including drug delivery complexities. Our XHANCE U.S. patent portfolio consists of 13 issued device and method of use patents expiring on various dates from 2023 through 2036 and three issued design patents expiring through 2030, as well as pending patent applications. The 13 issued device and method of use patents are published in the FDA's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book.
We believe the unique features of the EDS, as well as its delivery of a topically-acting drug, will present generic and 505(b)(2) new drug application (NDA) competitors of XHANCE with technical and human factors engineering challenges specific to drug-device combination products and chemistry, manufacturing and controls challenges unique to suspension and respiratory products. We also believe that any future substitutable generic competitors may be required to conduct, among other things, non-inferiority clinical trials demonstrating equivalent efficacy and safety outcomes to establish clinical bioequivalence to XHANCE. We believe these clinical trials, if required, would necessitate a significant amount of time and capital investment and present clinical development uncertainties. However, XHANCE is referenced on the list of product specific guidances for complex generic drug products that the FDA plans to issue, which may provide clarity for generic competitors to develop generic products that compete with XHANCE.
Our Growth Strategy
Our goal is to become a leading specialty pharmaceutical company dedicated to developing proprietary products that become a part of the standard of care for diseases in the ENT and allergy segments. The key elements of our strategy are to:
•Continue to commercialize XHANCE in the ENT and allergy specialty segments in the U.S. We believe that approximately 15,000 targeted physicians treat an estimated 3.5 million chronic rhinosinusitis patients, an estimated 1.2 million of whom have chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. We have a sales 
Table of Contents

force of approximately 77 territory managers who target approximately 7,000 ENT and allergy specialists and "specialty-like" primary care physicians. 
▪Seek regulatory approval of XHANCE for the treatment of chronic sinusitis and expansion into the primary care segment to broaden our market opportunity. We completed two Phase 3b clinical trials in pursuit of a follow-on indication for XHANCE for the treatment of chronic sinusitis. We announced positive top-line results from these trials in March and June 2022 and believe XHANCE has the potential to be the first drug therapy approved by the FDA for the treatment of chronic sinusitis. In addition to increasing the number of patients for whom the product can be promoted within the currently targeted physician segment, we believe approval of the new indication by FDA could be a catalyst for us to enter into one or more collaborations to broaden the marketing of XHANCE to additional primary care physicians that we believe treat an additional estimated 6.25 million patients in the U.S. with chronic rhinosinusitis, an estimated two-thirds of whom have chronic sinusitis but do not have nasal polyps. In addition, at some point in the future, we, together with any potential partner secured for the primary care segment, intend to consider directing promotional resources to an additional estimated 20 million adult chronic rhinosinusitis sufferers who are not regularly under the care of physicians for this disease using programs such as direct-to-consumer and direct-to-patient promotion.
▪Seek additional development candidates or approved therapies focused on the ENT and allergy specialty segments. We continue to evaluate strategic licensing, acquisition, development and commercial partnerships. These targeted opportunities could increase our growth and leverage our existing infrastructure and capabilities. 
▪Explore business development activities for the EDS outside of the ENT and allergy segments. We evaluate potential opportunities for additional uses of the EDS to support development and commercialization outside of ENT and allergy. We currently have two agreements in place that include an out-license of the EDS and related technology. In January 2019, OptiNose AS, our wholly-owned subsidiary, completed a licensing agreement with Inexia Limited (now Orexia Therapeutics, a subsidiary of Centessa Pharmaceuticals, a novel asset-centric pharmaceutical company) (the Centessa License Agreement). Pursuant to the terms of the Centessa License Agreement, we granted Orexia an exclusive license to the EDS and related intellectual property for the research, development and commercialization of products containing orexin receptor agonist and/or orexin receptor positive modulator molecules. In September 2019, OptiNose AS, entered into a licensing agreement (Currax License Agreement) with Currax Pharmaceuticals LLC (Currax) whereby we granted Currax an exclusive license to certain OptiNose patents and a non-exclusive license to certain OptiNose know-how related to Onzetra® Xsail® (sumatriptan nasal powder) in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. 
▪Expand XHANCE into international markets. We intend to remain opportunistic in pursuit of select international opportunities in order to maximize the commercial potential and the availability of XHANCE to patients.
Chronic Rhinosinusitis and Market Opportunity
Chronic Rhinosinusitis
Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a serious nasal inflammatory disease significantly impacting patients' quality of life and daily functioning. CRS, unlike allergic rhinitis, is characterized by chronic inflammation affecting tissues high and deep in the nasal passages, including the area where the openings from the sinuses normally ventilate and drain, causing symptoms that persist for a period of 8 to 12 weeks or longer. CRS patients typically suffer from these symptoms four to six months a year, with symptoms often persisting for many years.
In medical literature and medical practice, CRS is commonly divided into two subgroups: CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and CRS without nasal polyps (CRSsNP). CRS patients with and without nasal polyps suffer from chronic inflammation of the lining of the deep nasal passages and sinuses. Patients with CRSwNP also develop non-cancerous polyps on these chronically inflamed surfaces, typically originating in the deep crevices or sinus cavities on both sides of the nose. We estimate that up to 10 million adults in the U.S. have CRSwNP. Both subgroups of CRS share the same four defining diagnostic symptoms: (1) nasal congestion/obstruction; (2) facial pain and pressure; (3) purulent runny nose, and postnasal drip; and (4) loss of sense of smell and taste. Additional symptoms may include headaches, chronic sleep problems, fatigue, frequent episodes of acute rhinosinusitis and mood disorders. There is evidence suggesting that the harm to a sufferer's quality of life from CRS, as measured in multiple domains, such as bodily pain, social functioning and mental health, is comparable to or worse than other 
Table of Contents

serious diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure and angina. As a result, many patients eventually seek surgery for symptom relief.
The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery estimates that approximately 30 million adults in the U.S. have CRS, and it is estimated that up to 10 million adults have CRSwNP. CRS imposes a significant healthcare burden on insurers and employers. It has been reported that the U.S. healthcare system spends approximately $60 billion annually in direct costs treating patients with CRS and its associated symptoms, including an estimated $5 billion on sinus surgeries. In the U.S., physicians perform over 500,000 sinus surgeries each year, and we estimate that as of 2017, over seven million adults had undergone sinus surgery to treat CRS with and without nasal polyps. CRS has been reported to account for an aggregate of 73 million restricted activity days per year. Additionally, people with CRS have been reported to be absent from work because of this disease 6.5% of the time and to suffer a 38% loss of productivity.
U.S. Market Opportunity
We estimate that approximately 9.75 million CRS patients are currently being treated in physician offices in the U.S. We derived this estimate from a large patient claims database that reflects actual treatment patterns of CRS over a two-year period from 2010 to 2012. We also estimate that approximately 10,000 ENT and allergy specialists, as well as approximately 5,000 "specialty-like" primary care physicians, treat approximately 36% of all CRS patients in the U.S., or approximately 3.5 million patients, an estimated 1.2 million of whom have CRSwNP. In accordance with multiple published clinical practice guidelines, physicians typically medically manage CRS patients by prescribing INS despite the fact that there are no FDA-approved products for the treatment of CRSsNP. 
If we obtain FDA approval for the follow-on indication for the treatment of chronic sinusitis (CS), we intend to broaden, through potential collaborations, our marketing outreach to additional primary care physicians that treat an additional estimated 6.25 million U.S. patients with CRS, an estimated one-third of whom have CRSwNP. We expect to execute this expansion primarily through one or more collaborations with third parties that already have a sales force calling on primary care physicians. We may also direct promotional resources to an additional estimated 20 million CRS sufferers who are not regularly under the care of physicians for this disease using programs such as direct-to-consumer and direct-to-patient promotion. 
Based on internal estimates, we believe the total annual U.S. market opportunity for XHANCE in the specialty segment is over $3.4 billion, of which approximately one-third consists of patients with CRSwNP. Based on these same estimates, we believe the total additional annual U.S. market opportunity for XHANCE in the primary care segment is over $6.0 billion, of which approximately one-third consists of patients with CRSwNP. Therefore, we estimate the total annual U.S. market opportunity for the combined specialty and primary care segments is over $9.5 billion, of which approximately one-third consists of patients with CRSwNP.
Treatment Landscape
The treatment of CRS with and without nasal polyps typically begins with medical management. In cases where patients remain symptomatic despite medical management, physicians often recommend various forms of sinus surgery to help restore normal sinus ventilation and drainage. The following is a brief description of the current treatment landscape and product candidates in development for CRS with and without nasal polyps:
Current Therapies
▪Intranasal Steroids. Multiple published clinical practice guidelines generally recommend topically-acting INS as the first line of prescription therapy for the treatment of CRS with and without polyps. As a result, physicians typically prescribe INS nasal sprays or nasal aerosols despite the fact that there are no FDA-approved products for the treatment of CRSsNP. Therefore, the majority of chronic rhinosinusitis sufferers being treated have tried INS. We estimate that physicians in the U.S. prescribe approximately 17 million INS prescriptions each year for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis, which includes, among other INS products, a generic fluticasone propionate nasal spray. The only other branded INS to receive an indication for the treatment of nasal polyps is Nasonex™, which was marketed by Merck & Co., Inc. before being removed from the prescription market but is available over-the-counter without a prescription for other indications. Generic versions of Nasonex™, mometasone furoate monohydrate, remain available as prescription drugs. Physicians not only prescribe INS as a standalone therapy, but also typically prescribe INS following sinus surgery as some third-party clinical trials suggest that INS treatment can improve symptoms and delay symptom recurrence. In lieu of prescription INS nasal sprays, physicians may recommend use of over-the-counter INS nasal sprays including over-the-counter products containing fluticasone propionate and mometasone furoate monohydrate. 
Table of Contents

▪Oral steroids. Physicians may prescribe oral steroids on an episodic basis to patients who have not received sufficient symptomatic relief from INS. Oral steroids are often effective at treating the underlying inflammation associated with the disease and reducing postoperative scarring, but the benefit is temporary. As inflammation returns, many patients resume INS therapy.
▪Monoclonal antibodies. In June 2019, the FDA approved DUPIXENT™ as an add-on (to an INS) maintenance treatment in adult patients with inadequately controlled chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis. In November 2020, the FDA approved XOLAIR™ add-on maintenance treatment of nasal polyps in adult patients with inadequate response to nasal corticosteroids. In July 2021, the FDA approved NUCALA™ add-on maintenance treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps in adult patients with inadequate response to nasal corticosteroids. In addition, these monoclonal antibodies are being, or are expected to be, studied as potential treatments for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps.
▪Other medical management. Physicians commonly employ a variety of other non-surgical treatments in the medical management of chronic rhinosinusitis, including nasal saline rinses, multi-week courses of antibiotics, leukotriene antagonists, decongestants, aspirin desensitization and antifungals. The recognized limitations of drug deposition with current INS cause some physicians to seek out alternative treatment regimens, such as high doses of locally compounded liquid budesonide in high-volume nasal rinses. Chronic rhinosinusitis is one of the most common reasons for adult outpatient antibiotic use in the U.S., comprised of approximately 37 million prescriptions per year.
▪Sinus surgery and other procedures. Physicians generally recommend surgical treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps only after patients fail medical management. The primary surgical alternative is Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (ESS), which attempts to open the sinus drainage pathways while preserving as much bone and sinus tissue lining as possible. The physician typically uses rigid steel instruments and powered cutting tools to remove inflamed tissue, including any nasal polyps, and underlying bone and cartilage to create a larger passage through the nasal anatomy to the sinuses. At the conclusion of the procedure, patients often have their nasal passages packed with a material that acts as a spacer to prevent surgical adhesions and control bleeding. Patients typically require one or more follow-up debridement treatments in which the physician may remove more tissue, crusting, scabs or scar tissue at the area of surgery in order to keep the sinus drainage pathway open and promote proper healing.
Several companies have developed less invasive technologies for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis since the introduction of ESS, such as balloon sinus dilation devices and steroid-releasing sinus implants. Balloon sinus dilation employs a high pressure inflated balloon to open blocked sinus pathways to increase ventilation and mucus drainage. Steroid-releasing sinus implants are used to hold open the surgically enlarged sinus, while releasing a steroid over a period of time in order to reduce postoperative sinus inflammation and scarring. SINUVA® (mometasone furoate) sinus implant is a commercially available corticosteroid-eluting implant indicated for the treatment of nasal polyps in adult patients who have had ethmoid sinus surgery that can be placed in the ethmoid sinus under endoscopic visualization for up to 90 days. In the SINUVA clinical studies, patients were advised to use nasal steroid sprays and sinus rinses for the duration of the study.
Potential Future Therapies
Additional potential future therapies include but are not limited to monoclonal antibodies, and corticosteroid-eluting implants. Benralizumab, which is already approved for other indications, is being developed for the treatment of nasal polyps, and is believed to inhibit specific pathways of inflammation present in nasal polyps. Lyra Therapeutics is developing corticosteroid-eluting implants as potential treatment for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. 
Limitations of Therapies
The current and potential future therapies to treat patients suffering from chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps have a number of limitations, including:
▪Limited efficacy of INS treatments using traditional nasal sprays and nasal aerosols.  Although steroids are generally pharmacologically effective, conventional INS, including nasal sprays and nasal aerosols, are unable to effectively and consistently place the steroids onto the primary site of inflammation and nasal polyp origin, high and deep in the nasal passages. These products deposit a majority of the drug in the front of the nose or on the floor of the nasal passages, reducing their effectiveness and leaving many patients without sufficient symptomatic relief.
Table of Contents

▪Short-term benefits of oral steroids outweighed by significant side effects.  Oral steroids offer only temporary benefit and are limited by the risk of significant systemic side effects associated with both short- and long-term use. These side effects include, among others, weight gain; increased risk of infections; loss of bone mineral density; death of bone tissue; cataract formation; glaucoma; adrenal suppression; and psychiatric complications, including mania, depression, and psychosis.
▪Varying degrees of efficacy with other medical management.  Other non-surgical treatments have varying degrees of supporting data and efficacy. In addition, high-volume steroid nasal rinses are difficult to administer, can be costly, may risk systemic side effects due to the absorption of the steroid into the body, can be associated with fluid draining from the nose after the procedure and are difficult for patients to comply with over prolonged courses of outpatient therapy.
▪Sinus surgery and other procedures are costly and may not be a complete solution.  The effectiveness of sinus surgery varies significantly and many patients experience persistent or recurrent symptoms. Reports indicate that nasal polyp regrowth following surgery occurs in as high as 60% of cases within four years. In addition, it has been reported that up to 80% of patients continued to have symptoms within two years of surgery. Because sinus surgery is often not curative and may not address the underlying cause of the inflammation, many patients receive short- and long-term courses of INS after surgery and approximately 20% of patients elect surgical revisions. Postoperative scarring and persistent inflammation are common and can compromise symptom outcomes and also negatively impact the ability of the sinuses to heal. Sinus surgery is also a costly procedure, with estimated costs on average $13,500 per procedure. While balloon sinus dilation has the ability to open sinuses in a less invasive manner, it also may not address the underlying cause of the inflammation associated with chronic rhinosinusitis and is costly. Similarly, steroid-releasing sinus implants have limited duration of anti-inflammatory effect, are costly and face reimbursement challenges.
▪Treatment with monoclonal antibodies is costly, difficult to administer and may have negative side effects. The current FDA-approved monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of nasal polyps cost approximately $33,000 to $47,000 per year. Monoclonal antibodies also require subcutaneous injections or intravenous administration. We believe the systemic nature of these treatments, which target components of the immune response, may result in more adverse side effects than treatments with topically-acting steroids.
Our Solution
XHANCE
XHANCE combines the EDS with a liquid formulation of fluticasone propionate, a potent, well-characterized, second-generation anti-inflammatory corticosteroid for the treatment of serious nasal diseases characterized by chronic inflammation, such as chronic rhinosinusitis. XHANCE is designed to deliver fluticasone propionate into the high and deep regions of the nasal passages where nasal polyps or inflamed and swollen membranes can obstruct normal sinus ventilation and drainage. 
In September 2017, the FDA approved our NDA for XHANCE for the treatment of nasal polyps in patients 18 years of age or older. In January 2023, the indication statement for XHANCE was changed from “for the treatment of nasal polyps” to “for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps” to reflect current FDA labeling terminology and not based on new XHANCE clinical data.
In March and June 2022, we announced positive top line results from our two Phase 3b clinical trials in of XHANCE for a follow-on indication for the treatment of chronic sinusitis. In February 2023, we submitted a prior approval efficacy supplement (sNDA) to support the approval of a new indication for XHANCE for the treatment of chronic sinusitis. Assuming the FDA's acceptance of the sNDA submission and a standard review period, we expect the FDA's target action date to be in December 2023. If the sNDA is approved, XHANCE has the potential to be the first drug therapy approved by the FDA for the treatment of chronic sinusitis.
We believe XHANCE could become a part of the standard of care for the treatment of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps before they progress to more costly treatment alternatives and could also be adopted as a maintenance therapy to improve outcomes following sinus surgery.
The Exhalation Delivery System (EDS)
The EDS enables the development of drug-device combination products intended for self-administration. We have developed both a liquid delivery EDS and a powder delivery EDS utilizing natural functional behaviors of the upper 
Table of Contents

nasal airways intended to offer better drug deposition. The EDS is designed to overcome many limitations inherent in conventional nasal spray and nasal aerosol delivery systems, most notably, enabling higher and deeper intranasal drug delivery.
Liquid Exhalation Delivery System 
The liquid EDS depicted below, which is the EDS used in XHANCE, consists of the primary drug container for the liquid drug formulation, an amber glass vial sealed by a crimp-fitted metering spray pump, enclosed within a proprietary liquid delivery subassembly. The nasal spray applicator, which is a component of the subassembly, is attached to the pump and extends to the top of the nosepiece of the liquid delivery subassembly. The EDS includes a flexible mouthpiece and an asymmetrically-shaped nosepiece, covered by an orange cap, as part of a mechanism that uses the patient's exhaled breath to naturally seal closed the soft palate and to facilitate delivery of drug to the nasal passages through the sealing nosepiece. The nosepiece is designed to create a seal with the nostril and also to expand and stent the upper part of the nasal valve, which is an important anatomical structure that is the narrowest part of the entire respiratory tract and a barrier that causes most medication delivered by conventional INS to deposit in the front part of the nose.
Powder Exhalation Delivery System 
The powder EDS depicted below, which is the EDS used in Onzetra® Xsail®, consists of a reusable device body incorporating a flexible mouthpiece to adjust to individual anatomic variations, and a white button piercing assembly to pierce the medication capsule. Disposable nosepieces are provided in a foil pouch to be inserted into the drug delivery device body. Each pre-filled nosepiece section contains a medication capsule containing a dry powder formulation and a clear release tab. The capsule is pierced by pressing and releasing the white button piercing assembly. The flexible mouthpiece and an asymmetrically-shaped nosepiece are part of the mechanism that uses the patient's exhaled breath to naturally seal closed the soft palate and to facilitate delivery of drug to the nasal passages through the sealing nosepiece. The medication capsule is intended for single dose administration and is not refillable or removable from the nosepiece.
Following drug administration, the disposable nosepiece, including the dose-expended medication capsule, is then removed and discarded.

How the Exhalation Delivery System (EDS) works
When exhaling into the EDS, the soft palate automatically elevates and creates an air-tight seal separating the nasal cavity from the throat and lungs. This natural action is the same as that which prevents air from escaping from the nose when trying to blow up a balloon or blow a trumpet. The exhaled air is then routed through the EDS which introduces medication into the air flow and then directs the air and medication through the sealing nosepiece. The positive air pressure, which is the opposite of the negative pressure produced by sniffing with ordinary nasal sprays, acts to dynamically expand the nasal valve and the narrowed nasal passages, helping to deliver the drug around obstructing anatomic barriers and fill one side of the nasal cavity. This enables high and deep deposition of medication in the nasal passages. The positive air pressure, proportional to the pressure on the other side of the soft palate, helps to open a passage between the two sides of the nasal cavity, behind the back edge of the nasal septum. The picture below illustrates this action, which allows the exhaled air pressure to escape from the opposite nostril.
The drug delivery mechanism of the EDS is designed to overcome the drug deposition shortcomings of conventional nasal sprays and nasal aerosols. In conventional nasal sprays and nasal aerosols, the medication is inhaled or sniffed into the nose creating negative pressure within the nasal passages, which does not facilitate the 
Table of Contents

expansion of the nasal valve or the nasal passages and may obstruct the drug from reaching deep into the nose where most nasal polyps and inflamed and swollen sinus membranes exist.
The pattern of drug deposition produced by conventional nasal sprays and the EDS has been evaluated in multiple studies using a combination of advanced imaging modalities to depict the regions of the nasal passages where drug is deposited after administration in healthy human volunteers. In an open label, crossover study conducted by a third party in nine patients with allergic rhinitis, investigators examined the nasal deposition of radio-labeled materials that allow for traceability following use of Qnasl™ (HFA-beclomethasone, nasal aerosol), Flonase™ (fluticasone propionate, nasal spray) and Nasonex™ (mometasone furoate monohydrate, nasal spray). In this study, gamma cameras were used to capture emitted radiation from these tracers to create two-dimensional images in a similar process to the capture of x-ray images. These gamma images were merged with magnetic resonance images (MRI) to quantify regional deposition within the nasal passages. The images below illustrate how the pattern of drug deposition in the nasal passages produced by Qnasl™, Flonase™ and Nasonex™ was concentrated in the front and lower regions of the nasal passages, as opposed to the high and deep regions of the nasal passages targeted in the treatment of CRS.

We conducted six deposition studies evaluating 53 healthy subjects that produced approximately 250 images. As depicted in the representative figures below, the EDS produced a differentiated pattern of drug delivery with significantly more drug deposited in the high and deep regions of the nasal passages.
The pictures above use gamma camera image information, which was then superimposed on the corresponding MRI section. These images represent deposition in healthy subjects two minutes after delivery using a traditional liquid nasal spray and a version of the liquid EDS. Deposition with traditional liquid nasal spray was greatest in the front parts of the nose, whereas deposition with the EDS was greatest in the high and deep regions of the nose.
The pictures below illustrate how the liquid EDS (with exhalation) places medication higher and deeper in the nasal passages than a conventional nasal spray (without sniffing) in nasal cast models. As depicted below, although conventional nasal spray systems can reach, and therefore treat, large nasal polyps, they are not generally suitable

for reaching nasal polyps or inflammation in the higher and deeper regions where obstruction of the sinus openings occurs.
The liquid EDS is also designed to address user dissatisfaction with conventional nasal delivery by reducing drug drip-out from the front and back of the nose and the bad taste that often accompanies drug entering the throat. By reducing the loss of drug to non-targeted sites, such as the gastrointestinal tract by swallowing, or lungs, the EDS has the potential to improve the efficiency of drug activity and to improve tolerability by reducing off-target effects.
Our Pipeline
XHANCE for Chronic Sinusitis
In addition to XHANCE’s existing indication for the treatment of nasal polyps, in order to broaden our U.S. market opportunity, we conducted a clinical trial program in pursuit of a follow-on indication for the treatment of CS in the U.S. We announced positive top-line results from the clinical trials in March and June 2022 and submitted a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) in February 2023. Assuming the FDA's acceptance of the sNDA submission and a standard review period, we expect the FDA's target action date to be in December 2023. If the sNDA is approved, XHANCE has the potential to be the first drug therapy approved by the FDA for the treatment of chronic sinusitis.
In the future, as appropriate, we intend to broaden, through potential collaborations, our commercialization efforts to additional primary care physicians that we believe treat an additional estimated 6.25 million U.S. patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, an estimated one-third of whom have chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. In addition, at some point in the future, we intend to consider, with a collaboration partner, directing promotional resources to an additional estimated 20 million adults who are not regularly under the care of physicians for this disease using programs such as direct-to-consumer and direct-to-patient promotion.
EDS Technology
We opportunistically evaluate opportunities to develop product candidates using the EDS and related technologies for indications and markets outside of our ENT and allergy focus through business development and partnering activities.Although our current focus is to prioritize the successful commercialization of XHANCE for the ENT and allergy specialty segment and the pursuit of FDA approval of XHANCE for the treatment of chronic sinusitis, we may apply or out-license the EDS and related technology to other product candidates across a broad range of disease areas. For example, by placing drug high and deep in the nose, in regions where cranial nerves connect directly with the brain, we believe it may be possible to deliver medications directly into the brain and avoid the difficulties of getting drug past the blood-brain barrier. This may enable treatment of brain diseases using small or large molecules that otherwise do not readily enter the nervous system.
Sales and Marketing
We have established a commercial infrastructure designed to drive adoption and sales of XHANCE with healthcare professionals who treat patients with nasal polyps. We believe that approximately 15,000 physicians treat an estimated 3.5 million chronic rhinosinusitis patients, an estimated 1.2 million of whom have chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.
Customer Model. At the start of 2022 we had a sales force of approximately 90 territory managers who targeted over 10,000 ENTs, allergists and “specialty-like” primary care physicians. At the end of 2022 we had reduced the size of our sales force to approximately 77 territory managers, as part of actions intended to reduce our operating expenses, who target approximately 7,000 ENTs, allergists and “specialty-like” primary care physicians. In addition 
Table of Contents

to in-person promotion by our territory managers we target additional physicians through digital and non-personal promotion in areas where we do and do not have territory managers. 
Our sales team is equipped with educational materials demonstrating the benefit and safety profile of XHANCE. In the future, particularly after receipt of a potential future new indication for the treatment of chronic sinusitis, we may increase the number of geographic territories as well as hire additional territory managers in order to increase the number of called-on target physicians and frequency of calls. We believe that in the long term, direct to consumer (DTC) advertising could be an effective way to increase XHANCE prescription growth.
XHANCE Co-Pay Savings Program. We believe our co-pay savings program provides an affordability solution for patients that physicians will support. This program provides patient co-pay assistance to eligible commercially insured patients. These patients may obtain XHANCE for as little as $0 out-of-pocket. 
Market Access. Based on currently available third-party data and our internal analyses as of December 31, 2022, we believe that approximately 80% of commercially insured lives are currently in a plan that covers XHANCE. However, payors may change coverage levels for XHANCE, positively or negatively, at any time. Additionally, payors generally impose restrictions on access to or usage of XHANCE, such as by requiring prior authorizations or "step-edits". For example, insurers may require that a physician attest that they are treating a patient for an approved indication prior to becoming eligible for coverage for XHANCE. Approximately half of the commercially covered lives as of December 31, 2022 are in a plan that requires a prior authorization and most of those prior authorizations request information regarding prior use of INS and patient diagnosis. In some cases, patients do not meet the payors' utilization management criteria, and in other cases, healthcare providers may not complete the administrative process required to demonstrate or document that the patients for whom XHANCE has been prescribed meet the payors’ utilization management criteria (i.e., prior authorizations or step-edits) and, as a result, patients may not gain access to XHANCE treatment. In our contract negotiations with payors we seek to balance patient access and affordability, breadth of coverage, payor utilization management and rebates levels. We have also contracted with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for coverage of certain government insured lives and continue to expand XHANCE market access for other government-insured populations.
Trade and Distribution. We currently sell XHANCE primarily to PPN partners. We established this channel to offer patients the option of filling prescriptions through a network of preferred pharmacies that may be able to better serve the needs of patients through services including delivery of XHANCE by mail and performing certain patient services such as patient insurance benefit verification. We also sell XHANCE to wholesale pharmaceutical distributors, who, in turn, sell XHANCE to retail pharmacies, hospitals and other customers. We have contracted with a third-party logistics provider for key services related to logistics, warehousing and inventory management, and distribution. Further, our third-party logistics provider provides customer order fulfillment services and accounts receivable management.
Customers
Approximately 81% of our XHANCE net revenues during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 were to PPN partners. The three leading PPNs accounted for approximately 22% of our XHANCE net revenues. Additionally, approximately 19% of our XHANCE net revenues during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 were to the three largest wholesale pharmaceutical distributors, Cardinal Health, McKesson Corporation, and AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation.
Manufacturing
We contract with third parties for the manufacture, testing and storage of XHANCE. In our experience, contract manufacturers (CMOs) are generally cost-efficient and reliable and therefore we currently have no plans to build our own manufacturing capabilities. Because we rely on CMOs, we employ personnel with extensive technical, manufacturing, analytical and quality experience to oversee contract manufacturing and testing activities, and to compile manufacturing and quality information for our regulatory submissions. Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, and which govern record-keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, among other activities. Our systems and our contractors are required to comply with these regulations, and we assess this compliance regularly through monitoring of performance and a formal audit program. 
We have entered into the following key supply agreements for the commercial manufacture and supply of XHANCE:
▪A supply agreement with Hovione Inter Ltd for the supply of fluticasone propionate, the active pharmaceutical ingredient included in the liquid suspension formulation. This agreement terminates in 
Table of Contents

March 2023, although we are currently in discussions to enter into an extension of the term. We have also been actively pursuing a second source for supply that we anticipate will be online in early 2024. In the event we cannot reach an agreement on an extension, we have existing materials on hand to support production through 2023, and the ability to spot purchase to bridge to a new supplier. 
▪A manufacture and supply agreement with Contract Pharmaceuticals Limited Canada (CPL) for the formulation and assembly of the finished drug product during the fill/pack operation. This agreement was amended and renewed in February 2021 and now terminates on December 31, 2024, subject to earlier termination or extension in accordance with the terms of the agreement. 
•A manufacturing services agreement with Advance Mold & Manufacturing, Inc. for the manufacture of the liquid delivery sub-assembly, which consists of injection molded parts and other purchased components. The agreement expires in October 2023 (subject to earlier termination or extension in accordance with its terms) but will automatically renew for successive one-year terms unless either party provides at least ninety days prior written notice to the other that it does not intend to renew the agreement.
We believe our third-party manufacturers have adequate capacity to manufacture sufficient quantities of XHANCE to meet anticipated commercial demands and we are pursuing opportunities to decrease our reliance on sole-source suppliers and increase the third party manufacturing capacity that is available to us. We have initiated the process of qualifying alternate third party suppliers for select components of XHANCE. Alternate third party suppliers of XHANCE components are subject to qualification and approval from the FDA.
Competition
Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change as research provides a deeper understanding of the pathology of diseases and new technologies and treatments are developed. We believe our scientific knowledge, technology, and development capabilities provide us with substantial competitive advantages, but we face potential competition from multiple sources, including large pharmaceutical, biotechnology, specialty pharmaceutical and, to a lesser degree, medical device companies.
XHANCE competes primarily with INS, oral steroids, monoclonal antibodies and other medical management products, including locally compounded liquid budesonide in high-volume nasal rinses. XHANCE also competes with surgical procedures, balloon sinus dilation products and steroid-releasing sinus implants. Key competitive factors affecting the commercial success of XHANCE and any other product candidates we may develop are likely to be efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of administration, price and reimbursement.
The only other branded INS to receive an indication for the treatment of nasal polyps is Nasonex™, which was marketed by Merck & Co., Inc. before being removed from the prescription market but is available over-the-counter without a prescription for other treatment indications. Generic versions of Nasonex™, mometasone furoate monohydrate, were first approved by the FDA for, among other indications, the treatment of nasal polyps and launched in 2016 and remain available by prescription. Also, Beconase AQ™, which is an INS marketed by GlaxoSmithKline, is indicated for the prophylaxis of nasal polyps after surgical resection. In addition, SINUVA™ is a commercially available corticosteroid-eluting implant indicated for the treatment of nasal polyps in adult patients who have had ethmoid sinus surgery that can be placed in the ethmoid sinus under endoscopic visualization for up to 90 days. In the SINUVA™ clinical studies, patients were advised to use INS and sinus rinses for the duration of the study. Also, Lyra Therapeutics is developing corticosteroid-eluting implants as potential treatment for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. 
There are no products approved for the treatment of chronic sinusitis without nasal polyps. There are two categories of INS: first-generation INS products, which include Rhinocort™, Nasacort AQ™ and Qnasl™; and second-generation INS products, which include Flonase™, Veramyst™, Omnaris™ and Zetonna™. The primary difference between first- and second-generation INS products is that first-generation INS are absorbed into the blood to a greater extent than second-generation INS, with systemic bioavailability ranging from 10% to 50% compared to a systemic bioavailability with fluticasone propionate, a second-generation INS, of less than 2%. Many of the most widely-prescribed INS products are available in generic form and some, such as Flonase™ (which contains fluticasone propionate the same active pharmaceutical ingredient as XHANCE), Nasonex (which contains mometasone furoate monohydrate) and other products containing fluticasone propionate and mometasone furoate monohydrate, are available over-the-counter without a prescription at prices generally ranging from approximately $15-30 per month supply.

Several companies have developed or are currently developing monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of nasal polyps. These monoclonal antibodies, which inhibit specific pathways of inflammation present in nasal polyps, include benralizumab, DUPIXENT™, XOLAIR™, and NUCALA™. In June 2019, the FDA approved DUPIXENT™ as an add-on (to an INS) maintenance treatment in adult patients with inadequately controlled chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis. In November 2020, the FDA approved XOLAIR™ as an add-on maintenance treatment of nasal polyps in adult patients with inadequate response to nasal corticosteroids. In July 2021, the FDA approved NUCALA™ as an add-on maintenance treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps in adult patients with inadequate response to nasal corticosteroids. In addition these monoclonal antibodies are being, or are expected to be, studied as potential treatments for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps. Monoclonal antibodies could represent significant competition for XHANCE.
Seasonality
A seasonal effect has historically been observed in the INS prescription market in which market volume generally peaks near the middle of the second quarter and declines into the early part of the third quarter of each calendar year. Based on third-party prescription data, INS market prescriptions decreased 4% from the fourth quarter of 2020 to the first quarter of 2021, increased 14% from the first quarter of 2021 to the second quarter of 2021, decreased 4% from the second quarter of 2021 to the third quarter of 2021, increased 1% from the third quarter of 2021 to the fourth quarter of 2021, were flat from the fourth quarter of 2021 to the first quarter of 2022, increased 7% from the first quarter of 2022 to the second quarter of 2022, decreased 7% from the second quarter of 2022 to the third quarter of 2022, and increased 4% from the third quarter of 2022 to the fourth quarter of 2022.
Although the underlying disease that we are treating is chronic and causes symptoms year-round, we believe the variation in patient flow through the offices of relevant physician specialists, and seasonality in disease flare-ups, has an impact on the number of patients that present themselves and who are therefore available to receive a new prescription for XHANCE. Demand has historically been, and we expect will continue to be, impacted by the INS market seasonality and the seasonal variation in patient visits with their doctor resulting in reduced XHANCE prescription demand in the third quarter. 
Additionally, as we experienced in 2021 and 2022, we expect that the first quarter prescription demand and average net revenue per prescription for XHANCE will be adversely impacted in 2023 and future years by the annual resetting of patient healthcare insurance plan deductibles and changes in individual patients' healthcare insurance coverage, both of which often occur in January.
XHANCE Clinical Development
Nasal Polyps Program 
Our clinical trial program for nasal polyps evaluated XHANCE in the following five clinical trials comprised of over 1,500 patients:
▪two randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 3 pivotal clinical trials designed to compare the safety and efficacy of XHANCE to a placebo EDS in adults with bilateral nasal polyps, which we refer to as NAVIGATE I and NAVIGATE II or collectively, our pivotal clinical trials. Each of NAVIGATE I and NAVIGATE II had co-primary endpoints of (i) change in subjective nasal congestion/obstruction symptoms from baseline to week 4 and (ii) change in objectively measured total (bilateral) nasal polyp grade from baseline to week 16. These trials also evaluated several secondary endpoints, including the impact of XHANCE treatment on study-defined surgical eligibility criteria and changes in Sinonasal Outcome Test 22 score, which considers the core defining signs and symptoms of nasal polyps and the impact on functioning, quality of life and sleep. We also conducted a complete response analysis to evaluate the percentage of patients with a recorded nasal polyp grade of zero on at least one side of the nasal cavity.
▪two open-label Phase 3 clinical trials which we refer to as EXHANCE-3 and EXHANCE-12 or collectively, as our supportive clinical trials, to evaluate the safety of XHANCE in adults with symptoms of chronic sinusitis with or without nasal polyps over an extended period of time (3 months in the case of EXHANCE-3 and 12 months in the case of EXHANCE-12). In these trials we also assessed a variety of objective and subjective efficacy parameters, including an assessment of each patient's symptoms and functioning and the impact of XHANCE treatment on study-defined surgical eligibility criteria.
▪one Phase 1, open-label, randomized, single-dose, bioavailability study to compare the bioavailability of fluticasone propionate from XHANCE to Flonase™ and Flovent HFA™ in healthy patients and patients with mild-to-moderate asthma. We conducted this Phase 1 trial to establish a bridge between XHANCE, which 
Table of Contents

consists of our fluticasone propionate formulation combined with our EDS device, and Flonase™ and Flovent HFA™, the referenced listed drugs for our NDA. In our NDA, we relied in part on the FDA's previous findings of safety for Flonase™ and Flovent HFA™, including non-clinical toxicology findings and finding related to hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, which is a known side effect of corticosteroids. To do so, we were required to establish that the systemic exposure, or the amount of drug absorbed into the body, to fluticasone propionate following use of XHANCE did not exceed the exposure produced by Flovent HFA™. 
Clinical Trial Highlights
Our Phase 3 clinical development program for nasal polyps included a population of patients generally reflective of our intended patient population, with approximately 90% having previously tried INS therapy and almost one-third having previously undergone sinus surgery. Key results from this Phase 3 clinical trial program include:
▪In our pivotal clinical trials, XHANCE produced statistically significant benefits on both of the co-primary endpoints: a reduction of nasal congestion/obstruction symptoms at week 4 and a reduction in total polyp grade at week 16.
▪In our Phase 3 clinical trials, patients with nasal polyps generally experienced greater improvements in symptoms and reductions in polyp grade with longer duration of use.
▪In our pivotal clinical trials, approximately 16% of patients treated with XHANCE had nasal polyps eliminated (reduced to polyp grade 0) in at least one nostril after 16 weeks of treatment, and approximately 27% had nasal polyps eliminated in at least one nostril after an additional eight weeks of treatment. In our supportive trials, we observed complete response rates in at least one nostril of 48% of patients in EXHANCE-3 and 47.1% of patients in EXHANCE-12.
▪In our pivotal clinical trials, XHANCE produced improvement across all four defining symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.
▪Over 85% of patients receiving XHANCE across our pivotal clinical trials reported improvement, and approximately two-thirds reported being "much" or "very much" improved, compared to approximately one-third of patients in the placebo EDS group. In our supportive clinical trials, approximately 70% of patients with symptoms of chronic sinusitis, both with and without nasal polyps, reported that they were "much" or "very much" improved after treatment with XHANCE.
▪On a Sinonasal Outcome Test-22, the improvement with the 186- and 372- mcg doses of XHANCE was superior to the placebo EDS in both NAVIGATE I and NAVIGATE II. The magnitude of improvement associated with treatment with XHANCE was approximately 20 points. Although cross-trial comparisons have significant limitations and must be interpreted with caution, in a previous third-party study evaluating a large cohort (n=1468) of patients who were underwent sinus surgery, the degree of change on this outcome measure was approximately 18 points.
▪After 12 months of treatment with XHANCE in our supportive clinical trials, at least 50% of patients had a Sinonasal Outcome Test-22 score that was at or below 9.3, which is the average score that has been reported for healthy individuals.
▪XHANCE was well tolerated and had an adverse event profile generally similar to that observed in several comparably designed third party studies with traditional INS. The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 3%) are epistaxis, nasal septal ulceration, nasopharyngitis, nasal mucosal erythema, nasal mucosal ulcerations, nasal congestion, acute sinusitis, nasal septal erythema, headache, and pharyngitis. 
In connection with the approval of our NDA for XHANCE, the FDA required that we complete a clinical trial of XHANCE for the treatment of nasal polyps in pediatric patients by January 2022. Although this trial is ongoing, we will need to submit a request to the FDA to extend this deadline due to enrollment rates.
Chronic Sinusitis Program
In addition to XHANCE’s existing indication for the treatment of nasal polyps, in order to broaden our U.S. market opportunity, we conducted a clinical trial program in pursuit of a follow-on indication for the treatment of chronic sinusitis in the U.S. We believe XHANCE has the potential to be the first drug therapy approved by the FDA for the treatment of chronic sinusitis. We announced positive top-line results for ReOpen1 and ReOpen2 in March and 
Table of Contents

June 2022, respectively. In September 2022, we met with the FDA to discuss our planned sNDA for XHANCE as a treatment for adults with chronic sinusitis and submitted the sNDA in February 2023. 
ReOpen1
Re-Open1 was a randomized double-blinded, placebo controlled Phase 3 clinical trial examining the safety and efficacy of XHANCE versus a placebo EDS in adults with chronic sinusitis with or without nasal polyps. ReOpen1 served as one of two pivotal clinical trials we submitted to the FDA with our sNDA in February 2023 for XHANCE for the treatment of adults with chronic sinusitis. This clinical trial was conducted in the United States, Canada, Sweden, Poland, Bulgaria, The Republic of Georgia and Russia.
Top-line results from ReOpen1 are summarized below. 
Study Design
The clinical trial included a single-blind EDS-placebo lead-in and an EDS-placebo control group, a multi-center, multi-national study population to increase generalizability and an assessment of the safety and efficacy of multiple doses (186 or 372 mcg twice daily) over a 24-week period. A total of 332 adult subjects were enrolled in this study.

 | Placebo EDS(N=110) | OPN-375 186 µg(N=110) | OPN-375 372 µg(N=107)

Subjects with Nasal Polyps | 69 | 69 | 67 
Subjects without Nasal Polyps | 41 | 41 | 40 

ReOpen1 had co-primary endpoints of (i) change in a composite score of nasal congestion/obstruction symptoms, nasal discharge, and facial pain and pressure from baseline to week, and (ii) change in average percent of opacified volume of the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses from baseline to week 24. The severity of nasal symptoms was recorded by patients in an electronic diary immediately before dosing in the morning (AM) and evening (PM), and was measured using 7-day average instantaneous AM diary scores. Each symptom was scored from 0-3. The volume of the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses occupied by disease was assessed using computer-assisted assessment of CT scans to determine the percentage (0-100%) of the sinus cavity space summed across all ethmoid and maxillary sinuses that was opacified. CT scans were performed at screening and at Week 24.
This trial also evaluated several secondary endpoints, including the proportion of patients with acute disease exacerbations and their time to exacerbation and the Sinonasal Outcome Test-22 score, which considers the core defining signs and symptoms of chronic sinusitis and the impact on functioning, quality of life and sleep.
Top-Line Efficacy Results
The 186- and 372-mcg treatment groups achieved statistically significant reductions in the primary assessments of composite symptom scores at week 4 and reductions in the opacified volume of the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses on CT scans at week 24 relative to a placebo EDS. 
The following table summarizes the mean change in composite symptom scores (or CSS) from baseline to week 4 and the change in the percent of opacified volume (or APOV) of the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses from baseline to week 24.

The p-value, or probability value, is a measure of statistical significance reflecting the likelihood that an observed result occurred by chance.


In addition to the co-primary efficacy endpoints described above, we also assessed a number of secondary endpoints in the trial, including the following: 
▪Defining Symptoms (secondary endpoint). The XHANCE 186- and 372-mcg treatment groups achieved statistically significant improvement relative to the subjects receiving placebo EDS on all four of the core defining symptoms of chronic sinusitis (nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, facial pain/pressure, and sense of smell) at week 4.
▪Acute exacerbations (secondary endpoint). The XHANCE 186- and 372-mcg treatment groups had a reduced occurrence of acute exacerbations of sinusitis relative to the subjects receiving placebo EDS which reached statistical significance in the high dose group. 
▪Sinonasal Outcome Test-22 (secondary endpoint). The XHANCE 186- and 372-mcg treatment groups had statistically significant improvements in SNOT-22 scores by week 4 relative to the subjects receiving placebo EDS.
Although ReOpen1 was not designed or powered to detect statistical differences between the XHANCE treatment groups and placebo EDS in patient subgroups, we also performed the following subgroup analyses:
▪Subgroup Analysis - CSS. The subgroup of chronic sinusitis patients without nasal polyps receiving XHANCE and the subgroup of chronic sinusitis patients with concomitant nasal polyps receiving XHANCE had statistically significant reductions in CSS scores relative to the subjects receiving placebo EDS in each of these subgroups despite the lack of powering for this subgroup analysis.
▪Subgroup Analysis - APOV. The subgroup of chronic sinusitis patients with concomitant nasal polyps receiving XHANCE achieved a statistically significant reduction in APOV relative to the subjects receiving placebo EDS in this subgroup despite the lack of powering for this subgroup analysis. The subgroup of chronic sinusitis patients without nasal polyps receiving XHANCE did not achieve a statistically significant change in APOV relative to the subjects receiving placebo EDS in this subgroup. 
Top-Line Safety Results
XHANCE was well tolerated across the 186- and 372-mcg dose groups and the safety profile in this trial was generally consistent with the safety profile contained in XHANCE’s currently approved label. No serious adverse events were reported in ReOpen1. The table below summarizes adverse events that occurred at a rate of more than 3% with XHANCE and more common than the placebo EDS in this trial.

ReOpen2
ReOpen2 was a randomized double-blinded, placebo controlled Phase 3 clinical trial examining the safety and efficacy of XHANCE versus a placebo EDS in adults with chronic sinusitis without nasal polyps. ReOpen2 served as the second of two pivotal clinical trials we submitted to the FDA with our sNDA in February 2023 for XHANCE for the treatment of adults with chronic sinusitis. This clinical trial was conducted in the United States, Australia, Bulgaria, Czechia, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, Spain, The Republic of Georgia and the United Kingdom.
Top-line results from ReOpen2 are summarized below.
Study Design
The clinical trial included a single-blind EDS-placebo lead-in and an EDS-placebo control group, a multi-center, multi-national study population to increase generalizability and an assessment of the safety and efficacy of multiple doses (186 or 372 mcg twice daily) over a 24-week period. A total of 222 adult subjects were enrolled in this study.

ReOpen2 had co-primary endpoints of (i) change in a composite score of nasal congestion/obstruction symptoms, nasal discharge, and facial pain and pressure from baseline to week, and (ii) change in average percent of opacified volume of the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses from baseline to week 24. The severity of nasal symptoms was recorded by patients in an electronic diary immediately before dosing in the morning (AM) and evening (PM), and was measured using 7-day average instantaneous AM diary scores. Each symptom was scored from 0-3. The volume of the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses occupied by disease was assessed using computer-assisted assessment of CT scans to determine the percentage (0-100%) of the sinus cavity space summed across all ethmoid and maxillary sinuses that was opacified. CT scans were performed at screening and at Week 24.
This trial also evaluated several secondary endpoints, including the proportion of patients with acute disease exacerbations and their time to exacerbation and the Sinonasal Outcome Test-22 score, which considers the core defining signs and symptoms of chronic sinusitis and the impact on functioning, quality of life and sleep.
Top-Line Efficacy Results
The 186- and 372-mcg treatment groups achieved statistically significant reductions in the primary assessments of composite symptom scores at week 4 and reductions in the opacified volume of the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses on CT scans at week 24 relative to a placebo EDS. 
The following table summarizes the mean change in composite symptom scores (or CSS) from baseline to week 4 and the change in the percent of opacified volume (or APOV) of the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses from baseline to week 24.

Top-Line Safety Results
XHANCE was well tolerated across the 186- and 372-mcg dose groups and the safety profile in this trial was generally consistent with the safety profile contained in XHANCE’s currently approved label. No serious adverse events were reported in ReOpen2. The table below summarizes adverse events that occurred at a rate of more than 3% with XHANCE and more common than the placebo EDS in this trial.

Pooled Results from the ReOpen Program 
In July 2022, we announced selected pooled results from the ReOpen program. First, to inform possible differences in response of patients previously using a standard nasal steroid spray, a pre-planned analysis of pooled data assessed symptom improvement for patients entering the trials with at least moderate symptoms despite reporting use of a standard nasal steroid spray. For this subgroup, patients receiving XHANCE improved more from baseline than patients receiving placebo comparator. Second, a pooled analysis was performed to assess change in CT scans, measured by APOV at week 24, for the subgroup of patients receiving XHANCE who had chronic sinusitis without nasal polyps. Compared to patients treated with placebo comparator, XHANCE treatment produced greater reduction in sinus opacification in this subgroup. Differences between active and placebo in 186 mcg or 372 mcg XHANCE treatment groups were similar and nominally statistically significant. Finally, an analysis of pooled data found that the 372 mcg treatment group achieved a type 1 error controlled statistically significant reduction of 66% in the incidence of exacerbations compared to placebo comparator. Reductions in the number of exacerbations, ranging from 53 to 80%, were found for subgroups of chronic sinusitis patients with or without nasal polyps in the 186 mcg or 372 mcg XHANCE treatment groups in additional pre-planned exploratory analyses that were not type 1 error controlled. Exacerbations were defined as a worsening of at least one of the four cardinal symptoms of chronic sinusitis (nasal congestion/obstruction, rhinorrhea, facial pain/pressure, and loss of sense of smell) lasting at least 3 days accompanied by an escalation in medical care, such as doctor visits or antibiotic or steroid prescription. 
In addition, we completed an analysis of mean change in APOV by Patient-Reported Global Change Score (PGIC). The PGIC is a 7-point Likert scale on which the subject directly reports their perceived overall change in disease since initiating study medication. 
The following three tables summarize these results.

Intellectual Property and Barriers to Entry
XHANCE benefits from substantial intellectual property and barriers to entry, including the following:
▪Strong patent protection.  Our XHANCE U.S. patent portfolio consists of 13 issued device and method of use patents expiring on various dates from 2023 through 2036, three issued design patents expiring through 2030 and pending patent applications. We rely primarily on the protections afforded by device and method of use patents. Our issued U.S. patents and patent applications for XHANCE are based on the EDS and related technology, including the combination of this technology with fluticasone propionate. 
▪Complex drug-delivery system.  We believe the unique features of our liquid EDS device, as well as its delivery of a topical-acting corticosteroid, affords us significant protection against generic competition, as well as against a potential 505(b)(2) NDA, that seeks to reference XHANCE in order to obtain approval for a therapeutically equivalent, substitutable competitor product. XHANCE, utilizing our liquid EDS device, presents technical and human factors engineering complexities for drug-device combination products and chemistry, manufacturing and controls challenges unique to suspension and respiratory products. Any future substitutable generic entrant will need to have considerable combination product know-how to develop and validate a substitutable drug delivery device or technology to compete with XHANCE.
▪Clinical and regulatory complexity.  We conducted a clinical development program comprised of over 1,500 patients to support FDA approval of our NDA for XHANCE for the treatment of nasal polyps, including human factors studies and Phase 3 clinical trial assessments evaluating and validating the use of XHANCE. As with other drugs that primarily have local activity, we believe the regulatory pathway for products seeking approval as substitutable generic equivalents to XHANCE will be more complex and costly than the pharmacokinetic studies generally required for systemically-acting medications. We believe that any future substitutable generic competitors may be required to conduct, among other things, non-inferiority clinical trials demonstrating equivalent efficacy and safety outcomes to establish clinical bioequivalence to XHANCE. We believe these clinical trials, if required, would necessitate a significant amount of time and capital investment and present clinical development uncertainties. However, the FDA has included XHANCE on the list of upcoming product specific guidances for complex generic drug products that the FDA plans to issue, which may provide clarity for generic competitors to develop generic products that compete with XHANCE.
Intellectual Property
We strive to protect our proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our product candidates and technologies that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection, as well as know-how, trademarks, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. We internally developed our intellectual property related to XHANCE, Onzetra Xsail, the Exhalation Delivery System and related technologies. We have sought and intend to continue to seek appropriate patent protection for our product candidates, as well as other proprietary technologies and their uses by filing patent applications in the U.S. and other select countries.

Patents
As of February 1, 2023, we owned over 60 U.S. patents expiring between 2023 and 2036, and pending U.S. patent applications. In addition to our U.S. intellectual property, as of February 1, 2023, we also owned over 200 foreign issued patents expiring between 2022 and 2035, and foreign patent applications. As part of actions intended to reduce operating expenses, we intend to reduce the scope of our patent portfolio primarily in certain foreign countries where we believe commercial potential is more limited. 
Our XHANCE U.S. patent portfolio consists of 13 issued device and method of use patents expiring on various dates from 2023 through 2036, three issued design patents expiring between 2029 and 2030 and pending patent applications. The 13 device and method of use patents are published in the FDA's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated NDA (ANDA), or a 505(b)(2) NDA. If any of these potential generic competitors claim that their product will not infringe XHANCE's listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, then they must send notice to us once the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. We may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification, which would automatically prevent the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant.
The rest of our patent portfolio largely relates to patents and applications owned by us and directed to Onzetra Xsail and other product candidates, and the powder EDS, liquid EDS and related technologies.
Trade Secrets and Other Proprietary Information
We seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by requiring our employees, consultants and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment or engagement. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of the relationship with us be kept confidential and not be disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of our employees, the agreements also typically provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us, utilizing our property or relating to our business and conceived or completed during employment shall be our exclusive property to the extent permitted by law. Where appropriate, agreements we obtain with our consultants also typically contain similar assignment of invention provisions. Further, we generally require confidentiality agreements from business partners and other third parties that receive our confidential information.
Trademarks
We also rely on trademarks and trade designs to develop and maintain our competitive position. OPTINOSE®, XHANCE®, Exhalation Delivery System™ and EDS® are trademarks of ours in the U.S. 
Licensing of the Exhalation Delivery System (Outside of ENT/Allergy Indications)
Currax License Agreement
On September 25, 2019, OptiNose AS, our wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into the Currax License Agreement. Under the terms of the Currax License Agreement, we granted Currax an exclusive license to certain OptiNose patents and a non-exclusive license to certain OptiNose know-how to use, sell, offer for sale, have sold and import Onzetra® Xsail® (sumatriptan nasal powder) in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. 
Under the terms of the Currax License Agreement, we received a $3.7 million upfront payment in 2019, and an additional $0.75 million in December 2020 upon expiration of the escrow that was established for a limited period to cover potential indemnification obligations, and an additional $1.0 million milestone payment in January 2021 upon the achievement of a specified regulatory milestone. We do not expect to receive any further payments from Currax under the terms of the License Agreement other than reimbursement for certain expenses.
License Agreement with Centessa Pharmaceuticals
On January 31, 2019, OptiNose AS entered into a licensing agreement with Inexia Limited (now Orexia Therapeutics, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Centessa Pharmaceuticals (the Centessa License Agreement). Under the terms of the Centessa License Agreement, we granted Orexia an exclusive, royalty-bearing, worldwide, non-transferable, sublicensable license to the EDS and other intellectual property for the development, sale, import and manufacture of products containing orexin receptor agonist and/or orexin receptor positive modulator 
Table of Contents

molecule(s) as the sole active pharmaceutical ingredient(s) for the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of human diseases or conditions associated primarily with orexin receptor agonism and orexin receptor positive modulation. The license excludes the treatment of any disease or condition affecting the ear, nose or throat, or the treatment of any disease or condition associated primarily with another receptor, other than the Orexin 1 and Orexin 2 receptors. Orexia is solely responsible for all costs and activities related to its identification, development and commercialization of products under the Centessa License Agreement. 
Under the terms of the Centessa License Agreement, we received a $0.5 million upfront payment. For each product developed under the Centessa License Agreement, we are eligible to receive up to $8.0 million of development milestone payments and up to $37.0 million of sales milestone payments. In addition, we are eligible to receive tiered, low-to-mid single digit royalties based on net sales of any products successfully developed and commercialized under the Centessa License Agreement. We do not anticipate the receipt of any milestone or royalty payments from Orexia in the near term. 
Government Regulation
We are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal, state, and local regulatory agencies. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) and the FDA's implementing regulations set forth, among other things, requirements for the testing, development, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, approval, labeling, storage, record-keeping, reporting, distribution, import, export, sale, advertising and promotion of our products and product candidates. Although the discussion below focuses on regulation in the U.S., because that is currently our primary focus, we may seek approval for, and market, our products in other countries in the future. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the U.S., although there can be important differences.
Development and Approval
Under the FD&C Act, FDA approval of an NDA is required before any new drug can be marketed in the U.S. NDAs require extensive studies and submission of a large amount of data by the applicant.
Preclinical Testing.    Before testing any compound in human patients in the U.S., a company must generate extensive preclinical data. Preclinical testing generally includes laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as toxicological and pharmacological studies in several animal species to assess the toxicity and dosing of the product. Certain animal studies must be performed in compliance with the FDA's Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal Welfare Act.
IND Application.    Human clinical trials in the U.S. cannot commence until an investigational new drug (IND) application is submitted and becomes effective. A company must submit preclinical testing results to the FDA as part of the IND, and the FDA must evaluate whether there is an adequate basis for testing the drug in initial clinical studies in human volunteers. Unless the FDA raises concerns, the IND becomes effective 30 days following its receipt by the FDA, and the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. Once human clinical trials have commenced, the FDA may stop a clinical trial by placing it on "clinical hold" because of concerns about the safety of the product being tested, or for other reasons.
Clinical Trials.    Clinical trials involve the administration of a drug to healthy human volunteers or to patients, under the supervision of a qualified investigator. The conduct of clinical trials is subject to extensive regulation, including compliance with the FDA's bioresearch monitoring regulations and current Good Clinical Practice (cGCP) requirements, which establish standards for conducting, recording data from, and reporting the results of, clinical trials, and are intended to assure that the data and reported results are credible and accurate, and that the rights, safety, and well-being of study participants are protected. Clinical trials must be conducted under protocols that detail the study objectives, parameters for monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria, if any, to be evaluated. Each protocol is reviewed by the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by, and conducted under the auspices of, an Institutional Review Board (IRB) for each clinical site. Companies sponsoring the clinical trials, investigators, and IRBs also must comply with, as applicable, regulations and guidelines for obtaining informed consent from the study patients, following the protocol and investigational plan, adequately monitoring the clinical trial, and timely reporting of adverse events (AEs). Foreign studies conducted under an IND must meet the same requirements that apply to studies being conducted in the U.S. Data from a foreign study not conducted under an IND may be submitted in support of an NDA if the study was conducted in accordance with cGCP and the FDA is able to validate the data.
Table of Contents

A study sponsor is required to publicly post specified details about certain clinical trials and clinical trial results on government or independent websites (e.g., http://clinicaltrials.gov). Human clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, although the phases may overlap, be combined, or be subdivided in some cases:
▪Phase 1 clinical trials involve the initial administration of the investigational drug to humans, typically to a small group of healthy human subjects, but occasionally to a group of patients with the targeted disease or disorder. Phase 1 clinical trials generally are intended to evaluate the safety, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness.
▪Phase 2 clinical trials generally are controlled studies that involve a relatively small sample of the intended patient population, and are designed to develop initial data regarding the product's effectiveness, to determine dose response and the optimal dose range, and to gather additional information relating to safety and potential AEs.
▪Phase 3 clinical trials are conducted after preliminary evidence of effectiveness has been obtained, and are intended to gather the additional information about safety and effectiveness necessary to evaluate the drug's overall risk-benefit profile, and to provide a basis for physician labeling. Generally, Phase 3 clinical development programs consist of expanded,multi-site, large-scale studies of patients with the target disease or disorder to obtain statistical evidence of the efficacy and safety of the drug at the proposed dosing regimen.Phase 3 data often form the core basis on which the FDA evaluates a drug’s safety and effectiveness when considering the product application.
The sponsoring company, the FDA, or the IRB may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Further, success in early-stage clinical trials does not assure success in later-stage clinical trials. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be subject to alternative interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval.
NDA Submission and Review.    The FD&C Act provides two pathways for the approval of new drugs through an NDA. An NDA under Section 505(b)(1) of the FD&C Act is a comprehensive application to support approval of a product candidate that includes, among other things, data and information to demonstrate that the proposed drug is safe and effective for its proposed uses, that production methods are adequate to ensure its identity, strength, quality, and purity of the drug, and that proposed labeling is appropriate and contains all necessary information. A 505(b)(1) NDA contains results of the full set of preclinical studies and clinical trials conducted by or on behalf of the applicant to characterize and evaluate the product candidate.
Section 505(b)(2) of the FD&C Act provides an alternate regulatory pathway to obtain FDA approval that permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely to some extent upon the FDA's findings of safety and effectiveness for an approved product that acts as the reference drug and submit its own product-specific data — which may include data from preclinical studies or clinical trials conducted by or on behalf of the applicant — to address differences between the product candidate and the reference drug. We obtained FDA approval of XHANCE through the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway, with Flonase™ and Flovent HFA™ as the reference drugs. Flonase™ and Flovent HFA™ contain fluticasone propionate, which is also the active ingredient in XHANCE.
The submission of an NDA under either Section 505(b)(1) or Section 505(b)(2) generally requires payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA. The FDA reviews applications to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the manufacturing controls are adequate to assure and preserve the product's identity, strength, quality, and purity. For some NDAs, the FDA may convene an advisory committee to seek insights and recommendations on issues relevant to approval of the application. Although the FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, the agency considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Our product and product candidates include products that combine drug and device components in a manner that the FDA considers to meet the definition of a "combination product" under FDA regulations. The FDA exercises significant discretion over the regulation of combination products, including the discretion to require separate marketing applications for the drug and device components in a combination product. For XHANCE, FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) had primary jurisdiction for review of the NDA, and both the drug and 
Table of Contents

device were reviewed under one marketing application. However, for a drug-device combination product CDER typically consults with the Center for Devices and Radiological Health in the NDA review process.
The FDA may determine that a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) is necessary to ensure that the benefits of a new product outweigh its risks, and the product can therefore be approved. A REMS may include various elements, ranging from a medication guide or patient package insert to limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, depending on what the FDA considers necessary for the safe use of the drug. Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, certain applications for approval must also include an assessment, generally based on clinical study data, of the safety and effectiveness of the subject drug in relevant pediatric populations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications.
Once the FDA accepts an NDA submission — which occurs, if at all, within 60 days after submission of the NDA — the FDA's goal for a non-priority review of an NDA is ten months. The review process can be and often is significantly extended, however, by FDA requests for additional information, studies, or clarification. After review of an NDA and the facilities where the product is manufactured, the FDA either issues an approval letter or a complete response letter (CRL) outlining the deficiencies in the submission. The CRL may require additional testing or information, including additional preclinical or clinical data. Even if such additional information and data are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA still does not meet the standards for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than the sponsor.
Obtaining regulatory approval often takes a number of years, involves the expenditure of substantial resources, and depends on a number of factors, including the severity of the disease in question, the availability of alternative treatments, and the risks and benefits demonstrated in clinical trials. Additionally, as a condition of approval, the FDA may impose restrictions that could affect the commercial success of a drug or require post-approval commitments, including the completion within a specified time period of additional clinical studies, which often are referred to as "Phase 4" or "post-marketing" studies. 
Post-approval modifications to the drug, such as changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, may require a sponsor to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials, to be submitted in a new or supplemental NDA, which would require FDA approval. 
Post-Approval Regulation
Once approved, drug products are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA. If ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety or manufacturing problems occur after the product reaches the market, the FDA may at any time withdraw product approval or take actions that would limit or suspend marketing. Additionally, the FDA may require post-marketing studies or clinical trials, changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, or the implementation of other risk management measures, including distribution-related restrictions, if there are new safety information developments.
Good Manufacturing Practices.    Companies engaged in manufacturing drug products or their components must comply with applicable cGMP requirements and product-specific regulations enforced by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. Compliance with cGMP includes adhering to requirements relating to organization and training of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, quality control and quality assurance, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, and records and reports. The FDA regulates and inspects equipment, facilities, and processes used in manufacturing pharmaceutical products prior to approval. If, after receiving approval, a company makes a material change in manufacturing equipment, location, or process (all of which are, to some degree, incorporated in the NDA), additional regulatory review and approval may be required. The FDA also conducts regular, periodic visits to re-inspect equipment, facilities, and processes following the initial approval of a product. Failure to comply with applicable cGMP requirements and conditions of product approval may lead the FDA to take enforcement action or seek sanctions, including fines, issuance of warning letters, civil penalties, injunctions, suspension of manufacturing operations, operating restrictions, withdrawal of FDA approval, seizure or recall of products, and criminal prosecution. Although we periodically monitor the FDA compliance of our third-party manufacturers, we cannot be certain that our present or future third-party manufacturers will consistently comply with cGMP and other applicable FDA regulatory requirements.

We also need to comply with some of the FDA's manufacturing and safety regulations for devices. In addition to cGMP, the FDA requires that our drug-device combination product comply with the Quality System Regulation (QSR), which sets forth the FDA's manufacturing quality standards for medical devices. The FDA also requires that we comply with some device safety reporting requirements for our drug-device combination product. 
Advertising and Promotion.    The FDA and other federal regulatory agencies closely regulate the marketing and promotion of drugs through, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, advertising and promotion to healthcare professionals, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet. A product cannot be commercially promoted before it is approved. After approval, product promotion can include only those claims relating to safety and effectiveness that are consistent with the labeling approved by the FDA. Healthcare providers are permitted to prescribe drugs for "off-label" uses — that is, uses not approved by the FDA and not described in the product's labeling — because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA regulations impose restrictions on manufacturers' communications regarding off-label uses. Broadly speaking, a manufacturer may not promote a drug for off-label use, but under certain conditions may engage in non-promotional, balanced, scientific communication regarding off-label use. In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, state and federal fraud and abuse laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements and restrictions in this area may subject a company to adverse publicity and enforcement action by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes a drug.
Other Requirements.    NDA holders must comply with other regulatory requirements, including submitting annual reports, reporting information about adverse drug experiences, and maintaining certain records.
Hatch-Waxman Act
The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the Hatch-Waxman Act) establishes two abbreviated approval pathways for pharmaceutical products that are in some way follow-on versions of already approved products.
Generic Drugs.    A generic version of an approved drug is approved by means of an ANDA, by which the sponsor demonstrates that the proposed product is the same as the approved, brand-name drug, which is referred to as the reference listed drug (RLD). Generally, an ANDA must contain data and information showing that the proposed generic product and RLD (i) have the same active ingredient, in the same strength and dosage form, to be delivered via the same route of administration, (ii) are intended for the same uses, and (iii) are bioequivalent. This is instead of independently demonstrating the proposed product's safety and effectiveness, which are inferred from the fact that the product is the same as the RLD, which the FDA previously found to be safe and effective.
505(b)(2) NDAs.    As discussed above, if a product is similar, but not identical, to an already approved product, it may be submitted for approval via an NDA under section 505(b)(2) of the FD&C Act. Unlike an ANDA, this does not excuse the sponsor from demonstrating the proposed product's safety and effectiveness. Rather, the sponsor is permitted to rely to some degree on information from investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference, and must submit its own product-specific data of safety and effectiveness to an extent necessary because of the differences between the products. An NDA approved under 505(b)(2) may in turn serve as an RLD for subsequent applications from other sponsors.
RLD Patents.    In an NDA, a sponsor must identify patents that claim the drug substance or drug product or a method of using the drug. When the drug is approved, those patents are among the information about the product that is listed in the FDA publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, which is referred to as the Orange Book. The sponsor of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application seeking to rely on an approved product as the RLD must make one of several certifications regarding each listed patent. A “Paragraph I” certification is the sponsor’s statement that patent information has not been filed for the RLD. A “Paragraph II” certification is the sponsor’s statement that the RLD’s patents have expired. A "Paragraph III" certification is the sponsor's statement that it will wait for the patent to expire before obtaining approval for its product. A "Paragraph IV" certification is an assertion that the patent does not block approval of the later product, either because the patent is invalid or unenforceable or because the patent, even if valid, is not infringed by the new product. 
Table of Contents

Regulatory Exclusivities.    The Hatch-Waxman Act provides periods of regulatory exclusivity for products that would serve as RLDs for an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application. If a product is a "new chemical entity," or NCE — generally meaning that the active moiety has never before been approved in any drug — there is a period of five years from the product's approval during which the FDA may not accept for filing any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for a drug with the same active moiety. An ANDA or 505(b)(2) application may be submitted after four years, however, if the sponsor of the application makes a Paragraph IV certification.
A product that is not an NCE may qualify for a three-year period of exclusivity if the NDA contains new clinical data, (other than bioavailability studies) derived from studies conducted by or for the sponsor, that were necessary for approval. In that instance, the exclusivity period does not preclude filing or review of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application; rather, the FDA is precluded from granting final approval to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until three years after approval of the RLD. Additionally, the exclusivity applies only to the conditions of approval that required submission of the clinical data.
Once the FDA accepts for filing an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application containing a Paragraph IV certification, the applicant must within 20 days provide notice to the RLD or listed drug NDA holder and patent owner that the application has been submitted, and provide the factual and legal basis for the applicant's assertion that the patent is invalid or not infringed. If the NDA holder or patent owner files suit against the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant for patent infringement within 45 days of receiving the Paragraph IV notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for a period of 30 months or the resolution of the underlying suit, whichever is earlier. If the RLD has NCE exclusivity and the notice is given and suit filed during the fifth year of exclusivity, the regulatory stay extends until 7.5 years after the RLD approval. The FDA may approve the proposed product before the expiration of the regulatory stay if a court finds the patent invalid or not infringed or if the court shortens the period because the parties have failed to cooperate in expediting the litigation. In connection with the submission of our sNDA for XHANCE in February 2023, we provided Paragraph IV certification notices to the NDA holder and patent owner of the two unexpired Orange Book-listed patents covering Flovent HFA. As noted above, these parties have 45 days from receiving the Paragraph IV certification notices to file a patent infringement suit which would prohibit the FDA from approving our sNDA for up to 30-months. 
If the RLD has NCE exclusivity and the notice is given and suit filed during the fifth year of exclusivity, the regulatory stay extends until 7.5 years after the RLD approval. The FDA may approve the proposed product before the expiration of the regulatory stay if a court finds the patent invalid or not infringed or if the court shortens the period because the parties have failed to cooperate in expediting the litigation.
Patent Term Restoration.    A portion of the patent term lost during product development and FDA review of an NDA is restored if approval of the application is the first permitted commercial marketing of a drug containing the active ingredient. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of the IND or the date of patent grant (whichever is later) and the date of submission of the NDA, plus the time between the date of submission of the NDA and the date of FDA approval of the product. The maximum period of restoration is five years, and the patent cannot be extended to more than 14 years from the date of FDA approval of the product. Only one patent claiming each approved product is eligible for restoration and the patent holder must apply for restoration within 60 days of approval. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for patent term restoration. 
Other Exclusivities
Pediatric Exclusivity.    Section 505A of the FD&C Act provides for six months of additional exclusivity or patent protection if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data does not need to show that the product is effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA's request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or Orange Book listed patent protection that cover the drug are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application owing to regulatory exclusivity or listed patents. When any product is approved, we will evaluate seeking pediatric exclusivity as appropriate.
Orphan Drug Exclusivity.    The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for the development of drugs intended to treat rare diseases or conditions, which generally are diseases or conditions affecting less than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. If a sponsor demonstrates that a drug product qualifies for orphan drug designation, the FDA grants orphan drug designation to the product for that use. The benefits of orphan drug designation include research and development tax credits and exemption from user fees. A drug that is approved for the orphan drug designated 
Table of Contents

indication generally is granted seven years of orphan drug exclusivity. During that period, the FDA generally may not approve any other application for the same product for the same indication, although there are exceptions, most notably when the later product is shown to be clinically superior to the product with exclusivity. The FDA can revoke a product’s orphan drug exclusivity under certain circumstances, including when the product sponsor is unable to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the product to meet patient needs. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition.
U.S. Healthcare Reform 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended (the "Affordable Care Act"), is a sweeping measure intended to expand healthcare coverage within the U.S., primarily through the imposition of health insurance mandates on employers and individuals and expansion of the Medicaid program. This law substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. Changes that may affect our business include those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes, benefits for patients within a coverage gap in the Medicare Part D prescription drug program (commonly known as the "donut hole"), rules regarding prescription drug benefits under the health insurance exchanges, changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, expansion of the Public Health Service Act's 340B drug pricing program (340B Program), fraud and abuse, and enforcement. These changes impact existing government healthcare programs and have resulted in the development of new programs, including Medicare payment for performance initiatives. Details of the changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program and the 340B Program are discussed under the risk factor "If we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid drug rebate program, or other governmental pricing programs, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects" in the "Risk Factors" section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Some states have elected not to expand their Medicaid programs to individuals with an income of up to 133% of the federal poverty level, as is permitted under the Affordable Care Act. For each state that does not choose to expand its Medicaid program, there may be fewer insured patients overall, which could impact our sales of products and product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval, and our business and financial condition. Where new patients receive insurance coverage under any of the new Medicaid options made available through the Affordable Care Act, the possibility exists that manufacturers may be required to pay Medicaid rebates on drugs used under these circumstances, a decision that could impact manufacturer revenues. 
Certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act have been subject to judicial challenges, as well as efforts to modify them or to alter their interpretation and implementation. For example, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. government signed into law comprehensive tax legislation, referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act), which includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amended the Medicare statute to reduce the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly known as the “donut hole,” by raising the required manufacturer point-of-sale discount for pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D from 50% to 70% off the negotiated price effective as of January 1, 2019. The IRA (defined below) replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new Part D manufacturer discount program beginning in 2025.
It is unclear how efforts to modify or invalidate the Affordable Care Act or its implementing regulations, or portions thereof, will affect the Affordable Care Act or our business. Additional legislative changes, regulatory changes, and further judicial challenges related to the Affordable Care Act remain possible. Any such changes could decrease the number of individuals with health coverage. It is possible that the Affordable Care Act, as currently enacted or as it or its implementation may be modified in the future, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to maintain or increase sales of our products or product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval or to successfully commercialize our products and product candidates.
Additionally, on December 20, 2019, then-President Trump signed the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2020 into law (P.L. 116-94) that includes a piece of bipartisan legislation called the Creating and Restoring Equal Access to Equivalent Samples Act of 2019 or “the CREATES Act.” The CREATES Act aims to address the concern articulated by both the FDA and others in the industry that some brand manufacturers have improperly restricted the distribution of their products, including by invoking the existence of a REMS for certain products, to deny generic 
Table of Contents

product developers access to samples of brand products. Because generic product developers need samples to conduct certain comparative testing required by the FDA, some have attributed the inability to timely obtain samples as a cause of delay in the entry of generic products. To remedy this concern, the CREATES Act establishes a private cause of action that permits a generic product developer to sue the brand manufacturer to compel it to furnish the necessary samples on “commercially reasonable, market-based terms.” In 2021 and 2022 we provided units of XHANCE to a generic manufacturer in compliance with the CREATES Act.
Coverage and Reimbursement 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of our products and any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval. Sales of any of our products and product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third-party payors, including government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and private payors, such as commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. Third-party payors determine which drugs they will cover and the amount of reimbursement they will provide for a covered drug. In the U.S., there is no uniform system among payors for making coverage and reimbursement decisions. In addition, the process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication.
In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for our products we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costly studies required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Even if we conduct pharmacoeconomic studies, our products and product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective by payors. Further, a payor's decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved.
In the past, payors have implemented reimbursement metrics and periodically revised those metrics as well as the methodologies used as the basis for reimbursement rates or rebates, such as average sales price (ASP), average manufacturer price (AMP), and actual acquisition cost. The existing data for reimbursement based on these metrics is relatively limited, although certain states have begun to survey acquisition cost data for the purpose of setting Medicaid reimbursement rates. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) surveys and publishes retail pharmacy acquisition cost information in the form of National Average Drug Acquisition Cost files to provide state Medicaid agencies with a basis of comparison for their own reimbursement and pricing methodologies and rates.
Participation in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires us to pay a rebate for each unit of drug reimbursed by Medicaid. The amount of the "basic" portion of the rebate for each product is set by law as the larger of: (i) 23.1% of quarterly AMP, or (ii) the difference between quarterly AMP and the quarterly best price (Best Price), which, in general, represents the lowest price available from the manufacturer to any entity in the U.S. in any pricing structure, calculated to include all applicable sales and associated rebates, discounts and other price concessions. AMP must be reported on a monthly and quarterly basis, and Best Price is reported on a quarterly basis, to CMS, the federal agency that administers the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. In addition, the rebate also includes the "additional" portion, which adjusts the overall rebate amount upward as an "inflation penalty" when the drug's latest quarter's AMP exceeds the drug's AMP from the first full quarter of sales after launch, adjusted for increases in the Consumer Price Index-Urban. The upward adjustment in the rebate amount per unit is equal to the excess amount of the current AMP over the inflation-adjusted AMP from the first full quarter of sales. The rebate amount is recomputed each quarter based on our report to CMS of current quarterly AMP and Best Price for the relevant drug. On March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of AMP, for single-source and innovator multiple-source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024.
The terms of our participation in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program require us to report revisions to AMP or Best Price within a period not to exceed 12 quarters from the quarter in which the data was originally due, and CMS may request or require restatements for earlier periods as well. Any such revisions could have the impact of increasing or decreasing our rebate liability for prior quarters, depending on the direction of the revision. The Affordable Care Act made significant changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, and CMS issued a final regulation, which became effective on April 1, 2016, to implement the changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program under the Affordable Care Act. On December 21, 2020, CMS issued a final regulation that (i) modified existing Medicaid Drug Rebate Program regulations to permit reporting multiple Best Price figures with regard to value‑based purchasing 
Table of Contents

arrangements; and (ii) provided definitions for “line extension,” “new formulation,” and related terms with the practical effect of expanding the scope of drugs considered to be line extensions, with such changes taking effect in 2022. Our failure to comply with the aforementioned price reporting and rebate obligations, as well as pharmacy benefit manager “accumulator” programs, could negatively impact our financial results. In addition, statutory and regulatory changes or other agency action regarding the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program could negatively affect our financial results or expand our rebate liability.
Manufacturers have obligations to report the ASP to the Medicare Program as a part of the agreement to participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. For calendar quarters beginning January 1, 2022, manufacturers will need to report the ASP for certain drugs under the Medicare program regardless of whether they participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Statutory or regulatory changes or CMS guidance could affect the ASP for products and the resulting Medicare payment rate, and could negatively affect results of operations.
Federal law requires that any manufacturer that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program also participate in the 340B Program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer's drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B Program, which is administered by the Health Resource and Services Administration (HRSA) requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B "ceiling price" for the manufacturer's covered outpatient drugs. These 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula, which is based on the AMP and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Any changes to the definition of AMP and the Medicaid rebate amount under federal legislation could affect our 340B ceiling price calculations and negatively impact our results of operations. HRSA issued a final regulation regarding the calculation of the 340B ceiling price and the imposition of civil monetary penalties on manufacturers that knowingly and intentionally overcharge covered entities, which became effective on January 1, 2019. It is currently unclear how HRSA will apply its enforcement authority under the regulation. HRSA also has implemented a ceiling price reporting requirement related to the 340B Program under which we are required to report 340B ceiling prices to HRSA on a quarterly basis, and HRSA then publishes that information to covered entities. Moreover, under a final regulation effective January 13, 2021, HRSA newly established an administrative dispute resolution, or ADR, process for claims by covered entities that a manufacturer has engaged in overcharging, and by manufacturers that a covered entity violated the prohibitions against diversion or duplicate discounts. Such claims are to be resolved through an ADR panel of government officials rendering a decision that could be appealed only in federal court. An ADR proceeding could subject us to onerous procedural requirements and could result in additional liability. In addition, legislation may be introduced that, if passed, would further expand the 340B Program to additional covered entities or would require participating manufacturers to agree to provide 340B discounted pricing on drugs used in an inpatient setting.
In the U.S. Medicare program, outpatient prescription drugs may be covered under Medicare Part D. Medicare Part D is a voluntary prescription drug benefit, through which Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities for coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans provided for under Medicare Part C.
Coverage and reimbursement for covered outpatient drugs under Part D are not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Although Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, they have some flexibility to establish those categories and classes and are not required to cover all of the drugs in each category or class. Medicare Part D prescription drug plans may use formularies to limit the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class and/or impose differential cost sharing or other utilization management techniques.
The availability of coverage under Medicare Part D may increase demand for our products and any product candidates for which we receive marketing approval. However, in order for the products that we market to be included on the formularies of Part D prescription drug plans, we likely will have to offer pricing that is lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Changes to Medicare Part D that give plans more freedom to limit coverage or manage utilization, and other cost reduction initiatives in the program could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for any approved products and could harm our business.
Table of Contents

In addition, manufacturers are required to provide to CMS a 70% discount on brand name prescription drugs utilized by Medicare Part D beneficiaries when those beneficiaries are in the coverage gap phase of the Part D benefit design. Civil monetary penalties can be applied if a manufacturer fails to provide discounts in the amount of 125% of the discount that was due. Congress could enact legislation that sunsets this discount program and replaces it with a new manufacturer discount program.
In order to be eligible to have our products or any future products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs, as applicable, and purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, we also participate in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) pricing program. Under this program, we are obligated to make our "innovator" drugs available for procurement on an FSS contract and charge a price to four federal agencies — the VA, U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Public Health Service and U.S. Coast Guard — that is no higher than the statutory Federal Ceiling Price (FCP). The FCP is based on the non-federal average manufacturer price (Non-FAMP), which we calculate and report to the VA on a quarterly and annual basis. We also participate in the Tricare Retail Pharmacy program, under which we pay quarterly rebates on utilization of innovator products that are dispensed through the Tricare Retail Pharmacy network to Tricare beneficiaries. The rebates are calculated as the difference between the annual Non-FAMP and FCP.
Pricing and rebate calculations vary across products and programs, are complex, and are often subject to interpretation by us, governmental or regulatory agencies, and the courts. Significant civil monetary penalties can be applied if we are found to have knowingly submitted any false AMP, best price, or Non-FAMP information to the government or fail to submit the required price data on a timely basis. Such conduct also could be grounds for CMS to terminate the Medicaid drug rebate agreement, in which case federal payments may not be available under Medicaid or Medicare Part B for our covered outpatient drugs. Civil monetary penalties could also be applied if we are found to have charged 340B covered entities more than the statutorily mandated ceiling price. In addition, claims submitted to federally-funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, for drugs priced based on incorrect pricing data provided by a manufacturer can implicate the False Claims Act.
The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, Congress could enact a drug price negotiation program under which the prices for certain high Medicare spend single source drugs would be capped by reference to the non-federal AMP. This or any other legislative change could impact the market conditions for our products. We expect continued scrutiny on government price reporting and pricing more generally from Congress, agencies, and other bodies and are seeing an increase in state interest in price reporting, transparency, and other policies to address drug pricing concerns.
Beginning April 1, 2013, Medicare payments for all items and services, including drugs, were reduced by, on average, 2% per fiscal year under the sequestration (i.e., automatic spending reductions) required by the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. Sequestration is currently set at 2% and will increase to 2.25% for the first half of fiscal year 2030, to 3% for the second half of fiscal year 2030, and to 4% for the remainder of the sequestration period that last through the first six months of fiscal year 2031. As long as these cuts remain in effect, they could adversely impact payment for any of our products that are reimbursed under Medicare. Other legislative or regulatory cost containment legislation could have a similar effect.
Further, the Affordable Care Act may reduce the profitability of drug products. It expanded manufacturers' rebate liability under the Medicaid program from fee-for-service Medicaid utilization to include the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations as well, and increased the minimum Medicaid rebate due for most innovator drugs. The Affordable Care Act and subsequent legislation also changed the definition of AMP. On February 1, 2016, CMS issued final regulations to implement the changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program under the Affordable Care Act. These regulations became effective on April 1, 2016.
On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or the IRA, which, among other things, establishes a Medicare Part B inflation rebate scheme, under which, generally speaking, manufacturers will owe rebates if the average sales price of a Part B drug increases faster than the pace of inflation. Failure to timely pay a Part B inflation rebate is subject to a civil monetary penalty. The IRA also establishes a Medicare Part D inflation rebate scheme, under which, generally speaking, manufacturers will owe rebates if the AMP of a Part D drug increases faster than the pace of inflation. The IRA also creates a drug price negotiation program under which the prices for Medicare units of certain high Medicare spend drugs and biologics without generic or biosimilar competition will be capped by reference to, among other things, a specified non-federal AMP, 
Table of Contents

starting in 2026. Failure to comply with requirements under the drug price negotiation program is subject to an excise tax and/or a civil monetary penalty. The IRA further makes changes to the Medicare Part D benefit, including a limit on annual out-of-pocket costs, and a change in manufacturer liability under the program that could negatively affect the profitability of our products. Failure to pay a discount under this new program will be subject to a civil monetary penalty. Congress continues to examine various policy proposals that may result in pressure on the prices of prescription drugs in the government health benefit programs. The IRA or other legislative change could impact the market conditions for our products. Payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives as well. For example, CMS may develop new payment and delivery models, such as bundled payment models.
The Affordable Care Act requires pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded prescription drugs to pay a branded prescription drug fee to the federal government. Each such manufacturer pays a prorated share of the branded prescription drug fee of $2.8 billion in fee year 2020 and subsequent fee years, based on the dollar value of its branded prescription drug sales to certain federal programs identified in the law. The Affordable Care Act also expanded the Public Health Service's 340B Program to include additional types of covered entities. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may affect our business practices with healthcare practitioners. It appears likely that the Affordable Care Act will continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.
Additional legislative changes, regulatory changes and judicial challenges related to the Affordable Care Act remain possible, as discussed above under the heading "U.S. Healthcare Reform." In addition, there likely will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators, and third-party payors to contain healthcare costs. Thus, even if we obtain favorable coverage and reimbursement status for our products and any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Additional information regarding these programs is discussed under the risk factor "If we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid drug rebate program, or other governmental pricing programs, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects" in the "Risk Factors" section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, our business is subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. These laws include, but are not limited to, the following:
•The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. A violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute may be established without proving actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, damages, civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing, or recommending pharmaceuticals, including certain discounts, or engaging such individuals as consultants, speakers or advisors, may be subject to scrutiny if they do not fit squarely within the exception or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability. Moreover, there are no safe harbors for many common practices, such as educational and research grants, charitable donations, product support and patient assistance programs. Arrangements that implicate the Anti-Kickback Statute and do not fit within an exception or safe harbor are reviewed on a case-by-case basis to determine whether, based on the facts and circumstances, they violate the statute.

•The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits any person from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by private individuals known as qui tam relators in the name of the government, and who may share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have faced enforcement actions under the False Claims Act for, among other things, providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product, and other interactions with prescribers and other customers including interactions that may have affected customers' billing or coding practices on claims submitted to the federal government. Other companies have faced enforcement actions for causing false claims to be submitted because of the company's marketing the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. Federal enforcement agencies also have shown increased interest in pharmaceutical companies' product and patient assistance programs, including reimbursement and co-pay support services, and a number of investigations into these programs have resulted in significant civil and criminal settlements.
•The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations (collectively, HIPAA), prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors. HIPAA also prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. HIPAA also imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HIPAA imposes privacy and security obligations on covered entity health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses, as well as their "business associates" – certain persons or entities that create, receive, maintain, or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a specified service or performing a function on behalf of a covered entity. HIPAA has four tiers of civil monetary penalties and grants state attorneys enforcement authority. The Department of Justice also may impose criminal penalties. Additionally, certain states have adopted comparable privacy and security laws and regulations, some of which may be more stringent than HIPAA, and numerous federal and state laws, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws, including, for example, Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), govern the collection, use, and disclosure and protection of certain health-related and other personal information.
•Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA, other than potentially with respect to providing certain employee benefits, we may obtain health information from third parties that are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA, and other privacy and data security and consumer protection laws, and we could potentially be subject to criminal penalties if we, our affiliates, or our agents knowingly receive individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA, and could also potentially be subject to other civil and/or criminal penalties if we obtain, use or disclose information in a manner not permitted by other privacy and data security and consumer protection laws.
•The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Several states now require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products in those states and to report gifts and payments to individual health care providers in those states. Some of these states also prohibit certain marketing-related activities including the provision of gifts, meals, or other items to certain health care providers. Other states have laws requiring pharmaceutical sales representatives to be registered or licensed, and still others impose limits on co-pay assistance that pharmaceutical companies can offer to patients. In addition, several states require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes.
•The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, implemented as the Open Payments program, and its implementing regulations, requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to

report annually to CMS information related to direct or indirect payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held in the company by physicians and their immediate family members. 
Compliance with such laws and regulations requires substantial resources. Because of the breadth of these various fraud and abuse laws, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Such a challenge could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In the event governmental authorities conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations, they may impose sanctions under these laws, which are potentially significant and may include civil monetary penalties, damages, exclusion of an entity or individual from participation in government health care programs, criminal fines and imprisonment, additional reporting requirements if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other settlement to resolve allegations of violations of these laws, as well as the potential curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity.
Healthcare Privacy Laws
We may be subject to laws and regulations covering data privacy and the protection of health-related and other personal information. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues which may affect our business. Numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of personal information. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions and create liability for us (including the imposition of significant penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity that could negatively affect our business. In addition, healthcare providers who prescribe our products and research institutions we collaborate with are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1997 prohibits corporations and their intermediaries from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any official of another country, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in that capacity.
Human Capital
Culture is a critical element in the management of our organization. Our colleagues are focused on driving our business with the Optinose values as the foundation for all our efforts. Our goal is that each colleague feels a deep connection to what they do, loves coming to work and is aligned to our One Mission – to improve lives. Our values of Authenticity, Fearless Conversations, Friendship, Openness, Perseverance and Possibility Thinking guide our actions and decisions.
As of February 20, 2023, we had a total of 141 full-time employees all of whom are in the United States, and no part-time employees. 70% of our employees are in customer-facing roles. Most of our employees have significant prior experience within the pharmaceutical, biotech or device industries.
We continue to focus on building a high performing organization through our emphasis on accountability for results as measured by our performance development process. To help ensure that employees fully understand the Company’s long-term strategy, and how their work contributes to the Company’s success, we utilize a variety of channels to facilitate open and direct communication, including: regular calls with all colleagues, ongoing update communications as needed, regular executive field visits and annual colleague engagement surveys. 
We provide our colleagues with competitive salaries and bonuses, opportunities for equity ownership, opportunities for professional development and a robust benefits package. Our compensation programs, including short- and long-term incentives, are designed to enable us to attract and retain individuals whose skills are critical to our current and long-term success. Our compensation philosophy is to ensure that our colleague salaries fall within an

appropriate range around the median of the marketplace for like positions, with differentiation based on performance and contribution, time in position, and criticality of skill set. Within our compensation programs, we also aim to align the interests of our colleagues with those of our shareholders.
We value diversity and are focused on maintaining an inclusive work environment that supports our culture and the needs of the communities we serve and in which we work. Currently, women represent 57% of our colleagues. None of our colleagues are represented by any collective bargaining unit. We believe that we maintain good relations with our colleagues.
As a result of the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ways in which work has changed, we offer a hybrid work environment in our Yardley headquarters in which colleagues work in the office three days and may work remotely the other two days, if desired. This enables us to provide colleagues with flexibility as well as provide an environment in which creativity and innovation are fostered. 
Properties
Our principal office is located in Yardley, Pennsylvania, where we lease approximately 30,000 square feet of office space pursuant to a lease that expires in May 2024. We also lease a facility in Ewing, New Jersey. We believe our facilities are adequate to meet our current needs, although we may seek to negotiate new leases or to re-evaluate the location and amount of space needed for our operations. We believe appropriate alternative space will be readily available on commercially reasonable terms.
