ITEM 1.     BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are a commercial-stage medical device company that designs, manufactures and sells image-guided, catheter-based systems that are used by physicians to treat patients with peripheral artery disease, or PAD. Patients with PAD have a build-up of plaque in the arteries that supply blood to areas away from the heart, particularly the pelvis and legs. Our mission is to significantly improve the treatment of vascular disease through the introduction of products based on our Lumivascular platform, the only intravascular image-guided system available in this market. We manufacture and sell a suite of products in the United States and select international markets. Our current products include our Lightbox imaging console, the Ocelot family of catheters, which are designed to allow physicians to penetrate a total blockage in an artery, known as a chronic total occlusion, or CTO, and Pantheris, our image-guided atherectomy device which is designed to allow physicians to precisely remove arterial plaque in PAD patients. In October 2015 we received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for commercialization of Pantheris, and we received additional 510(k) clearances for enhanced versions of Pantheris in March 2016 and May 2018 and commenced sales of Pantheris in the United States and select European countries promptly thereafter. We also offer the Wildcat and Kittycat catheters, which are used for crossing CTOs but do not contain on-board imaging technology.
 
Current treatments for PAD, including bypass surgery, can be costly and may result in complications, high levels of post-surgery pain, and lengthy hospital stays and recovery times. Minimally invasive, or endovascular, treatments for PAD include stenting, angioplasty, and atherectomy, which is the use of a catheter-based device for the removal of plaque. These treatments all have limitations in their safety or efficacy profiles and frequently result in recurrence of the disease, also known as restenosis. We believe one of the main contributing factors to high restenosis rates for PAD patients treated with endovascular technologies is the amount of vascular injury that occurs during an intervention. Specifically, these treatments often disrupt the membrane between the outermost layers of the artery, which is referred to as the external elastic lamina, or EEL.
 
Our Lumivascular platform is the only technology that offers real-time visualization of the inside of the artery during PAD treatment through the use of optical coherence tomography, or OCT, a high resolution, light-based, radiation-free imaging technology. Our Lumivascular platform provides physicians with real-time OCT images from the inside of an artery, and we believe Ocelot and Pantheris are the first products to offer intravascular visualization during CTO crossing and atherectomy, respectively. We believe this approach will significantly improve patient outcomes by providing physicians with a clearer picture of the artery using radiation-free image guidance during treatment, enabling them to better differentiate between plaque and healthy arterial structures. Our Lumivascular platform is designed to improve patient safety by enabling physicians to direct treatment towards the plaque, while avoiding damage to healthy portions of the artery.
 
During the first quarter of 2015, we completed enrollment of patients in VISION, a clinical trial designed to support our August 2015 510(k) filing with the FDA for our Pantheris atherectomy device. VISION was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Pantheris to perform atherectomy using intravascular imaging and successfully achieved all primary and secondary safety and efficacy endpoints. We believe the data from VISION allows us to demonstrate that avoiding damage to healthy arterial structures, and in particular disruption of the external elastic lamina, which is the membrane between the outermost layers of the artery, reduces the likelihood of restenosis, or re-narrowing, of the diseased artery. Although the original VISION study protocol was not designed to follow patients beyond six months, we have worked with 18 of the 20 VISION sites to re-solicit consent from previous clinical trial patients in order to evaluate patient outcomes through 12 and 24 months following initial treatment. Data collection for the patients from participating sites was completed in May 2017, and we released the final 12 and 24-month results for a total of 89 patients in July 2017.
 
We commenced commercialization of Pantheris as part of our Lumivascular platform in the United States and in select international markets in March 2016, after obtaining the required marketing authorizations. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we began enrolling patients in INSIGHT, a clinical trial designed to support a filing with the FDA to expand the indication for our Pantheris atherectomy device to specifically include in-stent restenosis. We received CE Marking in December 2017 and 510(k) clearance in May 2018 for a next-generation version of our Pantheris atherectomy device, which we believe represents a significant improvement over our prior product. This next-generation version of Pantheris includes new features and design improvements to the handle, shaft, balloon and nose cone that we believe improve usability and reliability of the device. The next-generation Pantheris atherectomy device is available for commercial sale in the United States and select international markets. On December 13, 2018 we announced the 500th patient treated with the next-generation Pantheris. All previous versions of Pantheris have been discontinued.

We are developing a line extension of our Pantheris image-guided atherectomy platform, Pantheris SV (Small Vessel), a lower profile version of Pantheris. The lower profile Pantheris has a smaller diameter and longer length that we believe will optimize it for use in smaller vessels. We submitted a 510(k) application for Pantheris SV in August 2018 and received CE Marking approval in October 2018. On November 15, 2018 we announced the successful treatment of the first patients globally with Pantheris SV by a vascular surgeon in Münster, Germany. Pantheris SV is available in limited supply for commercial sale in the EU; it is not available for commercial sale in the United States at this time.
 
We have assembled a team with extensive medical device development and commercialization capabilities. In addition to the commercialization of Pantheris in the United States and select international markets in March 2016, we began commercializing our initial non-Lumivascular platform products in 2009 and introduced our Lumivascular platform products in the United States in late 2012. We generated revenues of $10.7 million in 2015, $19.2 million in 2016, $9.9 million in 2017 and $7.9 million in 2018.
 
Our Products
 
Our current products include our Lightbox imaging console and our various catheters used in PAD treatment. All of our revenues are currently derived from sales of our Lightbox imaging console and our various PAD catheters and related services in the United States and select international markets. Each of our current products is, and our future products will be, designed to address significant unmet clinical needs in the treatment of vascular disease.

Lumivascular Platform Overview
 
Our Lumivascular platform integrates OCT visualization with interventional catheters and is the industry’s only system that provides real-time intravascular imaging simultaneously with treatment in PAD procedures. Our Lumivascular platform consists of a capital component, Lightbox, and a variety of disposable catheter products, including Ocelot, Ocelot PIXL, Ocelot MVRX and Pantheris.
Lightbox
 
Lightbox is our proprietary imaging console, which enables the use of Lumivascular catheters during PAD procedures. The console contains an optical transceiver that transmits light into the artery through an optical fiber and displays a cross-sectional image of the vessel to the physician on a high definition monitor during the procedure. Lightbox is configured with two monitors, one for the physicians, and one for the Lightbox technician.
 
Lightbox displays a cross-sectional view of the vessel, which provides physicians with detailed information about the orientation of the catheter and the surrounding artery and plaque. Layered structures represent relatively healthy portions of the artery and non-layered structures represent the plaque that is blocking blood flow in the artery. Navigational markers allow the physician to orient the catheter toward the treatment area, helping to avoid damage to the healthy arterial structures during a procedure. Lightbox received FDA 510(k) clearance in November 2012 and CE Marking in Europe in September 2011.
 
Pantheris
 
We believe Pantheris is the first atherectomy catheter to incorporate real-time OCT intravascular imaging. Pantheris may be used alone or following a CTO crossing procedure using Ocelot or other products. Pantheris is a single-use product and provides physicians with the ability to see a cross-sectional view of the peripheral artery to guide the removal of blockages throughout the procedure. The device restores blood flow by shaving thin strips of plaque using a high-speed directional cutting mechanism that enables physicians to specifically target the portion of the artery where the plaque resides while minimizing disruption to healthy arterial structures. The excised plaque is deposited in the nosecone of the device and removed from the artery within the device.
 
In October 2015, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for commercialization of Pantheris. We made modifications to Pantheris after the completion of the VISION trial and commenced sales in the United States and select international markets following receipt of FDA approval for this version of Pantheris in March 2016. We first received CE Marking for Pantheris in June 2015. We received CE Marking in December 2017 and 501(k) clearance in May 2018 for a next-generation version of Pantheris, which includes new features and design improvements to the handle, shaft, balloon and nose cone of the device. The next-generation Pantheris atherectomy device is available for commercial sale in the United States and select international markets. All previous versions of Pantheris have been discontinued.
 
We are developing a line extension of our Pantheris image-guided atherectomy platform, Pantheris SV (Small Vessel), a lower profile version of Pantheris. The lower profile Pantheris has a smaller diameter and longer length and is designed for use in smaller vessels 2 to 4 millimeters in diameter. We submitted a 510(k) application for Pantheris SV in August 2018 and received CE Marking in October 2018. Pantheris SV is available in limited supply for commercial sale in the EU; it is not available for commercial sale in the United States at this time.

Ocelot, Ocelot PIXL and Ocelot MVRX
 
Ocelot is the first CTO crossing catheter to incorporate real-time OCT imaging, which allows physicians to see the inside of a peripheral artery during a CTO crossing procedure. Physicians have traditionally relied solely on fluoroscopy and tactile feedback to guide catheters through complicated blockages. Ocelot allows physicians to accurately navigate through CTOs by utilizing the OCT images to precisely guide the device through the arterial blockage, while minimizing disruption to the healthy arterial structures. A successful CTO crossing and placement of a guidewire allows the physician to subsequently treat the vessel with a therapeutic device. We received CE Marking for Ocelot in September 2011 and received FDA 510(k) clearance in November 2012.
 
We also offer Ocelot PIXL, a lower profile CTO crossing device for below-the-knee arteries and Ocelot MVRX, which offers a different tip design for peripheral arteries above the knee. We received CE Marking for Ocelot PIXL in October 2012 and received FDA 510(k) clearance in December 2012. We received FDA 510(k) clearance for Ocelot MVRX in December 2012.
 
Other Products
 
Our first-generation CTO crossing catheters, Wildcat and Kittycat, employ a proprietary design that uses a rotational spinning technique, allowing the physician to switch between passive and active modes when navigating across a CTO. Once across the CTO, Wildcat and Kittycat allow for placement of a guidewire and removal of the catheter while leaving the wire in place for additional therapies. Both products require the use of fluoroscopy solely rather than our Lumivascular platform for imaging. Wildcat was our first commercial product and has received both FDA 510(k) clearance in the United States and CE Marking in Europe for crossing peripheral artery CTOs. Kittycat has FDA 510(k) clearance in the United States and CE Marking clearance in Europe for the treatment of peripheral artery CTOs.
Clinical Development
 
We have conducted several clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our products, and we received FDA clearance for Wildcat and Ocelot for CTO crossing in 2011 and 2012, respectively, and for Pantheris in October 2015.
 
CONNECT (Wildcat)
 
Our clinical trial for the Wildcat catheter, known as the CONNECT trial, was a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of Wildcat in crossing CTOs in arteries of the upper leg. The CONNECT trial enrolled 88 patients with CTOs at 15 centers in the United States. Patients were followed for 30 days post-procedure and an independent group of physicians verified the results to determine crossing efficacy and safety endpoints. The CONNECT trial demonstrated that Wildcat was able to cross 89% of CTOs following unsuccessful attempts to cross with standard guidewire techniques. The trial demonstrated a 95% freedom from major adverse events, or MAEs. In the CONNECT trial, MAEs were defined as clinically significant perforations or embolizations and/or Grade C or greater dissections occurring within 30 days of the procedure. These results represent the second-highest reported CTO crossing rate of any published CTO clinical trial, exceeded only by our subsequent CONNECT II clinical trial results.
 
CONNECT II (Ocelot)
 
Our clinical trial for Ocelot, known as CONNECT II, was a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of Ocelot in crossing CTOs in arteries of the upper leg using OCT intravascular imaging. The CONNECT II trial enrolled 100 patients with CTOs at 14 centers in the United States and two centers in Europe. Patients were followed for 30 days post-procedure and an independent group of physicians verified the results to confirm the primary efficacy and safety endpoints. Results from the CONNECT II trial demonstrated that Ocelot surpassed its primary efficacy endpoint by successfully crossing the CTO in 97% of the cases following unsuccessful attempts to cross with standard guidewire techniques. Ocelot achieved these rates with 98% freedom from MAEs.
 
VISION (Pantheris)
 
VISION was our pivotal, non-randomized, prospective, single-arm trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Pantheris across 20 sites within the United States and Europe. The objective of the clinical trial was to demonstrate that Pantheris can be used to effectively remove plaque from diseased lower extremity arteries while using on-board visualization as an adjunct to fluoroscopy. Two groups of patients were treated in VISION: (1) optional roll-ins, which are typically the first two procedures at a site, and (2) the primary cohort, which are the analyzable group of patients. The data for these two groups were reported separately in our 510(k) submission to the FDA. Based on final enrollment, the primary cohort included 130 patients. In March 2015, we completed enrollment of patients in the VISION clinical trial and we submitted for 510(k) clearance from the FDA in August 2015. In October 2015, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for commercialization of Pantheris. We have made modifications to Pantheris subsequent to the completion of VISION and received 510(k) clearance on the enhanced version of Pantheris in March 2016.

VISION’s primary efficacy endpoint required that at least 87% of lesions treated by physicians using Pantheris have a residual stenosis of less than 50%, as verified by an independent core laboratory. The primary safety endpoint required that less than 43% of patients experience an MAE through six-month follow-up as adjudicated by an independent Clinical Events Committee, or CEC. MAEs as defined in VISION included cardiovascular-related death, unplanned major index limb amputation, clinically driven target lesion revascularization, or TLR, heart attack, clinically significant perforation, dissection, embolus, and pseudoaneurysm. Results from the VISION trial demonstrated that Pantheris surpassed its primary efficacy and safety endpoints; residual restenosis of less than 50% was achieved in 96.3% of lesions treated in the primary cohort, while MAEs were experienced in 16.6% of patients.
 
Although not mandated by the FDA to support the market clearance of Pantheris, the protocol for the VISION trial allowed for routine histopathological analysis of the tissue extracted by Pantheris to be conducted. This process allowed us to determine the amount of adventitia present in the tissue, which in turn indicated the extent to which the external elastic lamina had been disrupted during Pantheris procedures. We completed histopathological analysis on tissue from 129 patients in the primary cohort, representing 162 lesions and determined that the average percent area of adventitia was only 1.0% of the total excised tissue. We believe the low level of EEL disruption will correlate to lower restenosis rates and improved long-term outcomes for patients treated with Pantheris, but we do not intend to make any promotional claims to that effect based on the data from this study. We published the results of the histopathological analysis in conjunction with the primary safety and efficacy endpoint data from the VISION trial.
 
Final VISION trial data is summarized in the table below.
 

 | Roll-In Cohort | | Primary Cohort | | Total | 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------+---+-------------------+---+----------+--

Average percent area of adventitia in all lesions with histopathology results | 0.56 | % | 1.02 | % | 0.94 | %

 
Although the original VISION study protocol was not designed to follow patients beyond six months, in 2016 we began working with 18 of the VISION sites to re-consent patients in order for them to be evaluated for patient outcomes through 12 and 24 months following initial treatment. Data collection for patients from participating sites was completed in May 2017, and we released the final 12- and 24-month results for a total of 73 patients and 89 lesions in July 2017. The key metrics reported for this group were freedom from target lesion revascularization, or TLR, at 12 months and 24 months, which were 82% and 74% by patient and 83% and 76% by lesion, respectively, based on Kaplan-Meier curve assessments.
 
INSIGHT (Pantheris)
 
INSIGHT is a prospective, global, single-arm, multi-center study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Pantheris for treating in-stent restenosis in lower extremity arteries. In-stent restenosis occurs when a blocked artery previously treated with a stent becomes narrowed again, thereby reducing blood flow. Physicians often face challenges when treating in-stent restenosis both in terms of safety and efficacy. From a safety standpoint, limitations in imaging techniques, such X-ray fluoroscopy, and the inability to control the directionality of other atherectomy devices create concerns with impacting the integrity of the stent during the procedure. In terms of efficacy, current therapies for in-stent restenosis, such as balloon angioplasty, have high rates of recurrent narrowing within stents.
 
The INSIGHT trial allows for up to 140 patients to be treated at up to 20 sites in the United States and Europe. Patient enrollment began in October 2017 and will continue through 2020. Patient outcomes will be evaluated at thirty days, six months and one year following treatment. We plan to submit a 510(k) application with the FDA seeking a specific indication for treating in-stent restenosis with Pantheris once the trial is fully enrolled and follow-up data through six months are analyzed.

Sales and Marketing
 
We focus our sales and marketing efforts primarily on the approximately 10,000 interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists in the United States that are potential users of our Lumivascular platform products. Our marketing efforts are focused on developing strong relationships with physicians and hospitals that we have identified as key opinion leaders based on their knowledge of our products, clinical expertise and reputation. We also use continuing medical education programs and other opportunities to train interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons, and interventional radiologists in the use of our Lumivascular platform products and educate them as to the benefits of our products as compared to alternative procedures such as angioplasty, stenting, bypass surgery or other atherectomy procedures. In addition, we work with physicians to help them develop their practices and with hospitals to market themselves as centers of excellence in PAD treatment by making our products available to physicians for treating patients.
 
Our sales team currently consists of a Vice President, Regional Directors and Territory Sales Managers, Clinical Specialists, and one Director of International Sales. Territory Sales managers are responsible for all product sales, which include disposable catheters and sale and service of our Lightbox console, while Clinical Specialists are primarily responsible for case coverage and account support. We have an extensive hands-on sales training program, focused on our technologies, Lumivascular image interpretation, case management, sales processes, sales tools and implementing our sales and marketing programs and compliance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations. Our sales team is supported by our marketing team, which focuses primarily on clinical training and education, marketing communications and product management. We have partnered with a third-party field service firm for the installation, service and maintenance of our Lightbox consoles.
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 24 employees focused on sales and marketing. Our sales, general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $17.4 million and $25.1 million, respectively. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues during 2018 or 2017.
 
Competition
 
The medical device industry is highly competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions, results of clinical research, corporate combinations and other factors relating to our industry. Because of the market opportunity and the high growth potential of the PAD treatment market, competitors and potential competitors have historically dedicated, and will continue to dedicate, significant resources to aggressively develop and commercialize their products.
 
Our products compete with a variety of products or devices for the treatment of PAD, including other CTO crossing devices, stents, balloons and atherectomy catheters, as well as products used in vascular surgery. Large competitors in the CTO crossing, stent and balloon market segments include Abbott Laboratories, Becton Dickinson, Boston Scientific, Cardinal Health, Cook Medical, Medtronic and Philips. Competitors in the atherectomy market include Boston Scientific, Cardiovascular Systems, Medtronic and Philips. Some competitors have attempted to combine intravascular imaging with atherectomy and although we are not aware of any active initiatives in this area, these and other companies may attempt to incorporate on-board visualization into their products in the future or may have ongoing programs of which we are not aware. Other competitors include pharmaceutical companies that manufacture drugs for the treatment of symptoms associated with mild to moderate PAD and companies that provide products used by surgeons in peripheral and coronary bypass procedures. These competitors and other companies may introduce new products that compete with our solution.
 
Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, manufacturing, marketing and technical resources than we do. Furthermore, many of our competitors have well-established brands, widespread distribution channels and broader product offerings, and have established stronger and deeper relationships with target customers.
 
To compete effectively, we have to demonstrate that our products are attractive alternatives to other devices and treatments on the basis of:
 

● | procedural safety and efficacy;
--+--------------------------------


● | acute and long-term outcomes;
--+------------------------------


● | ease of use and procedure time;
--+--------------------------------


● | price;
--+-------


● | size and effectiveness of sales force;
--+---------------------------------------


● | radiation exposure for physicians, hospital staff and patients; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | third-party reimbursement.

Intellectual property
 
In order to remain competitive, we must develop and maintain protection of the proprietary aspects of our technologies. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights.
 
It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors to execute non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements on commencement of their employment or engagement. Agreements with our employees also forbid them from using the proprietary rights of third parties in their work for us. We also require confidentiality or material transfer agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials.
 
As of December 31, 2018, we held 23 issued and allowed U.S. patents and had 29 U.S. utility patent applications and 4 PCT applications pending. As of December 31, 2018, we also had 45 issued and allowed patents from outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2018, we had 43 pending patent applications outside of the United States, including in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, India and Japan. As we continue to research and develop our products and technology, we intend to file additional U.S. and foreign patent applications related to the design, manufacture and therapeutic uses of our devices. Our issued patents expire between the years 2028 and 2034.
 
Our patent applications may not result in issued patents and our patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Any patents issued to us may be challenged by third parties as being invalid, or third parties may independently develop similar or competing technology that avoids our patents. The laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.
 
As of December 31, 2018, we held five registered U.S. trademarks. In Europe, we hold three registered trademarks. In addition, we held one International Registration under the Madrid Protocol with granted extensions to China, Europe, Japan, and Korea (reflected in the three European registration noted above)..
 
Research and Development
 
Our ongoing research and development activities are primarily focused on improving and enhancing our Lumivascular platform, specifically our core competency of integrating OCT intravascular imaging onto therapeutic catheters. Our research objectives target areas of unmet clinical need, increase the utility of the Lumivascular platform and adoption of our products by healthcare providers.

● | Product line improvements and extensions. We are developing improvements to our Lumivascular platform, including additional catheters for use in different clinical applications. For example, we are developing versions of Pantheris designed to treat smaller vessels, and we are also developing next-generation CTO crossing devices to target both the peripheral and coronary CTO markets.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Additional treatment indications. We intend to seek additional regulatory clearances from FDA to expand the indications for which our products can be marketed within PAD, as well as in other areas of the body. This includes both expanding the marketed indications for our current products, as well as development of new products.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Next-generation console. We are focusing our console development efforts on miniaturization, equipment integration and increased processing power in anticipation of future catheter products. We may also develop a version of our Lumivascular platform that integrates OCT imaging into existing catheterization lab and operating room imaging systems.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Improved software and user interface. We intend to further develop our software to provide more information and control to our end users during a procedure. We use physician and staff feedback to improve the features and user functionality of our Lumivascular platform.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 10 employees focused on research and development. In addition to our internal team, we retain third-party contractors from time to time to provide us with assistance on specialized projects. We also work closely with experts in the medical community to supplement our internal research and development resources. Research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $6.0 million and $11.3 million, respectively.

Manufacturing
 
Prior to the introduction of our Lumivascular platform, our non-imaging catheter products were manufactured by a third-party. All of our products are now manufactured in-house using components and sub-assemblies manufactured both in-house at our facility in Redwood City, California and by outside vendors. We assemble all of our products at our manufacturing facility but certain critical processes such as coating and sterilization are done by outside vendors. We expect our current manufacturing facility will be sufficient through at least 2019.
 
Order quantities and lead times for components purchased from outside suppliers are based on our forecasts derived from historical demand and anticipated future demand. Lead times for components may vary significantly depending on the size of the order, time required to fabricate and test the components, specific supplier requirements and current market demand for the components and subassemblies. To date, we have not experienced significant delays in obtaining any of our components or subassemblies.
 
We rely on single and limited source suppliers for several of our components and sub-assemblies. For example, we rely on single vendors for our optical fiber and drive cables that are key components of our catheters, and we rely on single vendors for our laser and data acquisition card that are key components of our Lightbox. These components are critical to our products and there are relatively few alternative sources of supply for them. Identifying and qualifying additional or replacement suppliers for any of the components used in our products could involve significant time and cost. Any supply interruption from our vendors or failure to obtain additional vendors for any of the components used to manufacture our products would limit our ability to manufacture our products and could therefore harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Our manufacturing operations are subject to regulatory requirements of 21 CFR part 820 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA; the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, for medical devices sold in the United States, which is enforced by FDA; the Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EEC, which is required for doing business in the European Union; and applicable requirements relating to the environment, waste management and health and safety matters, including measures relating to the release, use, storage, treatment, transportation, discharge, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances, and the sale, labeling, collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of products containing hazardous substances. We cannot ensure that we will not incur material costs or liability in connection with our operations, or that our past or future operations will not result in claims by or injury to employees or the public.
 
Other than through accepted purchase orders, our suppliers have no contractual obligations to supply us with, and we are not contractually obligated to purchase from them, any of our supplies. Any supply interruption from our vendors or failure to obtain additional vendors for any of the components would limit our ability to manufacture our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
We have registered with FDA as a medical device manufacturer and have obtained a manufacturing license from the California Department of Public Health, or CDPH. We and our component suppliers are required to manufacture our products in compliance with FDA’s QSR in 21 CFR part 820 of the FFDCA. The QSR regulates extensively the methods and documentation of the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, quality assurance, packaging, storage and shipping of our products. FDA enforces the QSR through periodic unannounced inspections that may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. Our Quality System has undergone 20 external audits by third-parties and regulatory authorities since 2009, the latest of which was a surveillance audit conducted in January 2017 by BSI, our European Notified Body, under the Medical Device Single Audit Program, or MDSAP. The audit resulted in zero observations of non-conformances.
 
Our failure or the failure of our component suppliers to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shutdown of our manufacturing operations or the recall of our products, which would harm our business. In the event that one of our suppliers fails to maintain compliance with our or governmental quality requirements, we may have to qualify a new supplier and could experience manufacturing delays as a result. We have opted to maintain quality assurance and quality management certifications to enable us to market our products in the member states of the European Union, the European Free Trade Association and countries which have entered into Mutual Recognition Agreements with the European Union. Our Redwood City facilities meet the requirements set forth by ISO 13485:2003 Medical devices—Quality management systems—Requirements for regulatory purposes and MDD 93/42/EEC European Union Council Medical Device Directive.

Government Regulation
 
In general, medical device companies must navigate a challenging regulatory environment. In the United States the FDA regulates the medical device market to ensure the safety and efficacy of these products. The FDA allows for two primary pathways for a medical device to gain approval for commercialization: (i) a pre-market approval, or (ii) PMA application or 510(k) pre-market notification submission. A completely novel product must go through the more rigorous pre-market approval, or PMA, if it cannot receive authorization through a 510(k). The FDA has established three different classes of medical devices that indicate the level of risk associated with using a device and consequent degree of regulatory controls needed to govern its safety and efficacy. Class I and Class II devices are considered lower risk. The lowest risk medical devices can be marketed without a PMA or 510(k) clearance. Other Class I and Class II devices often can gain approval for commercial distribution by submitting an application to the FDA, generally known as the 510(k) process. The devices regarded as the highest risk by the FDA are designated Class III status and generally require the submission of a PMA application for approval to commercialize a product. These generally include life-sustaining, life-supporting, or implantable devices or devices without a known predicate technology already approved by the FDA.
 
The 510(k) clearance path can be significantly less time-consuming and arduous than PMA approval, making this route generally preferable for a medical device company. A 510(k) application must include documentation that its device is substantially equivalent to a technology already cleared through a 510(k) or in distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not required a PMA submission. The FDA has 90 days from the date of the pre-market equivalence acceptance to authorize or decline commercial distribution of the device. However, similar to the PMA process, clearance may take longer than this three-month window, as the FDA can request additional data. If the FDA resolves that the product is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device, then the device acquires a Class III designation, and a PMA must be approved before the device can be commercialized. All of our currently marketed products have received commercial clearance and associated indications for use through the 510(k) regulatory pathway with the FDA, some with the support of clinical data.
 
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) submission and clearance before the modified device can be commercialized. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with the manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with the determination not to seek a new 510(k) clearance or PMA the FDA may retroactively require a new 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval. The FDA could also require a manufacturer to cease marketing and distribution of the modified device and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, a manufacturer may be subject to significant regulatory fines, penalties, and enforcement actions.
 
A PMA application must include reasonable scientific and clinical data that demonstrates the device is safe and effective for the intended uses and indications being sought. The application must also include preclinical testing, technical, manufacturing and labeling information. If the FDA determines the application can undergo substantive review, it has 180 days to review the submission, but it can typically take longer (up to several years) as this regulatory body can request additional information or clarifications. The FDA may also impose additional regulatory hurdles for a PMA, including the institution of an advisory panel of experts to assess the application or provide recommendations as to whether to approve the device. Although the FDA in the end approves or disapproves the device, in nearly all cases the FDA follows the recommendation from the advisory panel. As part of this process, the FDA will usually inspect the manufacturing facilities and operations prior to approval to verify compliance with quality control regulations. Significant changes in the manufacturing of a device, or changes in the intended use, indications and labeling or design of a product require new PMA applications or PMA supplements for a product originally approved under a PMA. This creates substantial regulatory risk for devices undergoing the PMA route.
 
Pervasive and Continuing Regulation
 
After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
 

● | the FDA’s QSR which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label uses; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | clearance or approval of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in intended use;


● | medical device reporting, or MDR, regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 11



The MDR regulations require that we report to the FDA any incident in which our product may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or in which our product malfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury.
 
We have registered with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer and have obtained a manufacturing license from the CDPH. The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. We are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA and the Food and Drug Branch of CDPH to determine our compliance with the QSR and other regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our suppliers. Our current facility has been inspected by the FDA in 2009, 2011 and 2013, and two, three and zero observations, respectively, were noted during those inspections. In the latest FDA audit in 2013, there were no observations that involved a material violation of regulatory requirements, and no non-conformances were noted. Our responses to the observations noted in 2009 and 2011 were accepted by the FDA, and we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the QSR. BSI, our European Notified Body, inspected our facility several times between 2010 and 2015 and found zero non-conformances. BSI conducted four external audits in 2016 and zero non-conformances were found in all except for one audit, for which four minor non-conformances were found. The BSI audit performed in January 2017 resulted in zero non-conformances.
 
Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions:
 

● | warning letters, adverse publicity, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | repair, replacement, refunds, recall or seizure of our products;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


● | operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusing our requests for 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval of new products, new intended uses or modifications to existing products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | withdrawing 510(k) clearance or pre-market approvals that have already been granted; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | criminal prosecution.

Regulatory System for Medical Devices in Europe
 
The European Union consists of 28 member states and has a coordinated system for the authorization of medical devices. The E.U. Medical Devices Directive, or MDD, sets out the basic regulatory framework for medical devices in the European Union. This directive has been separately enacted in more detail in the national legislation of the individual member states of the European Union.
 
The system of regulating medical devices operates by way of a certification for each medical device. Each certificated device is marked with CE marking which shows that the device has a Certificat de Conformité. There are national bodies known as Competent Authorities in each member state which oversee the implementation of the MDD within their jurisdiction. The means for achieving the requirements for CE marking varies according to the nature of the device. Devices are classified in accordance with their perceived risks, similarly to the U.S. system. The class of a product determines the requirements to be fulfilled before CE marking can be placed on a product, known as a conformity assessment. Conformity assessments for our products are carried out as required by the MDD. Each member state can appoint Notified Bodies within its jurisdiction. If a Notified Body of one member state has issued a Certificat de Conformité, the device can be sold throughout the European Union without further conformance tests being required in other member states.
 
Federal, State and Foreign Fraud and Abuse Laws
 
Because of the significant federal funding involved in Medicare and Medicaid, Congress and the states have enacted, and actively enforce, a number of laws to eliminate fraud and abuse in federal healthcare programs. Our business is subject to compliance with these laws. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Healthcare and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, which we refer to collectively as the Affordable Care Act, was enacted in the United States. The provisions of the Affordable Care Act are effective on various dates. The Affordable Care Act expands the government’s investigative and enforcement authority and increases the penalties for fraud and abuse, including amendments to both the Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act, to make it easier to bring suit under these statutes. The Affordable Care Act also allocates additional resources and tools for the government to police healthcare fraud, with expanded subpoena power for HHS, additional funding to investigate fraud and abuse across the healthcare system and expanded use of recovery audit contractors for enforcement.
 
 12



Anti-Kickback Statutes.    The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violation of the Anti-Kickback Statue is a criminal felony, and can result in criminal sanctions, civil penalties, enforcement under the False Claims Act, and exclusion from federal healthcare programs.
 
The definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, certain discounts, the furnishing of free supplies, equipment or services, credit arrangements, payment of cash and waivers of payments. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered businesses, the statute has been violated. Penalties for violations include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. In addition, some kickback allegations have been claimed to violate the Federal False Claims Act, discussed in more detail below.
 
The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are otherwise lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. Recognizing that the Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements, Congress authorized the Office of Inspector General, or OIG, of HHS to issue a series of regulations known as “safe harbors.” These safe harbors set forth provisions that, if all their applicable requirements are met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy an applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities such as OIG.
 
Many states have adopted laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to referral of recipients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
 
Government officials have focused their enforcement efforts on the marketing of healthcare services and products, among other activities, and recently have brought cases against companies, and certain individual sales, marketing and executive personnel, for allegedly offering unlawful inducements to potential or existing customers in an attempt to procure their business.
 
Federal False Claims Act.    Another development affecting the healthcare industry is the increased use of the federal False Claims Act by federal prosecutors, and in particular, action brought pursuant to the False Claims Act’s “whistleblower” or “qui tam” provisions. The False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has violated the False Claims Act and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought against healthcare providers by private individuals has increased dramatically. In addition, various states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the False Claims Act, and many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payor and not just a federal healthcare program.
 
When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties of between $11,181-$22,363 for each separate instance of false claim. As part of any settlement, the government may ask the entity to enter into a corporate integrity agreement, which imposes certain compliance, certification and reporting obligations. There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act. Liability arises, primarily, when an entity knowingly submits, or causes another to submit, a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The federal government has used the False Claims Act to assert liability on the basis of inadequate care, kickbacks and other improper referrals, and improper use of Medicare numbers when detailing the provider of services, in addition to the more predictable allegations as to misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered. In addition, the federal government has prosecuted companies under the False Claims Act in connection with off-label promotion of products. Our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesale or estimated retail prices of our products, the reporting of discount and rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement of our products and the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws.
 
While we are unaware of any current matters, we are unable to predict whether we will be subject to actions under the False Claims Act or a similar state law, or the impact of such actions. However, the costs of defending such claims, as well as any sanctions imposed, could significantly affect our financial performance.

The Sunshine Act.    The Physician Payment Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, which was enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act, requires all United States manufacturers of a prescription drug, device, biologic or other medical supply that has been approved or cleared by the FDA, and is available for coverage by Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the Secretary of HHS: (i) payments or other transfers of value made by that entity, or by a third-party as directed by that entity, to physicians and teaching hospitals or to third parties on behalf of physicians or teaching hospitals; and (ii) physician ownership and investment interests in the drug and device manufacturing entity. The payments required to be reported include the cost of meals provided to a physician, travel reimbursements and other transfers of value, including those provided as part of contracted services such as speaker programs, advisory boards, consultation services and clinical trial services. Failure to comply with the reporting requirements can result in significant civil monetary penalties ranging from $1,000 to $10,000 for each payment or other transfer of value that is not reported (up to a maximum per annual report of $150,000) and from $10,000 to $100,000 for each knowing failure to report (up to a maximum per annual report of $1,150,000). Additionally, there are criminal penalties if an entity intentionally makes false statements in such reports. We are subject to the Sunshine Act and the information we disclose may lead to greater scrutiny, which may result in modifications to established practices and additional costs. Additionally, similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level domestically, and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with healthcare professionals.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.    The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any United States individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, if any, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
International Laws.    In Europe, various countries have adopted anti-bribery laws providing for severe consequences, in the form of criminal penalties and/or significant fines, for individuals and/or companies committing a bribery offense. Violations of these anti-bribery laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation. For instance, in the United Kingdom, under the Bribery Act 2010, which went into effect in July 2011, a bribery occurs when a person offers, gives or promises to give a financial or other advantage to induce or reward another individual to improperly perform certain functions or activities, including any function of a public nature. Bribery of foreign public officials also falls within the scope of the Bribery Act 2010. Under the new regime, an individual found in violation of the Bribery Act of 2010, faces imprisonment of up to 10 years. In addition, the individual can be subject to an unlimited fine, as can commercial organizations for failure to prevent bribery.
 
There are also international privacy laws that impose restrictions on the access, use, and disclosure of health information. All of these laws may impact our business. Our failure to comply with these privacy laws or significant changes in the laws restricting our ability to obtain required patient information could significantly impact our business and our future business plans.
 
U.S. Healthcare Reform
 
Changes in healthcare policy could increase our costs and subject us to additional regulatory requirements that may interrupt commercialization of our current and future solutions. Changes in healthcare policy could increase our costs, decrease our revenues and impact sales of and reimbursement for our current and future solutions. The Affordable Care Act substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts our industry principally by moving healthcare reimbursement towards more value-based and quality-based payment methodologies. The Act contains a number of provisions that impact our business and operations, some of which in ways we cannot currently predict, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs and reimbursement changes.
 
There will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators and third-party payors to reduce costs while expanding individual healthcare benefits. Certain of these changes could impose additional limitations on the prices we will be able to charge for our current and future solutions or the amounts of reimbursement available for our current and future solutions from governmental agencies or third-party payors. Furthermore, the current presidential administration and Congress may again attempt broad sweeping changes to the current healthcare laws. We face uncertainties that might result from modification or repeal of any of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act, including as a result of current and future executive orders and legislative actions. The impact of those changes on us and potential effect on the medical device industry as a whole is currently unknown. But, any changes to the Affordable Care Act are likely to have an impact on our results of operations, and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We cannot predict what other healthcare programs and regulations will ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect any future legislation or regulation in the United States may have on our business.
 
Third-Party Reimbursement
 
Payment for patient care in the United States is generally made by third-party payors, including private insurers and government insurance programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. The Medicare program, the largest single payor in the United States, is a federal governmental health insurance program administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, and covers certain medical care expenses for eligible elderly and disabled individuals. Because a large percentage of the population with PAD includes Medicare beneficiaries, and private insurers may follow the coverage and payment policies of Medicare, Medicare’s coverage and payment policies are significant to our operations.
 
 14



Medicare pays PAD treatment facilities, including hospitals and physician office-based labs, pre-determined amounts for each procedure performed. These payment amounts differ based on a variety of factors, including:
 

• | Type of procedure performed—angioplasty, stent or atherectomy;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | Patient-specific complexities and comorbidities;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | Type of facility—hospital, teaching hospital or office-based lab;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Inpatient or outpatient status; and
--+------------------------------------


• | Geographic region.
--+-------------------

 
We receive payment from the treatment facility for our products, and the Medicare reimbursement to the facility is intended to cover the overall cost of treatment, including the cost of products used during the procedure as well as the overhead cost associated with the facility where the procedure is performed. For procedures performed in hospitals, the physician who performs the procedure is reimbursed separately under the Medicare physician fee schedule. Claims for PAD procedures are typically submitted by the treatment facility and physician to Medicare or other health insurers using established billing codes. These codes identify the procedures performed and are relied upon to determine third-party payor reimbursement amounts.
 
Medicare reimbursement for inpatient PAD procedures that include atherectomy for 2019 went into effect on October 1, 2018 and range between approximately $11,000 and $19,000. These amounts include the cost of disposable catheters such as Ocelot and Pantheris. While reimbursement varies based on the type of procedure performed (e.g., angioplasty, stent or atherectomy), additional device-specific reimbursement is not available. The amount of reimbursement can vary substantially by geographical region and by facility. Payment rates of other third-party payors may follow Medicare rates, or they may be higher or lower, depending on their particular reimbursement methodology. Because of the wide variability, it is not possible to identify an average rate for third-party payors other than Medicare.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 75 employees, including 22 in manufacturing and operations, 24 in sales and marketing, 10 in research and development and clinical and regulatory affairs, 8 in quality assurance and 11 in finance, general administrative and executive administration. Of these 75 employees, 5 are part time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are parties to a collective bargaining agreement and we believe that our employee relations are good.
