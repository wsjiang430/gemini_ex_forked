ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
Star Alliance International Corp. (“the Company”, “we”, “us”) was originally incorporated with the name Asteriko Corp. in the State of Nevada on April 17, 2014 under the laws of the state of Nevada. Our prior business plans, which generated limited or no earnings, included interior decorating products, and a travel and tourism service.

 
On May 14, 2018, Richard Carey our President and Chairman of the Board, acquired 22,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company, representing 62.15% ownership of the Company which constitutes control. Mr. Carey accepted the positions of President and Chairman of the Board on the same day.
 
On May 17, 2018, Mr. Carey appointed Alexei Tchernov as CEO and Director, Franz Allmayer as Vice President and Director, John C. Baird as CFO and Director and Themis Glatman as Secretary and Director. Also see Note 4.
 
The Company is intending to acquire two mines and an intellectual property which is a gold extraction process following the conventional principles of heap leaching for the extraction of gold in oxidized minerals accelerating the rate of dissolution of gold to nearly an immediate rate, reducing the standard time of extraction. 
 
In August 14, 2018, the Company entered into an Exclusive Option Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Starving Lion, Inc. (“Lion”). Under the Agreement, the Company has been granted the exclusive option, for a period of six (6) months, to acquire the assets from Starving Lion, Inc. specified under the June 4, 2018 Letter of Intent. The assets pertain mainly to two mines located in Guatemala; one is a magnesium mine in El Progresso, and the other is a gold mine in Livingston. 
 
The required purchase price for the Starving Lion, Inc. assets will be $1,000,000 cash, together with the issuance to Lion of new common and/or preferred stock to represent fifty-eight percent (58%) of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock on a fully-diluted, post-closing basis. 
 
In the event that the Company is able to acquire the above assets, its business focus will shift to the pursuit of mining and mining technology businesses currently conducted by Lion as described above. The Company’s ability to successfully acquire the above assets is contingent upon obtaining additional financing sufficient to pay the cash portion of the purchase price. As of the current date no assets have been transferred as the Company is still in the due diligence period.
 
Employees 
 
Management of the Company expect to use consultants, attorneys and accountants as necessary, and does not anticipate a need to engage any full-time employees so long as it is seeking and evaluating business opportunities. The need for employees and their availability will be addressed in connection with the decision whether or not to acquire or participate in specific business opportunities. 
Smaller Reporting Company Status 
 
We qualify as a “smaller reporting company” under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, which is defined as a company with a public equity float of less than $75 million. To the extent that we remain a smaller reporting company at such time as are no longer an emerging growth company, we will still have reduced disclosure requirements for our public filings, some of which are similar to those of an emerging growth company, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements.
