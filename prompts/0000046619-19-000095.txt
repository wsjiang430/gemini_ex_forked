Item 1.    BUSINESS
The Company
HEICO Corporation through its subsidiaries (collectively, “HEICO,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company”) believes it is the world’s largest manufacturer of Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”)-approved jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts, other than the original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and their subcontractors.  HEICO also believes it is a leading manufacturer of various types of electronic equipment for the aviation, defense, space, medical, telecommunications and electronics industries.
The Company was originally organized in 1957 as a holding company known as HEICO Corporation.  As part of a reorganization completed in 1993, the original holding company (formerly known as HEICO Corporation) was renamed as HEICO Aerospace Corporation and a new holding corporation known as HEICO Corporation was created.  The reorganization did not result in any change in the business of the Company, its consolidated assets or liabilities or the relative interests of its shareholders.
Our business is comprised of two operating segments:
The Flight Support Group. Our Flight Support Group (“FSG”), consisting of HEICO Aerospace Holdings Corp. and HEICO Flight Support Corp. and their collective subsidiaries, accounted for 60%, 62% and 63% of our net sales in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  The Flight Support Group uses proprietary technology to design and manufacture jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts for sale at lower prices than those manufactured by OEMs.  These parts are approved by the FAA and are the functional equivalent of parts sold by OEMs.  In addition, the Flight Support Group repairs, overhauls and distributes jet engine and aircraft components, avionics and instruments for domestic and foreign commercial air carriers and aircraft repair companies as well as military and business aircraft operators; and manufactures thermal insulation products, complex composite assemblies, and other component parts primarily for aerospace, defense, industrial and commercial applications.
The Electronic Technologies Group. Our Electronic Technologies Group (“ETG”), consisting of HEICO Electronic Technologies Corp. and its subsidiaries, accounted for 40%, 38% and 37% of our net sales in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  The Electronic Technologies Group derived approximately 64%, 65% and 64% of its net sales in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, from the sale of products and services to United States ("U.S.") and foreign military agencies, prime defense contractors and both commercial and defense satellite and spacecraft manufacturers. The ETG designs, manufactures and sells various types of electronic, data and microwave, and electro-optical products, including infrared simulation and test equipment, laser rangefinder receivers, electrical power supplies, back-up power supplies, power conversion products, underwater locator beacons, emergency locator transmission beacons, electromagnetic and radio frequency interference shielding, high power capacitor

HEICO has continuously operated in the aerospace industry for over 60 years. Since assuming control in 1990, our current management has achieved significant sales and profit growth through a broadened line of product offerings, an expanded customer base, increased research and development expenditures and the completion of a number of acquisitions.  As a result of internal growth and acquisitions, our net sales from continuing operations have grown from $26.2 million in fiscal 1990 to $2,055.6 million in fiscal 2019, representing a compound annual growth rate of approximately 16%.  During the same period, we improved our net income from $2.0 million to $327.9 million, representing a compound annual growth rate of approximately 19%.
Disciplined Acquisition Strategy
Acquisitions have been an important element of our growth strategy over the past twenty-nine years, supplementing our organic growth.  Since 1990, we have completed approximately 77 acquisitions complementing the niche segments of the aviation, defense, space, medical, telecommunications and electronics industries in which we operate.  We typically target acquisition opportunities that allow us to broaden our product offerings, services and technologies while expanding our customer base and geographic presence.  Even though we have historically pursued an active acquisition policy, our disciplined acquisition strategy involves limiting acquisition candidates to businesses that we believe will continue to grow, offer strong cash flow and earnings potential, and are available at fair prices. See Note 2, Acquisitions, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our recent acquisitions.

Flight Support Group
The Flight Support Group serves a broad spectrum of the aviation industry, including (i) commercial airlines and air cargo carriers; (ii) repair and overhaul facilities; (iii) OEMs; and (iv) U.S. and foreign governments.
The Flight Support Group competes with the leading industry OEMs and, to a lesser extent, with a number of smaller, independent parts distributors.  Historically, the three principal jet engine OEMs, General Electric (including CFM International), Pratt & Whitney and Rolls Royce, have been the sole source of substantially all jet engine replacement parts for their jet engines.  Other OEMs have been the sole source of replacement parts for their aircraft component parts.  While we believe that we currently supply approximately 2% of the market for jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts, we have in recent years been adding new products to our line at a rate of approximately 300 to 500 Parts Manufacturer Approvals (“PMA” or “PMAs”) per year.  We have developed for our customers approximately 11,200 parts for which PMAs have been received from the FAA.
Jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts can be categorized by their ongoing ability to be repaired and returned to service.  The general categories in which we participate are as follows: (i) rotable; (ii) repairable; and (iii) expendable.  A rotable is a part which is removed periodically as dictated by an operator’s maintenance procedures or on an as needed basis and is typically repaired or overhauled and re-used an indefinite number of times.  An important subset of rotables is “life limited” parts.  A life limited rotable has a designated number of allowable flight hours and/or cycles (one take-off and landing generally constitutes one cycle) after which it is rendered unusable.  A repairable is similar to a rotable except that it can only be repaired a limited number of times before it must be discarded.  An expendable is generally a part which is used and not thereafter repaired for further use.
Jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts are classified within the industry as (i) factory-new; (ii) new surplus; (iii) overhauled; (iv) repairable; and (v) as removed.  A factory-new or new surplus part is one that has never been installed or used.  Factory-new parts are purchased from FAA-approved manufacturers (such as HEICO or OEMs) or their authorized distributors.  New surplus parts are purchased from excess stock of airlines, repair facilities or other redistributors.  An overhauled part is one that has been completely repaired and inspected by a licensed repair facility such as ours.  An aircraft spare part is classified as “repairable” if it can be repaired by a licensed repair facility under applicable regulations.  A part may also be classified as “repairable” if it can be removed by the operator from an aircraft or jet engine while operating under an approved maintenance program and is airworthy and meets any manufacturer or time and cycle restrictions applicable to the part.  A “factory-new,” “new surplus” or “overhauled” part designation indicates that the part can be immediately utilized on an aircraft.  A part in “as removed” or “repairable” condition requires inspection and possibly functional testing, repair or overhaul by a licensed facility prior to being returned to service in an aircraft.

Factory-New Jet Engine and Aircraft Component Replacement Parts.  The Flight Support Group engages in the research and development, design, manufacture and sale of FAA-approved replacement parts that are sold to domestic and foreign commercial air carriers and aircraft repair and overhaul companies.  Our principal competitors are aircraft engine and aircraft component manufacturers.  The Flight Support Group’s factory-new replacement parts include various jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts.  A key element of our growth strategy is the continued design and development of an increasing number of PMA replacement parts in order to further penetrate our existing customer base and obtain new customers.  We select the jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts to design and manufacture through a selection process which analyzes industry information to determine which replacement parts are suitable candidates.
Repair and Overhaul Services.  The Flight Support Group provides repair and overhaul services on selected jet engine and aircraft component parts, as well as on avionics, instruments, composites and flight surfaces of commercial aircraft operated by domestic and foreign commercial airlines.  The Flight Support Group also provides repair and overhaul services including avionics and navigation systems as well as subcomponents and other instruments utilized on military aircraft operated by the U.S. government and foreign military agencies and for aircraft repair and overhaul companies.  Our repair and overhaul operations require a high level of expertise, advanced technology and sophisticated equipment.  Services include the repair, refurbishment and overhaul of numerous accessories and parts mounted on gas turbine engines and airframes.  Components overhauled include fuel pumps, generators, fuel controls, pneumatic valves, starters and actuators, turbo compressors and constant speed drives, hydraulic pumps, valves and actuators, wheels and brakes, composite flight controls, electro-mechanical equipment, auxiliary power unit accessories and thrust reverse actuation systems.  Some of the repair and overhaul services provided by the Flight Support Group are proprietary repairs approved by an FAA-qualified designated engineering representative (“DER”) and/or by the owner/operator.  Such proprietary repairs typically create cost savings or provide engineering flexibility.  The Flight Support Group also provides commercial airlines, regional operators, asset management companies and Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (“MRO”) providers with high quality and cost effective niche accessory component exchange services as an alternative to OEMs’ spares services.
Distribution.  The Flight Support Group distributes FAA-approved parts including hydraulic, pneumatic, structural, interconnect, mechanical and electro-mechanical components for the commercial, regional and general aviation markets.  The Flight Support Group also is a leading supplier, distributor, and integrator of military aircraft parts and support services primarily to foreign military organizations allied with the U.S. Further, we believe the Flight Support Group is a leading provider of products and services necessary to maintain up-to-date F-16 fighter aircraft operational capabilities. 
Manufacture of Specialty Aircraft/Defense Related Parts and Subcontracting for OEMs.  The Flight Support Group engineers, designs and manufactures thermal insulation blankets and parts as well as renewable/reusable insulation systems primarily for aerospace, defense, commercial and industrial applications.  The Flight Support Group also manufactures 
Index

specialty components for sale as a subcontractor for aerospace and industrial original equipment manufacturers and the U.S. government. Additionally, the Flight Support Group manufactures advanced niche components and complex composite assemblies for commercial aviation, defense and space applications, and manufactures expanded foil mesh, which is integrated into composite aerospace structures for lightning strike protection in fixed and rotary wing aircraft.
FAA Approvals and Product Design.  Non-OEM manufacturers of jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts must receive a PMA from the FAA to sell the replacement part.  The PMA approval process includes the submission of sample parts, drawings and testing data to one of the FAA’s Aircraft Certification Offices where the submitted data are analyzed.  We believe that an applicant’s ability to successfully complete the PMA process is limited by several factors, including (i) the agency’s confidence level in the applicant; (ii) the complexity of the part; (iii) the volume of PMAs being filed; and (iv) the resources available to the FAA.  We also believe that companies such as HEICO that have demonstrated their advanced design engineering and manufacturing capabilities, including an established favorable track record with the FAA, generally receive a faster turnaround time in the processing of PMA applications.  Finally, we believe that the PMA process creates a significant barrier to entry in this market niche through both its technical demands and its limits on the rate at which competitors can bring products to market.
As part of our growth strategy, we have continued to increase our research and development activities.  Research and development expenditures by the Flight Support Group, which were approximately $.3 million in fiscal 1991, increased to approximately $23.8 million in fiscal 2019, $21.3 million in fiscal 2018 and $17.9 million in fiscal 2017.  We believe that our Flight Support Group’s research and development capabilities are a significant component of our historical success and an integral part of our growth strategy.  In recent years, the FAA granted us PMAs for approximately 300 to 500 new parts and we develop approximately 300 to 400 new proprietary repairs per year; however, no assurance can be given that the FAA will continue to grant PMAs or DER-approved repairs or that we will achieve acceptable levels of net sales and gross profits on such parts or repairs in the future.
We benefit from our proprietary rights relating to certain design, engineering and manufacturing processes and repair and overhaul procedures.  Customers often rely on us to provide initial and additional components, as well as to redesign, re-engineer, replace or repair and provide overhaul services on such aircraft components at every stage of their useful lives.  In addition, for some products, our unique manufacturing capabilities are required by the customer’s specifications or designs, thereby necessitating reliance on us for production of such designed products.
We have no material patents for the proprietary techniques, including software and manufacturing expertise, we have developed to manufacture jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts and instead, we primarily rely on trade secret protection.  Although our proprietary techniques and software and manufacturing expertise are subject to misappropriation or obsolescence, we believe that we take appropriate measures to prevent misappropriation or obsolescence from occurring by developing new techniques and improving existing methods and 
Index

processes, which we will continue on an ongoing basis as dictated by the technological needs of our business.
We believe that, based on our competitive pricing, reputation for high quality, short lead time requirements, strong relationships with domestic and foreign commercial air carriers and repair stations (companies that overhaul aircraft engines and/or components), and successful track record of receiving PMAs and repair approvals from the FAA and commercial air carriers, we are uniquely positioned to continue to increase the products and services offered and gain market share.
Electronic Technologies Group
Our Electronic Technologies Group’s strategy is to design and manufacture highly-engineered, mission-critical subcomponents that must successfully operate in the harshest environments, for smaller, niche markets, but which are utilized in larger systems – systems like power, targeting, tracking, identification, simulation, testing, communications, lighting, surgical, medical imaging, baggage scanning, telecom and computer systems.  These systems are, in turn, often located on another platform, such as aircraft, rotorcraft, satellites, ships, spacecraft, land vehicles, handheld devices and other platforms.

Distribution, Sales, Marketing and Customers
Each of our operating segments independently conducts distribution, sales and marketing efforts directed at their respective customers and industries and, in some cases, collaborates with other operating divisions and subsidiaries within its group for cross-marketing efforts.  Sales and marketing efforts are conducted primarily by in-house personnel and, to a lesser extent, by independent manufacturers’ representatives.  Generally, our in-house sales personnel receive a base salary plus commissions and manufacturers’ representatives receive a commission based on sales.
We believe that direct relationships are crucial to establishing and maintaining a strong customer base and, accordingly, our senior management is actively involved in our marketing activities, particularly with established customers.  We are also a member of various trade and business organizations related to the commercial aviation industry, such as the Aerospace Industries Association, which we refer to as AIA, the leading trade association representing the nation’s manufacturers of commercial, military and business aircraft, aircraft engines and related components and equipment.  Due in large part to our established industry presence, we enjoy strong customer relations, name recognition and repeat business.
We sell our products to a broad customer base consisting of domestic and foreign commercial and cargo airlines, repair and overhaul facilities, other aftermarket suppliers of aircraft engine and airframe materials, OEMs, domestic and foreign military units, electronic manufacturing services companies, manufacturers for the defense industry as well as medical, telecommunications, scientific, and industrial companies.  No one customer accounted for sales of 10% or more of total consolidated sales from continuing operations during any of the last three fiscal years.  Net sales to our five largest customers accounted for approximately 20%, 20% and 18% of total net sales in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Competition
The aerospace product and service industry is characterized by intense competition. Some of our competitors have substantially greater name recognition, inventories, complementary product and service offerings, financial, marketing and other resources than we do.  As a result, such competitors may be able to respond more quickly to customer requirements than we can.  Moreover, smaller competitors may be in a position to offer more attractive pricing as a result of lower labor costs and other factors.
Our jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts business competes primarily with aircraft engine and aircraft component OEMs.  The competition is principally based on price and service to the extent that our parts are interchangeable.  With respect to other aerospace products and services sold by the Flight Support Group, we compete with both the leading jet engine and aircraft component OEMs and a large number of machining, fabrication, distribution and repair companies, some of which have greater financial and other resources than we do.  Competition is based mainly on price, product performance, service and technical capability.
Index

Competition for the repair and overhaul of jet engine and aircraft components and avionics and navigation systems as well as the manufacture of specialty aircraft and defense related parts comes from three principal sources: OEMs, major commercial airlines and other independent service companies.  Some of these competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do.  Some major commercial airlines own and operate their own service centers and sell repair and overhaul services to other aircraft operators.  Foreign airlines that provide repair and overhaul services typically provide these services for their own aircraft components and for third parties.  OEMs also maintain service centers that provide repair and overhaul services for the components they manufacture.  Other independent service organizations also compete for the repair and overhaul business of other users of aircraft components.  We believe that the principal competitive factors in the repair and overhaul market are quality, turnaround time, overall customer service and price.
Our Electronic Technologies Group competes with several large and small domestic and foreign competitors, some of which have greater financial and other resources than we do.  The markets for our electronic, data and microwave, and electro-optical equipment products are niche markets with several competitors where competition is based mainly on design, technology, quality, price, service and customer satisfaction.
Raw Materials
We purchase a variety of raw materials, primarily consisting of high temperature alloy sheet metal and castings, forgings, pre-plated metals and electrical components from various vendors.  The materials used by our operations are generally available from a number of sources and in sufficient quantities to meet current requirements subject to normal lead times. We are subject to rules promulgated by the Securities Exchange Commission pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act regarding the use of certain materials (tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten), known as conflict minerals, which are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. These rules may impose additional costs and may introduce new risks related to our ability to verify the origin of any conflict minerals used in our products. 
Backlog
Our total backlog was $900 million as of October 31, 2019 as compared to $783 million as of October 31, 2018. The majority of our backlog of orders as of October 31, 2019 is expected to be filled during fiscal 2020. The Electronic Technologies Group’s backlog of unshipped orders was $575 million as of October 31, 2019 as compared to $472 million as of October 31, 2018. The increase in the Electronic Technologies Group's backlog reflects increased orders at one of our businesses that designs and produces mission-extending, crashworthy and ballistically self-sealing auxiliary fuel systems for military rotorcraft as well as the backlogs of businesses acquired during fiscal 2019. The Flight Support Group’s backlog of unshipped orders was $325 million as of October 31, 2019 as compared to $311 million as of October 31, 2018.  This backlog excludes forecasted shipments for certain contracts of the Flight Support Group pursuant to which customers provide only estimated annual usage and not firm 
Index

purchase orders.  Our backlogs within the Flight Support Group are typically short-lead in nature with many product orders being received within the month of shipment. 
Government Regulation
The FAA regulates the manufacture, repair and operation of all aircraft and aircraft parts operated in the United States.  Its regulations are designed to ensure that all aircraft and aviation equipment are continuously maintained in proper condition to ensure safe operation of the aircraft.  Similar rules apply in other countries.  All aircraft must be maintained under a continuous condition monitoring program and must periodically undergo thorough inspection and maintenance.  The inspection, maintenance and repair procedures for the various types of aircraft and equipment are prescribed by regulatory authorities and can be performed only by certified repair facilities utilizing certified technicians.  Certification and conformance is required prior to installation of a part on an aircraft.  Aircraft operators must maintain logs concerning the utilization and condition of aircraft engines, life-limited engine parts and airframes.  In addition, the FAA requires that various maintenance routines be performed on aircraft engines, some engine parts, and airframes at regular intervals based on cycles or flight time.  Engine maintenance must also be performed upon the occurrence of certain events, such as foreign object damage in an aircraft engine or the replacement of life-limited engine parts.  Such maintenance usually requires that an aircraft engine be taken out of service.  Our operations may in the future be subject to new and more stringent regulatory requirements.  In that regard, we closely monitor the FAA and industry trade groups in an attempt to understand how possible future regulations might impact us.  Our businesses which sell defense products directly to the U.S. Government or for use in systems delivered to the U.S. Government can be subject to various laws and regulations governing pricing and other factors.
There has been no material adverse effect to our consolidated financial statements as a result of these government regulations.
Environmental Regulation
Our operations are subject to extensive, and frequently changing, federal, state and local environmental laws and substantial related regulation by government agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency.  Among other matters, these regulatory authorities impose requirements that regulate the operation, handling, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials; protect the health and safety of workers; and require us to obtain and maintain licenses and permits in connection with our operations.  This extensive regulatory framework imposes significant compliance burdens and risks on us.  Notwithstanding these burdens, we believe that we are in material compliance with all federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations governing our operations.

There has been no material adverse effect to our consolidated financial statements as a result of these environmental regulations.
Index

Other Regulation
We are also subject to a variety of other regulations including work-related and community safety laws.  The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 mandates general requirements for safe workplaces for all employees and established the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) in the Department of Labor.  In particular, OSHA provides special procedures and measures for the handling of certain hazardous and toxic substances.  In addition, specific safety standards have been promulgated for workplaces engaged in the treatment, disposal or storage of hazardous waste.  Requirements under state law, in some circumstances, may mandate additional measures for facilities handling materials specified as extremely dangerous.  We believe that our operations are in material compliance with OSHA’s health and safety requirements.
Insurance
We are a named insured under policies which include the following coverage: (i) product liability, including grounding; (ii) personal property, inventory and business interruption at our facilities; (iii) general liability coverage; (iv) employee benefit liability; (v) international liability and automobile liability; (vi) umbrella liability coverage; and (vii) various other activities or items, each subject to certain limits and deductibles.  We believe that our insurance coverage is adequate to insure against the various liability risks of our business.
Employees
As of October 31, 2019, we had approximately 5,900 full-time and part-time employees including approximately 3,400 in the Flight Support Group and approximately 2,500 in the Electronic Technologies Group. None of our employees are represented by a U.S. domestic union.  Our management believes that we have good relations with our employees.
