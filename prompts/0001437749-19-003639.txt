Overview
 
Lindblad provides expedition cruising and adventure travel experiences using itineraries that feature up-close encounters with wildlife, nature, history and culture, and promote guest empowerment and interactivity. Our mission is to offer life-changing adventures around the world and pioneer innovative ways to allow our guests to connect with exotic and remote places. Our expedition ships are customized, nimble and intimately-scaled vessels that are able to venture where larger cruise ships cannot, thus allowing us to offer up-close experiences in the planet’s wild and remote places and capitals of culture. Many of these expeditions involve travel to remote places with limited infrastructure and ports (such as Antarctica and the Arctic), including places that are best accessed by a ship (such as the Galápagos, the Alaskan coast and Baja California’s Sea of Cortez), and foster active engagement by guests. Each expedition ship is designed to be comfortable and inviting, while being fully equipped with state-of-the-art tools for in-depth exploration. In addition to our sea-based expeditions, we offer land-based, eco-conscious expeditions across the globe from Antarctica to Zimbabwe primarily through our Natural Habitat, Inc. (“Natural Habitat”) subsidiary.
 
We choose to visit geographic areas based upon many factors, including weather, marine conditions, migration patterns and various natural phenomena. We continue to expand our travel offerings. In the northern hemisphere summer months, we primarily visit the High Arctic regions of the world, Alaska, the Canadian Maritimes, Europe, as well as the South Pacific. In the northern hemisphere winter months, we primarily travel to Antarctica, South America, Costa Rica, Baja California and the Caribbean. The Galápagos Islands are a year-round destination offering a diverse variety of marine, land and airborne wildlife.
 
We currently operate a fleet of eight owned expedition ships and five seasonal charter vessels, having recently launched a new owned expedition ship, the National Geographic Venture, in December 2018. In addition, we are building a new polar ice class vessel, the National Geographic Endurance, for delivery in January 2020 and in February 2019, we entered into an agreement with Ulstein Verft to construct a second polar ice class vessel, a sister ship of the National Geographic Endurance, with a total purchase price of 1,291.0 million Norwegian Kroner (NOK). The purchase price is subject to potential adjustments from contract specifications for variations in speed, deadweight, fuel consumption and delivery date and is due in installments, with the first 20% to be paid shortly after execution of the agreement, 50% to be paid over the duration of the build and the final 30% due upon delivery and acceptance of the vessel. The vessel is targeted to be delivered in September 2021.
 
We deploy chartered vessels for various seasonal offerings and continually seek to optimize our charter fleet to balance our inventory with demand and maximize yields. We use our charter inventory as a mechanism to both increase travel options for our existing and prospective guests and also to test demand for certain areas and seasons to understand the potential for longer term deployments and additional vessel needs.
 
Our offerings appeal to a wide range of travelers, both individuals and families, with affluent individuals in the U.S. aged 50 years or older representing our largest demographic category. The quality of our offerings has enabled us to achieve and maintain premium pricing in the market instead of pursuing the type of discounting in which most large cruise lines that are focused on the broader market engage. Our product offering, value proposition and differentiated pricing approach have enabled us to achieve high net yields and occupancy rates.
 
We have a longstanding relationship with the National Geographic Society, which was founded on a shared interest in exploration, research, technology and conservation. This relationship includes co-selling, co-marketing and branding arrangements with National Geographic Partners, LLC (“National Geographic”) whereby our owned vessels carry the National Geographic name and National Geographic sells our expeditions through their internal travel divisions. We collaborate with National Geographic on expedition planning to enhance the guest experience by having National Geographic experts, including photographers, writers, marine biologists, naturalists, field researchers and film crews, join our expeditions. Guests have the ability to interface with these experts through lectures, excursions, dining and other experiences throughout their expedition.
 
Our business benefits from significant visibility into future revenues, as our guests generally plan and book their voyages far in advance of their departure dates. As of February 26, 2019, 87% of the Lindblad segment’s expected guest ticket revenues for 2019 have been booked.
 
Natural Habitat specializes in nature adventures, providing life-transforming forays into the natural world that benefit wild habitats and the animals and people who live there. Our travel adventures provide unparalleled access to the planet's most extraordinary wildlife, landscapes and cultures. We provide unique itineraries that include access to private wildlife reserves, remote corners of national parks and distinctive, secluded and remote lodges and camps situated where wildlife viewing is best. Because of our commitment to environmentally friendly travel and the exceptional quality of our worldwide adventures, we have partnered with World Wildlife Fund (“WWF”) as their exclusive conservation travel partner. Through our relationship with WWF, their top scientists and staff collaborate with us in planning journeys to the world’s most captivating nature destinations.

Lindblad Expeditions Ships and Voyages
 Itineraries
 Currently we operate a fleet of eight owned expedition vessels and five seasonal chartered ships to provide our signature marine-based adventures to over 40 destinations on six continents, offering itineraries that last from four to 21 days. We have extensive experience operating in the Galápagos Islands, Alaska, Antarctica and the Arctic, with the Lindblad family having been among the first to bring non-scientist travelers to these regions. We currently operate two vessels providing itineraries in the Galápagos throughout the year. We operate two polar vessels that serve primarily in Antarctica during the northern hemisphere winter, in the Arctic during the northern hemisphere summer and various destinations during the intermediate months. We also operate four ships in Alaska during the summer months that travel south along the North American coastline to the Sea of Cortez, Belize, Guatemala, Costa Rica and Panama for the winter. In addition, we charter five vessels for seasonal itineraries in the Amazon, Scotland, the Caribbean, the Mediterranean, Cambodia and Vietnam, and Egypt.
 
We place a strong focus on innovation, which we seek to achieve by introducing new expedition options and continuously making improvements to our fleet and voyage experiences as new technology or operating procedures are developed. We make deployment decisions with the goal of optimizing the overall profitability of our portfolio, with these decisions generally made 18 to 24 months in advance. Our occupancy rates were 91%, 87% and 90% for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, indicating strong consumer interest in our offerings. Adding new capacity will allow us to expand our inventory of existing itineraries, extend into new markets and explore new destinations. The following table presents summary information concerning the ships we currently operate and their geographic areas of operation based on 2019 itineraries:

Ship Repair and Maintenance
 
In addition to routine repairs and maintenance performed on an ongoing basis and in accordance with applicable requirements, each of our expedition ships is taken out of service for a scheduled deeper maintenance period to conduct repairs and improvements. We maintain our fleet in accordance with applicable regulations, international conventions and insurance requirements. This includes regularly scheduled maintenance, periodic inspections, drydocking, wetdocking and overhaul. In addition, renovations and replacements of various vessel elements are part of the ongoing process of maintaining the vessels to a high standard of reliability.
 
For U.S. flagged ships, the statutory requirement is an annual docking and U.S. Coast Guard inspections, normally conducted in drydock. Internationally flagged ships have scheduled dockings approximately every 12 months, for a period of up to three to six weeks. Drydock interval and required inspections are statutory requirements controlled under chapters of the International Convention of the Safety of Life at Seas (“SOLAS”) and Classification Society instructions. Under these regulations, passenger ships must be inspected in drydock twice in five years, with the maximum duration between each drydock inspection not to exceed three years, and an underwater hull inspection is required annually. To the extent practicable each ship’s crew and hotel staff remain with the ship during docking periods and assist in performing repair and maintenance work. Dockings are typically planned during non-peak demand periods to minimize the adverse effect on revenue that results from ships being out of service.
 
Guest Activities and Services
 
We provide our guests the opportunity and the tools to be active and engaged explorers. Our vessels carry a variety of equipment for exploration which, depending on the ship and destination, may include Zodiacs for water-based activities and quick transfers to shore, kayaks for personal exploration, motorized skiffs, an underwater camera, a remotely operated vehicle, a video microscope to study some of the smallest organisms of the marine ecosystem, a crow’s nest camera atop a ship’s mast, hydrophones for listening to vocalizations of marine mammals, snorkeling gear, scuba gear and wetsuits. An experienced and knowledgeable expedition staff leads guests in exploration while Zodiac riding, hiking onshore, paddling on the water or observing wildlife from ashore or onboard the ship. All voyages feature a certified photo instructor onboard and many include photographers from National Geographic.
 
Our ships allow us to offer guests authentic, up-close experiences in the planet's wild, remote places, but at the same time, enjoy a high level of comfort, convenience and safety. High-quality dining is an integral part of our expedition experience with influences and flavors that reflect the regions being explored, along with traditional fare. Food prepared aboard is sourced locally whenever practicable from sustainable providers. Seating is open and the atmosphere is relaxed. Our ships offer a range of services and amenities which allow our guests to travel in comfort. Depending on the ship, these may include a fitness center, a spa offering a variety of treatments, a photo kiosk for photographers to edit and sort photos, 24-hour beverage service, internet connection, laundry facilities and a doctor on call.
 
We offer to handle virtually all travel aspects related to guest reservations and transportation, simplifying the planning and booking process for our guests. We also provide guests the opportunity to purchase pre- and post-expedition extensions or services that may include additional hotel nights, air travel, private transfers, excursions, land travel packages and travel protection insurance.

Competitive Strengths
 
Our management team believes the following characteristics of our business model will enable us to successfully execute our strategy:
 
Expertise and Name Recognition
 
Our leadership and expertise today are built on the Lindblad family’s decades of experience in expedition adventure travel. Sven-Olof Lindblad, our President and Chief Executive Officer, comes from a rich expedition heritage. The International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators, which was established in 1991, believes that the concept of expedition cruising, coupled with education as a major theme, began when Lars-Eric Lindblad, Sven-Olof Lindblad’s father, led the first traveler’s expedition to Antarctica in 1966. Lars-Eric Lindblad has also been recognized by The New York Times, Travel + Leisure Magazine and other publications for his vision and leadership in developing what is today known as expedition travel. Believing that educated people who saw things with their own eyes would be a potent force for the preservation of the places they visited, Lars-Eric Lindblad worked to promote conservation and restoration projects worldwide. Sven-Olof Lindblad founded Lindblad in 1979, expanding the legacy of his father by providing expanded marine experiences around the world.
 
Under Mr. Lindblad’s leadership, we have led innovation in the expedition adventure travel industry. We pioneered expeditions in the High Arctic and Baja California’s Sea of Cortez and created what we view as the most innovative and in-depth expedition program in Alaska. We initiated the use of kayaks for active exploration in the Polar Regions and in the Galápagos, a feature which is now available on all of our owned vessels to enable personal, water-level encounters with nature. We were also one of the first to develop an undersea exploration program as part of a small ship expedition utilizing state-of-the-art equipment and technology.
 
As a pioneer in the expedition adventure travel sector, we have established deep expertise and knowledge of operating expedition cruises in extreme locations. We have earned awards and honors from various representatives of the travel industry, including recognition for the quality of our offerings and our support for conservation and sustainable tourism. Some of the awards we have earned during 2018 are as follows:
 

● | Cruise Critic Editors' Picks Award: Best for Adventure 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Conde Nast Traveler 2018 Readers Choice Awards: Top Small Ship Cruise Lines 
● | Virtuoso Sustainable Tourism Leadership – Partner 
● | 2018 Travel Weekly Magazine Gold Magellan Award: Best Cruise Line Itinerary for Celebrating The Year Of The Bird In South Georgia & The Falklands
● | Travel + Leisure World’s Best: Top Small Ship Ocean Cruise Lines 
● | Conde Nast Traveler 2018 Gold List: The World's Best Cruises: Antarctica, South Georgia and the Falklands aboard National Geographic Orion

● | 2018 Community Distinctions Awards at the Educational Travel Consortium: Covenant Award 
● | Recommend Magazine 2018 Readers’ Choice Awards: Silver Award for Best Cruise Line in the Luxury Expedition category 

 
When customers select an expedition provider for the types of journeys that we offer, we believe that being known as a trusted brand with extensive operating history and knowledge in the market is a significant competitive strength.

Compelling Expedition Offerings
 
Lindblad is known for delivering voyages that offer in-depth exploration opportunities in locations around the world. Expeditions are operated on intimately-scaled ships with capacities ranging between 28 and 148 guests, fostering a friendly atmosphere on board and extensive interaction between guests, crew and the teams of world-class scientists, naturalists, researchers and photographers that participate in the expeditions. The vessels are nimble and can access locations that are unattainable for large cruise ships, allowing for in-depth exploration itineraries and viewpoints. The ships are customized to provide our signature adventure experiences and activities, such as kayaking among Antarctic icebergs to view penguins or traveling on a Zodiac for an up-close encounter with a whale.
 
We have a longstanding relationship with the National Geographic Society, which was founded on a shared interest in exploration, research, technology and conservation. We collaborate with National Geographic Partners, LLC (“National Geographic”) on expedition planning to enhance the guest experience by having National Geographic experts, including photographers, writers, marine biologists, naturalists, field researchers and film crews, join our expeditions. Guests have the ability to interface with these experts through lectures, excursions, dining and other experiences throughout their expedition.
 
With the addition of Natural Habitat, our expedition offerings have increased to add over 80 different itineraries of adventure travel, land-based, ecotourism in more than 30 countries spanning six continents. Natural Habitat expeditions focus on small groups led by award-winning naturalists to achieve close-up wildlife and nature experiences. Examples of expeditions offered by Natural Habitat include safaris in Botswana, grizzly bear adventures in Alaska and polar bear tours in Canada. Many of Natural Habitat’s expeditions feature access to private wildlife reserves, remote corners of national parks and distinctive lodges and camps for the best wildlife viewing. The smallest expeditions average between eight to nine guests with itineraries running from six to 25 days, with an average of 10 days.
 
We are continuously focused on maintaining and elevating the guest experience and identifying new opportunities to help people discover the wonders of the world. We believe that our track record of high quality expedition offerings, along with our history of providing in-depth and highly innovative itineraries, represent significant competitive advantages for us.
 
Strong Financial Profile
 
Our business model allows us to generate consistent free cash flow with high revenue visibility. Our guests plan and book their expeditions on average nine months in advance, with a deposit due upon booking, providing us insight into future revenue and a source of cash flow. Based on our product offerings, we are able to support premium pricing with minimal discounting and benefit from low capital expenditure requirements, minimal working capital needs and favorable tax attributes.
 
We also have a strong cash position, providing us with ample financial flexibility to pursue growth opportunities through investment in new vessels, new charters, tactical land-based products or potential acquisitions of ships or other operators, while still maintaining a prudent capital structure.
 
Significant Growth Opportunities
 
We believe affluent travelers view their retirement as “a time to travel and explore new places,” favoring travel experiences such as expedition cruising. This has led to strong growth in the specialty cruise segment and we believe these trends will continue. We have expanded the number of ships in our fleet, with the National Geographic Quest in 2017 and the National Geographic Venture in 2018, including additional chartered vessels, and continue to do so. We have a contracted new polar ice class vessel, the National Geographic Endurance, with expected delivery scheduled for the first quarter of 2020, and another recently contracted new polar ice class vessel with anticipated delivery in September 2021. Additionally, we believe that our platform is well positioned to opportunistically seek accretive purchases of operators that lack scale and capital, further extending our growth prospects.
Strategic Alliance with National Geographic
 
We benefit from a longstanding relationship with the National Geographic Society, one of the world’s leading proponents of eco-tourism and natural history. The strategic alliance, which began in 2004, is built on our shared interest in exploration, research, technology and conservation. Founded in 1888, the National Geographic Society is one of the largest non-profit scientific and educational institutions in the world with interests ranging from geography, archaeology and natural science, to the promotion of environmental and historical conservation. Working to inspire, illuminate and teach, National Geographic reaches more than 600 million people a month through a wide range of media, including print, TV and digital. The National Geographic name has significant value for use in connection with travel-related goods and services. The Lindblad/National Geographic alliance includes a co-selling and co-marketing arrangement through which National Geographic promotes our offerings in its marketing campaigns across web-based, email, print and other marketing platforms and sells our expeditions through its internal travel division. The National Geographic sales channel represented approximately 26% of our guest ticket revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 with royalty expense totaling $6.1 million. We believe that the alliance with National Geographic provides us with a substantial competitive advantage in the expedition market based on the brand enhancement, expanded marketing reach and the relationship with National Geographic’s naturalists and photographers.

Through this alliance, we collaborate with National Geographic on exploration, research, technology and conservation in order to provide travel experiences and disseminate geographic knowledge around the globe. The Lindblad/National Geographic alliance is set forth in an Alliance and License Agreement and a Tour Operator Agreement with terms until December 31, 2025 (that may be terminated early by National Geographic in certain instances). In 2018, this alliance was expanded to include all of the Americas.
 
Sven-Olof Lindblad, our founder, previously served on the National Geographic Society’s International Council of Advisors, which was composed of individuals identified by the National Geographic Society as visionary leaders from a range of professions and industries across the globe that exemplify the intellectual curiosity and quest for adventure that has driven the National Geographic Society’s mission since 1888. Mr. John M. Fahey, Jr., one of our directors, previously served as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the National Geographic Society.
 
Partnership with World Wildlife Fund
 
Natural Habitat has partnered with WWF, since 2003, to promote sustainable conservation travel that directly promotes and protects nature. WWF is one of the world’s leading conservation groups with over six million members globally. Natural Habitat’s exclusive license agreement with WWF allows Natural Habitat to use the WWF name and logo through 2023 in return for a royalty fee. 
Industry and Market
 
We believe the specialty and small ship cruising segment of the cruise industry demonstrates the following positive fundamentals:
 
Strong Growth in Specialty and Small Ship Cruising Segment
 
The specialty and small ship cruising segment of the cruise industry is characterized by the smallest vessel size, unique itineraries, active adventures, gourmet culinary programs, highly personalized service and a more inclusive offering. These exclusive attributes, combined with a growing worldwide target population, provide specialty and small ship cruising operators with significant pricing leverage as compared to the other segments of the cruise industry.
 
The specialty cruise segment has demonstrated strong growth as consumers increasingly prefer experiences over other forms of discretionary spending. According to Cruise Lines International Association (“CLIA”), specialty cruises grew by 21% annually from 2009 to 2014. In its 2019 Trend and Industry Outlook, 80% of CLIA-member travel agents expected increased bookings in 2019 from the prior year, with anticipated passenger growth of 6% over 2018. Despite this consistent growth, we believe the specialty cruise industry still has low penetration levels compared to similar land-based vacations, which we believe highlights the continued growth potential for the specialty cruise market.
 
Attractive Target Market Demographics
 
Our offerings appeal to a wide range of travelers, both individuals and families, but affluent individuals in the U.S. aged 50 years or older represent our largest demographic category. We believe that our small ship expedition offerings, with itineraries that promote up-close encounters with wildlife, nature and culture, have significant appeal to this target market. These individuals are also generally near-retirement or retired and have the leisure time and disposable income available to pursue the type of activities that we provide. Based on the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2017 National Projections, the age group of 50 years and older numbered approximately 112 million individuals in 2016, or approximately 35% of the U.S. population, and is expected to grow to approximately 126 million in 2025, an increase of approximately 12%.
High Barriers to Entry
 
The cruise industry in general, and the adventure travel and specialty cruise industries specifically, are characterized by high barriers to entry, which include the expertise and experience required to operate safely and effectively in remote locations, the existence of several well-established and recognizable brands and the time and personal relationships required to develop strong networks of experts to lead and support expeditions. Additionally, there are large investments required to build new, sophisticated ships, long lead times necessary to construct new ships and limited newbuild shipyard capacity. Operators must also develop strong travel agent network partnerships, as well as acquire local permits of licenses required to operate in a diverse range of geographies.

Competition

We compete with a number of cruise lines with competition varying by destination. The market is fragmented and primarily comprised of private operators. The primary competitors that operate in the geographic regions we serve include Silversea Expeditions, Quark Expeditions, Compagnie du Ponant, Hurtigruten and Un-Cruise Adventures. For our land-based expeditions, we compete with a variety of companies offering itineraries in the countries in which we operate. These range from small private operators to larger companies operating across multiple countries. Some of our larger competitors include Abercrombie & Kent, Overseas Adventure Travel and GeoEx. We also compete with other vacation alternatives such as land-based resort hotels and sightseeing destinations for guests’ leisure time.
Business and Growth Strategies
 
The following are the key components of our business strategy:
 
Deliver Exceptional Guest Experiences
 
Our chief governing principle throughout the organization is to ensure that everything adds value to the guest experience. This applies to every step of the process from the first engagement with a potential guest, through the booking process and travel preparations, the actual expedition, whether onboard the vessel or off on explorations, and once back at home.
 
We believe that our guests do not want to be passive tourists, so our expeditions foster active engagement. Our ships are equipped with tools for exploration to get our guests out in the open for up-close forays, or to let guests see deeper into the marine or terrestrial environments surrounding them. It is our goal to provide guests with differentiated opportunities with an experienced expedition team that adds to the guests’ understanding and appreciation, through dedicated observation, insightful commentary and engaging presentations, weaving the expedition into a cohesive narrative. This could include an opportunity for the guest to watch a killer whale circling a seal on an ice floe, while standing next to a marine biologist and an experienced nature photographer from National Geographic. This intense focus on seeking to elevate the overall experience and engaging with guests has resulted in highly favorable customer feedback. We believe that by consistently delivering exceptional experiences to our guests, we have built a highly valuable and trusted brand in the expedition cruising and land-based expedition market, which attracts a growing number of discerning and affluent guests who are prepared to pay a premium for our offerings.
 
High Visibility and Differentiated Revenue Management Strategy
 
Given the nature of our expeditions and the expectation that our guests will seek to plan such trips with substantial notice, we begin to market our voyages approximately 12 to 24 months in advance of the departure date, depending on the destination. Guests book their trips, on average, nine months prior to sail date, paying a deposit at booking and the final payment 60 to 120 days within the date of travel, dependent upon the selected voyage. As of February 26, 2019, 87% of the Lindblad segment’s expected guest ticket revenues for 2019 has been booked. 
 
Unlike the large cruise line operators that serve the broader market, our product offering is inclusive of most costs and therefore the advance customer payments provide us strong visibility into future revenues and the associated cash flows. By having such visibility into future business, we can more effectively manage any additional sales and marketing efforts that may be required to ensure that the programs reach their targeted occupancy levels. We do not believe in driving participation through discounting and do not generally pursue such strategies. Instead, we focus on voyage enhancements that add significant value to the product without significant incremental cost, as well as targeted marketing efforts in order to strengthen occupancy rates, if required. Based on our offerings, the targeted audience and premium pricing, our guests are generally older, more affluent and do not travel with three or four individuals in one cabin. As it is industry convention to base 100% occupancy on two persons per cabin, we may report occupancy levels that are somewhat lower than the large cruise lines serving the broader market. However, we have achieved strong occupancy rates for the Lindblad segment in the last three years (based on two persons per cabin), operating at 91%, 87% and 90% occupancy rate for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
Maximize and Grow Net Yields
 
We have historically achieved high net yields and continue to see opportunities for growth. Net yield is a frequently referenced metric in the cruise industry and refers to tour revenues net of commissions and certain direct costs in a specific period divided by the number of available guest nights. Our net yields are driven by our offerings, premium pricing and ancillary guest revenue, such as pre- or post-voyage trip extensions, add-on optional activities, trip insurance and onboard spend, including spa services and alcoholic beverages. Our net yields were $1,044, $985 and $976 in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Furthermore, our historical net yield has been significantly higher than the large scale cruise line operators. We expect to be able to continue our track record of maintaining strong pricing and growing ancillary guest revenues through increased sales focus and marketing efforts.

Elevate Brand Awareness and Loyalty
 
Our brand is recognizable by our guests primarily due to our heritage, decades of sales and marketing investment and longstanding strategic alliance with National Geographic. We believe we have fostered strong guest and brand loyalty, which is evidenced by our high levels of repeat guests. In 2018, 37% of guests booked through our U.S. office were past guests. We have closely aligned our marketing efforts with National Geographic to maximize impact in the marketplace and have engaged in a co-branding strategy with respect to our owned vessels. In addition, we are recognized as a leader in promoting the issue of conservation of the planet and encourage our guests to become engaged through the Lindblad Expeditions – National Geographic Joint Fund for Exploration and Conservation (“LEX-NG Fund”). In the past, we have organized high-level meetings in the Arctic, Antarctic, Galápagos and Baja California to put a spotlight on key environmental issues in conjunction with organizations such as the Aspen Institute, TED and the WWF. These efforts help to build our brand and network of relationships and enhance our thought leadership. We will continue to focus on ensuring that each of our guests associates our brand with high-quality marine based adventure vacation experiences.
 
We source our business through a combination of direct selling, travel agency networks and our strategic alliance with National Geographic. We invest in maintaining strong relationships with our key travel agency network partners and seek to maintain commission rates and incentive structures that are competitive within the marketplace.
 
We maintain an active presence on numerous social media platforms, focusing primarily on those with the greatest reach to our target demographic. In addition, we routinely feed content to National Geographic’s social media platforms, which extend the reach of our brand significantly.
 
Disciplined Expansion
 
We are focused on growing our business in a prudent and disciplined manner. When evaluating various strategies for expansion of guest capacity, we consider closely the expected return on invested capital and the range of possibilities, such as a newbuild program, adding selected charters and the acquisitions of existing ships or operators. In 2016, we acquired an 80.1% ownership in Natural Habitat. We launched two new coastal vessels, the National Geographic Quest in 2017 and the National Geographic Venture in the fourth quarter of 2018. Additionally, we currently have a polar ice class vessel, the National Geographic Endurance, under construction and scheduled for delivery in early 2020, and in February 2019 we entered into an agreement to construct a second polar ice class vessel, a sister ship of the National Geographic Endurance, with anticipated delivery in September 2021. We believe that we have ample capital and financial flexibility to fund investments in vessel acquisition and management considers it to be an important step to meet increasing demand for our offerings.
Operations
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We place a strong emphasis on identifying the needs of our guests and creating expedition opportunities and products that guests value. We use communication strategies and marketing campaigns designed to strengthen brand awareness and to emphasize the distinctive qualities of each expedition we offer. Marketing strategies include the use of direct mail, traditional media, social media, brand websites and travel agencies.
 
We source our business through a combination of direct selling, travel agency networks and our strategic alliance with National Geographic. We invest in maintaining strong relationships with our key travel agency network partners and seek to maintain commission rates and incentive structures that are competitive within the marketplace.
 
Historically, our focus has been to primarily source guests for our expeditions from the United States. Expedition cruise guests sourced from the U.S. represented approximately 90% of our total global expedition cruise guests’ ticket revenue in 2018 and 2017, and 89% in 2016.
 
Our largest channel for guest bookings is direct contact, either by guests calling and speaking with our expedition specialists, or requesting a reservation online at our website. The direct channel represented nearly 40%, 41% and 39% of guest ticket revenues for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
We also generate significant bookings from travel agents and wholesalers, representing approximately 28% for the year ended 2018 and 27% for the years ended 2017 and 2016. Agent outreach efforts are focused primarily on consortiums, or travel agent networks, which target affluent travelers. The four consortiums with which we have preferred partner agreements are Virtuoso, Signature, American Express and Ensemble. Preferred status provides their agents with financial incentives to book their customers on our expeditions and provides us the opportunity for enhanced marketing to their agents and end-user customers. Our agent and affinity sales team meet with hundreds of highly-targeted agents annually, at consortium conferences and training seminars, and in-person at agency offices to provide hands-on training, support and product knowledge.

The National Geographic relationship also serves as a channel for bookings. Our alliance with National Geographic includes a co-selling and co-marketing arrangement through which National Geographic promotes our offerings in its marketing campaigns across web-based, email, print and other marketing platforms and sells our expeditions through its internal travel division. The National Geographic channel represented approximately 26%, 25% and 27% of guest ticket revenues for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As part of this relationship, our owned vessels carry the National Geographic name.
 
The remainder of our bookings, 6% of guest ticket revenues for 2018 and 2017 and 7% for 2016, respectively, comes from affinity groups and charters. Affinity groups are predominantly college and university alumni associations, and other travel organizations targeting specific market niches.
 
We have a broad and diverse marketing mix across multiple media platforms and channels, allowing us to effectively communicate our product offerings to past guests and prospective guests. We continually optimize our media mix to reach our target demographic. The majority of our annual global marketing spend is focused on consumer-direct channels, with direct mail being the largest segment of our marketing expenditures. Our detailed brochures present our expedition offerings comprehensively, providing guests with all the information needed to make an informed travel decision. We also execute direct mail campaigns with the primary purpose of generating qualified leads, upon which we will fulfill requests with the appropriate product brochure and/or digital media. We also promote our expeditions across a variety of print media, primarily magazines targeting affluent travelers, as well as nature and photography enthusiasts.
 
Our website, www.expeditions.com, is supported internally by a dynamic content management system, allowing frequent updates, a visually-impactful design, large photos and video display with simple, straightforward navigation. We also send weekly mobile-optimized emails to our database of opt-in email subscribers, which link back to key areas on expeditions.com. In addition, we routinely offer webinars to offer greater insights into our expeditions, hosted by members of the expedition teams with intimate knowledge of the geographies featured.
 
We maintain an active presence on numerous social media platforms, focusing primarily on those with the greatest reach to our target demographic. In addition, we routinely feed content to National Geographic’s social media platforms, which extend the reach of our brand significantly.
 
Our marketing team encompasses broad and diverse skill sets including product and channel marketing, digital marketing, database marketing, copywriting and creative, video production and research and analytics.
 
 Expedition Cruise Pricing


Our voyage prices typically include accommodations and all expedition activities and meals, other than items of a personal nature, such as airfare to and from an expedition, spa treatments and certain other specialized events or activities. Prices vary depending on many factors, including the vessel, the destinations on a particular voyage, number of guest berths available, expedition length, cabin category selected and time of year during which the expedition takes place. Payment terms generally require an upfront deposit to confirm a reservation with the balance due prior to departure.
 
We focus on maintaining list pricing of our offerings and any discounting that we pursue is tactical, targeted and infrequent. In addition to our standard expedition packages, we may be able to offer a complete vessel for charter and may provide incentives for this type of arrangement. Group and multi-generational family travel may also be eligible for additional incentives based upon the voyage, duration and number of guests travelling. From time to time, we may incentivize guests to book with us with a variety of offers, including free or reduced price air transportation, hotel nights or other value-added items. We offer rewards to our guests through our loyalty program, Friends for Life, to encourage repeat business.
 
Lindblad Expeditions – National Geographic Joint Fund for Exploration and Conservation (LEX-NG Fund)
 
We seek to inspire people to explore and care about the planet. One of our governing principles is to positively impact the areas we explore and in which we work. To this end, we, along with the National Geographic Society, created the LEX-NG Fund to support projects at the global, regional and local level. The objective of the LEX-NG Fund is to support projects that address the health and viability of our world's oceans, coastlines and coastal communities in the regions visited by our fleet, and beyond. Together with our guests, we have raised $10.7 million since the Fund was established in 2008. In addition, 500,000 shares of Lindblad common stock were contributed to the LEX-NG Fund by the founders of Capitol Acquisition Corp. II in connection with the merger with Lindblad Expeditions, Inc., to support the regions that we visit. Since we and the National Geographic Society together cover the LEX-NG Fund’s operating costs, 100% of guest contributions go directly to on-the-ground projects. In 2018, the LEX-NG Fund issued 10 unique grants to regional partners in five key regions, while also supporting three major National Geographic Society conservation, education and research initiatives: Pristine Seas, Grosvenor Teacher Fellows and Early Career Grants. All of these activities were supported with an aggregate amount of $1.5 million. The majority of funds were donated by guests traveling aboard our fleet. The LEX-NG Fund is managed jointly by one of our staff members and two National Geographic Society staff members, and the Board is currently comprised of five members, including Sven-Olof Lindblad, our founder, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Dr. Jonathan Baillie, Chief Scientist and Senior Vice President, Science & Exploration at the National Geographic Society.

Environmental Stewardship
 
Our staff is involved in organizations such as the International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators and the Association of Arctic Expedition Cruise Operators, which seek to lead the tourism industry with management best practices for visiting places such as Antarctica, the Arctic and the Galápagos Islands. Our staff also works with the MarViva Foundation (a non-governmental organization focused on promoting the conservation and sustainable use of coastal and marine ecosystems in the eastern tropical Pacific) to provide a consumer market for sustainably caught fish from the first designated responsible fishing area of Costa Rica. We also work with the Charles Darwin Research Station and Charles Darwin Foundation on conservation initiatives geared toward preserving the Galápagos Islands. In 2018, we announced the elimination of single-use plastics fleet-wide.
Seasonality
 
Our tour revenues from the sale of guest tickets are mildly seasonal, historically larger in the first and third quarters. The seasonality of our operating results fluctuates due to our vessels being taken out of service for scheduled maintenance or drydocking, which is typically during nonpeak demand periods, in the second and fourth quarters. Our drydock schedules are subject to cost and timing differences from year to year due to the availability of shipyards for certain work, drydock locations based on ship itineraries, operating conditions experienced especially in the polar regions and the applicable regulations of class societies in the maritime industry, which require more extensive reviews periodically. Drydocking impacts operating results by reducing tour revenues and increasing cost of tours. Natural Habitat is a seasonal business, with the majority of its tour revenue recorded in the third and fourth quarters from its summer season departures and polar bear tours.
Suppliers
 
Our largest capital expenditures are for ship acquisition and capital improvements. Our largest operating expenditures are for ship maintenance, payroll, fuel, food and beverage, travel agent services and advertising and marketing. Most of the supplies that we require are available from numerous sources at competitive prices.
Insurance
 
We maintain comprehensive insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates and believe that our current coverage is at appropriate levels to protect against most of the risk involved in the conduct of our business.
 
We maintain insurance on the hull and machinery of each of our ships that includes additional coverage for disbursements, earnings and increased value. We also maintain protection and indemnity insurance for each of our owned ships. In addition, we maintain war risk insurance on each ship, which covers damage due to acts of war, including invasion, insurrection, terrorism, rebellion, piracy and hijacking. This coverage includes coverage for physical damage to the ship, which is not covered under the hull policies as a result of war exclusion clauses in such hull policies. We also maintain protection and indemnity war risk coverage. Consistent with most marine war risk policies, under the terms of the war risk insurance coverage, underwriters can give notice that the policy will be canceled and reinstated at higher premium rates. We also maintain insurance coverage for shoreside property, shipboard inventory and marine and non-marine general liability risks, as well as business interruption insurance for our owned ships based on the evaluation of the financial exposure per vessel for profitability. In addition, we maintain workers compensation, directors’ and officers’ liability and other insurance coverage.
 
We historically have been able to obtain insurance coverage in amounts and at premiums we have deemed to be commercially acceptable. No assurance can be given that affordable and secure insurance markets will be available in the future, particularly for war risk insurance. All of our insurance coverage is subject to certain limitations, exclusions and deductible levels.
  
Regulation
 
Our ships are regulated by various international, national, state and local laws, regulations and treaties in force in the jurisdictions in which they operate. In addition, certain ships are registered in the U.S., the Bahamas or Ecuador, as applicable. Each ship is subject to regulations issued by its country of registry, including regulations issued pursuant to international treaties governing the safety of the ships, guests and crew as well as environmental protection. Each country of registry conducts periodic inspections to verify compliance with these regulations. Ships operating out of U.S. ports are subject to inspection by the U.S. Coast Guard for compliance with international treaties and by the United States Public Health Service for sanitary and health conditions. Ships are also subject to similar inspections pursuant to the laws and regulations of various other countries visited. Health, safety, security, environmental and financial responsibility issues are, and will continue to be, an area of focus by the relevant government authorities in the U.S. and internationally. From time to time, various regulatory and legislative changes may be proposed that could impact operations and subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future.

Safety and Security Regulations
 
Our ships are required to comply with international safety standards defined in SOLAS, which, among other things, establishes requirements for ship design, structural features, materials, construction, life-saving equipment and safe management, and operation of ships to ensure guest and crew safety. The SOLAS standards are revised from time to time and the most recent modifications were phased in through 2010. SOLAS incorporates the International Safety Management Code (“ISM Code”), which provides an international standard for the safe management and operation of ships and for pollution prevention. The ISM Code is mandatory for all vessels, including passenger vessel operators. All of our operations and ships are regularly audited by various national authorities and maintain the required certificates of compliance with the ISM Code.
 
Our ships are also subject to various security requirements, including the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (“ISPS Code”), which is part of SOLAS, and the U.S. Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (“MTSA”), which applies to ships that operate in U.S. ports. In order to satisfy these security requirements, we implement security measures, conduct vessel security assessments and develop security plans. The security plans for all of the ships have been submitted to, and approved by, the respective countries of registry for compliance with the ISPS Code and the MTSA.
 
Environmental Regulations
 
We are subject to various U.S. and international laws and regulations relating to environmental protection. Under such laws and regulations, we are prohibited from, among other things, discharging certain materials, such as petrochemicals and plastics, into the waterways. From time to time, environmental and other regulators may consider more stringent regulations, which may affect our operations and increase compliance costs.
 
The ships are subject to the International Maritime Organization’s regulations under the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (the “MARPOL Regulations”), which includes requirements designed to minimize pollution by oil, sewage, garbage and air emissions. We have obtained the relevant international compliance certificates relating to oil, sewage and air pollution prevention for all of our ships.
 
The MARPOL Regulations impose global limitations on the sulfur content of fuel used by ships operating worldwide and also establish special Emission Control Areas (“ECAs”) with stringent limitations on sulfur and nitrogen oxide emissions in these areas. As of February 2014, there were four established ECAs: the Baltic Sea, the North Sea/English Channel, certain of the waters surrounding the North American coast, and the waters surrounding Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Currently, ships operating in ECAs are required to operate on fuel with a sulfur content of not more than 0.1% m/m (mass by mass). Ships operating elsewhere are subject to a limit of 3.5%, which is expected to be reduced to not more than 0.5% m/m on and after January 1, 2020 (or January 1, 2025 if the International Maritime Organization elects to defer the new cap of sulfur content following a review of the availability of low sulfur fuel for use by ships).
 
In July 2011, MARPOL Regulations introduced mandatory measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These include the utilization of an energy efficiency design index (“EEDI”) for new ships as well as the establishment of an energy efficient management plan for all ships. The EEDI is a performance-based mechanism that requires a certain minimum energy efficiency in new ships. These regulations apply to new vessels commissioned after January 1, 2013. In June 2013, the European Commission proposed legislation which would require cruise ship operators using ports in the European Union to monitor and report on the vessels’ annual carbon dioxide emissions starting in 2018.
 
The Coastwise Laws

As U.S. flag vessels, the National Geographic Sea Bird, the National Geographic Sea Lion, the National Geographic Quest and the National Geographic Venture, are subject to the U.S. laws relating to the transport of passengers or cargo between U.S. ports in the U.S. coastwise trade.
 
These laws relating to vessels are principally contained in 46 U.S.C. §55103 and the federal regulations promulgated thereunder and are commonly referred to collectively as the “Coastwise Laws.” Subject to limited exceptions, vessels transporting passengers between ports of places in the United States, whether directly or by the way of foreign port, must be "coastwise qualified". To be qualified, a vessel must be owned and operated by “citizens of the United States” within the meaning of the governing laws and regulations. In the case of a corporation to be deemed a U.S. citizen: (i) the corporation must be organized under the laws of the U.S. or of a state, territory or possession thereof; (ii) each of the chief executive officer and the chairman of the board of directors of such corporation, and each person authorized to act in the absence or disability of such persons, must be a U.S. citizen; (iii) no more than a minority of the number of directors of such corporation necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business can be non-U.S. citizens; and (iv) at least 75% of each class or series of stock in such corporation must be beneficially owned by U.S. citizens.
 
 13


Labor Regulations
 
The International Labour Organization, an agency of the United Nations that develops worldwide employment standards, adopted a Consolidated Maritime Labour Convention (the “Convention”) in 2006, which became effective in August 2013. The Convention reflects a broad range of standards and conditions governing all aspects of crew management for ships in international commerce, including additional requirements not previously in effect relating to the health, safety, repatriation, entitlements and status of crewmembers and crew recruitment practices. Each of our ships, except for our two ships operating in Ecuador (not a signatory to the Convention), has received its certification of compliance with the requirements of the Convention.
Consumer Financial Responsibility Regulations
 
U.S. law requires the operators of passenger vessels embarking passengers at U.S. ports to be certified by the United States Federal Maritime Commission as to their ability to satisfy obligations with respect to unearned passenger revenue in case of non-performance, and for liability in case of casualty or personal injury. We satisfy these requirements with respect to our operation of the National Geographic Sea Bird, National Geographic Sea Lion, National Geographic Quest, National Geographic Venture and the U.S. embarking expeditions of the National Geographic Orion through an escrow account for passenger deposits and through our liability insurers.
 
Certain jurisdictions require that we establish financial responsibility to our guests resulting from the non-performance of our obligations; however, the related amounts do not have a material effect on our costs.
 
Regulations Regarding Protection of Disabled Persons
 
Our U.S. flag vessels, the National Geographic Sea Bird, National Geographic Sea Lion, National Geographic Quest and the National Geographic Venture are subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which creates affirmative requirements intended to facilitate access by disabled persons. The ADA requires that our U.S. flagged vessels make “reasonable accommodation” in their policies, practices and procedures to facilitate the carriage of passengers with disabilities.
 
In June 2013, the U.S. Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board proposed guidelines for the construction and alteration of passenger vessels to ensure that the vessels are readily accessible to and usable by passengers with disabilities. If and when finalized, these guidelines will be used by the U.S. Department of Transportation and U.S. Department of Justice to implement mandatory and enforceable standards for passenger vessels covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act. We cannot, at this time, accurately predict whether we will be required to make material modifications or incur significant additional expenses given the status of the proposed guidelines.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 600 employees, including 327 shipboard employees, 266 full-time employees and seven part-time employees in our shoreside operations.
