Thumzup® Products and Services
 
The Company operates in a single business segment which is social media marketing. The Thumzup® App works on both iPhone and Android mobile operating systems and connects brands and people who use and love these brands. For the Advertiser, Thumzup® incentivizes real people to become content Creators and post authentic valuable posts on social media about the Advertiser and its products.
 
The Company seeks to capitalize on industry-wide gig economy and business democratization trends. Immense value and opportunity have been created through the democratization of ride sharing, hospitality, finance and other industries. The Thumzup® tools are designed to facilitate this democratization trend for the consumer and the Advertiser within the online advertising space.
 
The Company has built the technology to support an influencer and “gig” economy community around its Thumzup® App. This technology and community are designed to generate scalable authentic product posts and recommendations for Advertisers on social media. It is designed to connect Advertisers with individuals who are willing to tell their friends about the Advertisers’ products online and offline.
 
Social Media Marketing Software Technology
 
The Thumzup® mobile App enables Creators, to select from brands advertising on the App and get paid to post about the Advertiser on social media. Once the Thumzup® Creator selects the brand and takes a photo using the Thumzup® App, the Thumzup® App posts the photo and a caption to the Creator’s social media accounts. The Advertiser then reviews and approves the post for payment and the Creator can cash out whenever they choose through popular digital payment systems. For the Advertiser, the Thumzup® system enables brands to get real people to promote their products to their friends, rather than displaying banner ads that people are tuning out.
 
A recent Nielsen report found more than 80% of consumers believe friends and family are the most reliable sources of information about products. According to a Pixlee article, 64% of millennials recommend a product at least once a month, and according to a 2019 Morning Consult survey, 86% of Gen Z and millennials would post content for monetary compensation.
 
The average American adult is expected to spend 8 hours and 11 minutes per day using digital media in 2022 according to Insider Intelligence. The amount of daily usage has increased significantly over the past several years, again according to Insider Intelligence, and the Company believes such usage will continue to accelerate. The Company empowers businesses that want to interact with these Creators and provides tools and data so they can increase consumer awareness and expand their customer bases.

In the past decade, social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and TikTok have achieved mass worldwide consumer acceptance and created hundreds of billions of dollars in shareholder value. This worldwide viral growth demonstrates that compelling new social media platforms which present the right combination of experience and value, will attract Creators who will invest significant amounts of time on the platforms.
 
The Company is an early-stage entity building a new real-time platform to support the gig economy. The Company believes that acceptance of its App and revenue growth can be driven by empowering everyday people to make money by posting about what they find to be enjoyable or attractive on social media. The Company believes that the Thumzup® App is a conduit for Advertisers to connect directly with consumers. The Company will need to secure enough Advertisers to make the App an attractive platform for adoption and scalability, and to ensure that the platform is interesting enough for the Creators to return to on a regular basis. No assurance can be given that the Company will be able to achieve these results.
 
The Industry—Online Advertising
 
The Company believes that it is developing a new form of social media marketing that does not currently exist, therefore existing descriptions of market size and penetration are not directly applicable. As Thumzup® matures, the Company believes there will be other competitors in this new market of paying non-professional advocates to tell their friends about products they love on social media at the point-of-sale. The closest existing market that is similar to Thumzup’s market is the rapidly growing subset of online advertising called “influencer marketing.” As social media influencers become more plentiful and proven, advertising spending has increased in this space. Brands are estimated to spend up to $4.62 billion on influencer marketing in 2023 according to a 2021 Insider Intelligence forecast[7]. We believe major brands recognize that having their happy customers post on social media is valuable.
 
Most existing paid influencer marketing platforms were designed for professional and semi-professional online personalities. Some of these platforms have expanded to accommodate “micro-influencers” – people with 5,000 to 30,000 social media followers. In the Company’s opinion, none of these influencer platforms has entered the public consciousness and found mass adoption.
 
Recent research conducted by TapInfluence has found that influencer marketing content delivers 11 times higher return on investment than traditional forms of digital marketing, and approximately 66% of marketing firms now deploy influencer marketing according to a 2018 Association of National Advertisers survey. A recent Nielsen report found more than 80% of consumers believe friends and family are the most reliable sources of information about products. According to Simplilearn, nano-influencers have an average engagement rate of 8%, more than 4 times that of accounts with more than 1,000,000 followers and further, as an account’s audience grows, its engagement rate tends to decrease. There thus appears to be, in the Company’s view, a clear downward correlation between follower sizes and post likes. Around 66% of marketers now use influencers and nearly half of U.S. marketers plan to increase their influencer budgets according to a according to a 2018 Association of National Advertisers survey. According to a Pixlee article, 64% of millennials recommend a product at least once a month, and according to a 2019 Morning Consult survey, 86% of Gen Z and millennials would post content for monetary compensation.
 
The Company has designed Thumzup® “from the ground up” to make it easy for brands and service providers to activate people who are not professional influencers but who are passionate about the products, services, or establishments they enjoy or frequent and then are willing to relate those experiences to their friends and other social media followers. The Company has designed the Thumzup App and Advertiser dashboard with Apple-style simplicity and intuitive features to make participation by all individuals seamless with their existing use of social media.

The Company’s first product—Thumzup® App
 
The Company operates in a single business segment, which is social media marketing. The Company’s mobile iPhone and Android applications called “Thumzup®” connects brands, products, and services to the people who use and love these brands, products, and services. For Advertisers, Thumzup® activates real people to post real product reviews and testimonials on social media with the intention of enhancing brand awareness and reaching targeted consumers more directly and effectively while driving profitable traffic to the Advertisers’ products and services.
 
The Company is building an influencer and gig economy community around the Thumzup® mobile App that will generate scalable authentic product posts and recommendations for Advertisers on social media and create a technology platform making person-to-person advertising easy, cost-effective, and scalable. The App and Advertiser dashboard are designed to connect Advertisers with individuals who are willing to promote their products and services online and offline.
 
Social Media Marketing Software Technology
 
The Company’s Services
 
The Thumzup® mobile App enables Creators to select from brands advertising on the App and get paid to post about the Advertiser on social media. Once the Thumzup® Creator selects the brand and takes a photo using the Thumzup® App, the Thumzup® App posts the photo and a caption to the Creator’s social media accounts. The Advertiser then reviews and approves the post for payment and the Creator can cash out whenever they choose through popular digital payment systems. For the Advertiser, the Thumzup® system enables brands to get real people to promote their products and services to their friends, rather than displaying banner ads that social media users are tuning out.
 
With the Thumzup® App, the Company is targeting and seeking to sign up everyday people and gig economy workers who like specific brands and present them with opportunities to be paid for posting about the brands on social media. The Company believes that its management team has the sales relationships, legal, and technology expertise for its current level of development. The Company will need to add additional staff to rapidly grow the business. All source code, development work, and intellectual property performed under independent development or employment contracts paid for by the Company are assigned to and owned by Thumzup®.
 
Intellectual Property
 
The Company owns the copyrights to the source code for the Thumzup® App on the iPhone iOS and Android operating mobile operating systems as used on the majority of mobile phone and tablet devices. The Company also owns the copyrighted source code for the “backend” system that administrates the Thumzup® App, tracks payments and advertising campaigns.
 
The Thumzup® thumb logo is a registered trademark owned by Thumzup® Media Corporation, Reg. No. 6,842,424, registered Sep. 13, 2022. On April 13, 2021, the Company filed a trademark application ser. No. 90642789 with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) for the word mark THUMZUP, which was granted registration on June 21, 2022, resulting in reg. no. 6764158. Also on April 13, 2021, the Company filed a trademark application ser. No. 90642848 for the Thumzup® logo, featuring a stylized hand with an upwardly extended thumb. Meta Platforms, Inc. (which owns and operates Facebook and Instagram) initially filed opposition to the logo on June 30, 2022. Thumzup® agreed to not use the logo as a reaction to a post and Meta Platforms, Inc. subsequently withdrew their opposition on August 5, 2022 and it was dismissed without prejudice.

Business Model
 
Advertisers purchase a campaign on the Thumzup® website. Once the Advertiser approves a post for payment, the platform facilitates the payment to Creators a monetary amount per screened post which may range from $1.00 to $1,000.00. The Thumzup® platform enables the Advertiser to screen posts so that the Advertiser only pays for posts that are commercially valuable and rewards Creators for posts that have images and text that represent the Advertiser in a positive manner.
 
Per Post Fee. Thumzup® Advertisers are charged a “Per Post Fee.” By way of illustration, an Advertiser that buys 100,000 posts from Thumzup®, to pay out $10 per post to Thumzup® Creators, would purchase the posts for $13.00 each or $1,300,000. The Creators in this illustration would receive a total of $1,000,000 and Thumzup® would retain $300,000 for its services. The Thumzup® platform would facilitate 100,000 posts for the Advertiser from Thumzup® Creators sharing with their friends about their endorsed products on social media.
 
Value Proposition
 
The Thumzup® App is designed to generate scalable social media authentic social media content for Advertisers. It is designed to connect Advertisers with individuals who are willing to authentically promote their products online. The Company envisions that many gig economy workers will be ideal candidates to become Creators posting on Thumzup®. Imagine a gig economy driver waiting for their next fare who takes a moment to post about the good experience they had at their lunch spot where they are waiting. Imagine a gig economy worker on a laptop at a coffee shop doing a graphic design project from a gig economy site who takes a moment to post about the coffee shop where they are working on Thumzup®. The Company believes that Thumzup® can readily provide extra income for this existing pool of gig economy workers. The Company believes these gig economy workers will be able to provide quality Thumzup® posts on social media for which Advertisers will be willing to pay.
Regulatory Compliance
 
The Federal Trade Commission regulates and requires certain disclosures by social media influencers, specifying when disclosure is required, and how the disclosure should be presented. These rules are codified in the Code of Federal Regulations, 16 CFR Part 255. Specifically, the FTC requires that influencers disclose any financial, employment, personal, or family relationship with a brand. Influencers must disclose financial relationships and consideration paid including any money, discounted products or other benefits paid to the influencer. Creators on the Thumzup platform are being paid to post about Thumzup advertisers. Thumzup puts #ad in each post made on its platform to disclose that the creator has been paid to make the post.
 
The Company does not believe its compliance with existing FTC regulations will have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position of the Company and its subsidiaries, for the current fiscal year and any other material future period.

Thumzup™ App Workflow
 

For direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) brands, a customer might get a postcard in the box upon receiving a purchase in the mail. A postcard would inform the customer about the opportunity to get cashback by sharing a picture of the purchase with friends on social media. If the Creator takes a picture of the postcard, a link to download the Thumzup® App will appear on the customer’s phone. The illustration to the left and those below are intended as examples only and will not necessarily correlate to a final version or an amount. Actual wording and amounts will depend on agreements with Advertisers, products or brands seeking recommendations and other market factors as may be assessed by management. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


For physical stores and restaurants, the Company offers signage to make patrons aware that they can be paid to tell their friends about their positive experience in the store or restaurant. When Creators open the Thumzup® App on their phones, they will reach a welcome screen which establishes the idea that they can get paid to post about brands, services and places they like with the App. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The main screen appears after a Creator enters the unique code the Company sent. The main screen enables each Creator to easily select brands, nearby restaurants, and stores that will pay the Thumzup Creator to post to friends and other followers about products and places recommended by the Creator on social media. The main screen has seven main areas where the Creator can take action. There is a “hamburger” menu in the upper left to access administrative functions and there is a balance due to the Creator displayed on the upper right. Next, going down the screen there is a search bar, a map tool, a left to the right slider to select brands that will pay for posts, and an up and down slider to select locations nearby that will pay to post. The “hamburger” menu in the upper left gives the Creator access to change bank or payment information, to link to social media, and to invite friends. The balance due to the Creator number in the upper right has the total of monies pending and monies due but not yet transferred to the Creator. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When Creators select a brand or location tile from the main menu, the App enables them to take pictures of their enjoying the product or experience. The App then enables them to customize the caption that will be posted to social media. Once Creators submit the pictures and captions, they get uploaded and displayed on the social media account of those Creators. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thumzup® inserts the tag required to disclose that the post is a paid promotion. If the Advertiser, in this case at left, a fictional brand called “Wearclick” has chosen to offer a discount code to the Thumzup Creator’s friends on social media, that discount code gets embedded in the post along with the offer. When the Creator makes a new post, the post is reviewed by Thumzup on behalf of the Advertiser to assure that it meets community standards, does not include sexually explicit images or text, and that the post reflects the Advertiser in a commercially favorable light. For instance, if images are poorly lit or irrelevant to the brand, Creators may be sent text messages to the Creators giving them this feedback and explaining that the post is not due for payment. When Creators want to receive the money they have earned they tap on the PayMe! selection on the App menu. The App then pays the Creator via online payment systems, such as Venmo or PayPal, the amount due from all screened posts made by that Creator. The App enables the Creator to search for brands they like that will pay them to post. This is useful so that Thumzup® Creators can easily discover brands they like to post about. The App pays Creators to post about brands.

In the Company’s opinion, paid posts from happy customers about how much they like an Advertiser’s goods or services offer attractive, compelling values to both Advertisers and Creators compared to traditional online advertising because those posts should yield higher response rates. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Thumzup® system provides Advertisers with quality control by enabling the Advertiser to review posts to make sure that the posts meet community standards and are commercially useful to the Advertiser. This helps reduce the number of people who may try to game the system to otherwise not use it properly. Thumzup® Creators can opt-in to receive text message from brands. This opt-in opportunity is valuable to Advertiser brands because text messages have higher visibility to potential customers than emails.
 
The Thumzup® system enables “campaign spend” to be limited by a total dollar amount as determined by the Advertiser. Once the posts that the Advertiser has paid for have been posted and approved for payment, the campaign expires and the Advertiser incurs no additional cost until it chooses to increase the amount. It also enables the Advertiser to limit the number of posts made by an individual Creator by day, week, and month. The Company believes that this feature enables more efficient budgetary control while reducing unintended cost overruns. This feature may eliminate abuse or saturation by Creators who post more than what may be commercially valuable to Advertisers.

Financing Plan
 
In November 2020, the Company raised an aggregate of $215,000 through issuance of senior secured convertible promissory notes to four holders, which have since been converted and exchanged 
into shares of Common and Preferred Stock, respectively, and are now retired. From January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2022, the Company has raised an additional $1,880,412 and $1,260,000 through the sale of its Common and Preferred Stock, respectively, to Accredited Investors in private placements pursuant to section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. These funds have been used to build and beta test the Thumzup® App and to cover operating costs, including other administrative costs and expenses.
 
During the year 2021 the Company was pre-revenue and transitioned into beta testing. The Company has generated minimal revenue in 2022 from a limited soft launch in Santa Monica and Venice, CA. The Thumzup® App commercial launch began in late 2022 in a geographic region around the West Side of Los Angeles with expansion into other geographic regions planned for 2023 and beyond.
 
The Company is currently conducting an offering under Regulation A+, pursuant to an Offering Statement on Form 1-A/A filed on December 23, 2022 and qualified on January 9, 2023, through which the Company is offering up to 2 million shares of common stock at a purchase price of $4.50 per share. The Company currently has subscriptions for 64,894 shares for an aggregate subscription amount of $292,023 in escrow as fully described in the Company’s Form 1-A/A filed on December 23, 2022.
 
Competition
 
The Company has competitors in influencer marketing software companies as GRIN, #paid, CreatorIQ, Mavrck, Popular Pays, Tribe Dynamics, AspireIQ, Influenster, Traackr, and Hivency. All of the above-named competitor influencer marketing software is focused on influencers who see themselves as professional influencers. To the best of the Company’s knowledge, these competitors are not building platforms designed to turn social media creators into micro-influencers in the manner that the Company seeks to accomplish. Rep is also an app that connects brands with influencers who are interesting in promoting brands. Rep’s app is different from Thumzup® because it is targeting people who consider themselves influencers.
 
The Company does not currently know of another business that is seeking to build a community of everyday people and empowering them to post about brands that they love.
 
Nevertheless, the influencer marketing industry segments are rapidly evolving and competitive and the Company expects competition to intensify in the future with the emergence of new technologies and market entrants. The Company’s competitors may enjoy competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, substantially greater market share, established marketing relationships with, and access to, large existing advertisers and user bases, and substantially greater financial, technical and other resources. These competitors may use these advantages to offer apps or other products similar to the Company’s at a lower price, develop different products to compete with the Company’s current solutions and respond more quickly and effectively than the Company does to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or client requirements particularly across different cities and geographical regions. Certain competitors could also use strong or dominant positions in one or more markets to gain competitive advantage against the Company in markets in which it operates in the future. The Company believes its ability to compete successfully for users, content, and advertising and other customers depends upon many factors both within and beyond the Company’s control, including:
 

● | the popularity, usefulness, ease of use, performance and reliability of the Thumzup® App and services compared to those of competitors; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the ability, in and of itself as well as in comparison to the ability of competitors, to develop new apps, other products and services and enhancements to then existing apps, products and services;

● | the Company’s ad targeting and measurement capabilities, and those of its competitors; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the size, composition and level of engagement of the Thumzup® App user communities relative to those of the Company’s competitors; 
● | the Company’s marketing and selling efforts, and those of its competitors; 
● | the pricing of the Thumzup® Apps and services relative to those of its competitors; 
● | the actual or perceived return the Company’s customers receive from the deployment of the Thumzup® Apps within the user communities relative to returns from the Company’s competitors; and 
● | the Company’s reputation and brand strength relative to its competitors. 

 
Problems in the market that Thumzup® solves
 
According to Inc. Magazine, in 2019, JetBlue Airways did a promotion where it offered free travel to people in exchange for posting about JetBlue on social media. The promotion was deemed not to be a success because many of the people reportedly deleted the posts after claiming the reward. JetBlue had no platform for tracking the influencers and holding them accountable. The Thumzup® Platform allows Advertisers to limit and or cap their advertising spend, as well as allowing the Advertiser to approve individual posts prior to the Creator being paid.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2022, The Company has four (4) full-time employees, as well as sixteen (16) marketing, sales, and finance independent contractors. The Company also utilizes the services of approximately seven (7) part-time software developers. All of these software developers are third-party contractors and are located outside the United States.
Legal Proceedings
 
From time to time, the Company may become involved in litigation or other legal proceedings. The Company is not currently a party to any litigation or legal proceedings. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.
