ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Company
Except where the context otherwise requires or where otherwise indicated, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “we,” “us,” “our,” “our company,” the “Company” or “Guaranty” refer to Guaranty Bancshares, Inc. and our wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Guaranty Bank & Trust, N.A. and the terms “Bank” and "Guaranty Bank & Trust" refers to Guaranty Bank & Trust, N.A..
We are a bank holding company, with corporate headquarters in Addison, Texas and operational headquarters in Mount Pleasant, Texas, and additional executive offices in Bryan, Texas. Through our wholly owned subsidiary, Guaranty Bank & Trust, a national banking association, we provide a wide range of relationship-driven commercial and consumer banking, as well as trust and wealth management, products and services that are tailored to meet the needs of small- and medium-sized businesses, professionals and individuals. The Bank currently operates 30 full service banking locations in East Texas, Central Texas, the Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan statistical area (MSA) and the Houston MSA. As of December 31, 2018, we had total assets of $2.27 billion, total net loans of $1.65 billion, total deposits of $1.87 billion and total shareholders’ equity of $244.6 million.
We completed an initial public offering of our common stock in May 2017 as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol "GNTY."
Our History and Growth
Guaranty Bank & Trust was originally chartered as a Texas state banking association over a century ago in 1913, and converted its charter to a national banking association in 2012. Guaranty was incorporated in 1990 to serve as the holding company for Guaranty Bank & Trust. Since our founding, we have built a strong reputation based on financial stability and community leadership. Our growth has been consistent and primarily organic, both through growth in our established markets and the entry into new markets with de novo banking locations. In 2013, we expanded from our East Texas markets by opening a de novo banking location in Bryan/College Station, Texas. In 2017, we opened de novo banking locations in Fort Worth and Austin, Texas. We have achieved organic growth by enhancing our lending and deposit relationships with existing customers and attracting new customers, as well as cross-selling our deposit, mortgage, trust and wealth management and treasury management products. Our expansion strategy has enabled us to access markets with stronger loan demand, achieve consistent growth, maintain stable operating efficiencies, recruit top bankers, preserve our historically conservative credit culture, and provide shareholders with stable earnings throughout credit cycles.
During the past five years, we have supplemented our organic growth and leveraged our strong deposit base with strategic acquisitions, primarily to assist with our growth in the Dallas/Fort Worth and Houston regions. The following table summarizes, with fair value historical balances at the date of acquisition, our whole bank acquisitions during the last five years.

Institution Acquired | Location | Date Completed | Acquired Assets | | Acquired Loans | Acquired Deposits | | Number of Branches
(Dollars in thousands)
Westbound Bank | Houston MSA | June 2018 | $ | 216,059 | | $ | 154,687 | | $ | 181,421 | 4
Texas Leadership Bank | Dallas/Fort Worth MSA | April 2015 | $ | 76,715 | | $ | 43,568 | | $ | 65,496 | 1
DCB Financial | Dallas/Fort Worth MSA | March 2015 | $ | 130,170 | | $ | 118,154 | | $ | 94,451 | 2

Since our initial expansion outside of East Texas in 2013, we have grown our network of banking locations from 18 banking locations in 11 Texas communities to 30 banking locations in 24 Texas communities. 
Our Community Banking Philosophy and Culture
We focus on a community-based relationship model, as opposed to a line of business model, because we believe the community-based relationship model promotes an entrepreneurial attitude within our Company while 
1

providing personal attention and solutions tailored to our customers. Our culture is one of employee ownership and it is something we take very seriously. In 2016, we formally documented our culture in a book called “The Guaranty Culture,” which we give to all prospective new hires and directors before they join our team so that they clearly understand who we are, how we work, what we believe, how we make decisions and what we admire in people.
We believe a great bank requires the right amount of two forms of capital: financial and human. We understand that our ability to successfully deploy our financial capital is directly related to our ability to bring the right talents together to lead our teams. This focus on human capital has rewarded us with a cohesive group of directors, officers and employees that we believe is our greatest asset. We have invested in a robust leadership development program designed to develop comprehensive bankers who understand all aspects of our operations and embrace our core values. The training program generally lasts 12-18 months and includes rotations through each primary department of the Bank. Successful graduates of our training program are typically promoted to a managerial position upon completion and we currently have graduates in management, lending and operational roles. Several of the Bank’s market presidents and managers are graduates of our training program.
We have developed a network of banking locations strategically positioned in separate and distinct communities. Each community where we have a banking location is overseen by a local market president or manager, and we emphasize local decision-making by experienced bankers supported by centralized risk and credit oversight. We believe that employing local decision makers, supported by industry-leading technology and centralized operational and credit administration support from our corporate headquarters, allows us to serve our customers’ individual needs while managing risk on a uniform basis. We intend to repeat this scalable model in each market in which we are able to identify high-caliber bankers with a strong banking team. We empower these bankers to implement our operating strategy, grow our customer base and provide the highest level of customer service possible. We believe our organizational approach enables us to attract and retain talented bankers and banking teams who desire the combination of the Bank’s size and loan limits, dedication to culture, commitment to our communities, local decision-making authority, compensation structure and focus on relationship banking.
Growth and Expansion Strategies
Our strategic plan is to be a leading Texas bank holding company with a commitment to operate as a community bank as we continue to execute our expansion strategy. Our expansion strategy is to generate shareholder value through the following:

• | Maintain Focus on Organic Growth. Focusing on organic growth is a strategy that allows us to generate stable funding sources without the non-amortizing goodwill assets and core deposit intangibles that strategic acquisitions might add to our balance sheet. We believe that core deposits have become significantly more valuable and desirable because the ability to attract core deposits at a low cost has diminished as interest rates have increased and alternative funding sources have become more expensive. As such, we also believe that our significant core deposit franchise in East Texas provides a stable funding source for meaningful loan growth in existing and new markets. 


• | Pursue Strategic Acquisitions. We intend to continue to grow through strategic acquisitions within our current markets and in other complementary markets, like our recent acquisition in the Houston MSA in June 2018. We seek acquisitions that provide meaningful financial benefits through long-term organic growth opportunities and expense reductions, while maintaining our current risk profile. We believe that many smaller financial institutions will consider us an ideal long-term partner due to our community banking philosophy, commitment to employee stock ownership and our culture of teamwork. 


• | Establish De Novo Banking Locations. We intend to open de novo banking locations in our existing and other attractive markets in Texas to further diversify our banking location network. In 2017, we opened de novo banking locations in each of Austin and Fort Worth, Texas. 


• | Maintain Earnings Streams. We seek to maintain asset quality in a manner that allows us to maintain our current earnings streams, while also providing additional services to our customers in order to augment and diversify our revenue sources. For the year ended December 31, 2018, noninterest income represented approximately $15.3 million, or 18.2%, of our total revenue of $84.2 million (defined as net interest income plus noninterest income). 

The charts below illustrate our meaningful asset, loan, deposit and net income growth for the last five years:

Although we are devoting substantial resources in furtherance of our expansion strategy, there are no assurances that we will be able to further implement our expansion strategy or that any of the components of our expansion strategy will be successful.
We believe the following competitive strengths support our growth and expansion strategy:


• | Experienced Executive Management Team. The Bank has a seasoned and experienced executive management team with more than 285 years of experience in financial services businesses. Our executive management team has successfully managed profitable organic growth, executed acquisitions, developed a strong credit culture and implemented a relationship-based approach to commercial and consumer banking. In addition, our executive management team has extensive knowledge of the bank regulatory landscape, significant experience navigating interest rate and credit cycles and a long history of working together. 


• | Employee Ownership Mentality. As of December 31, 2018, our Company only directors, our executive officers and our employee stock ownership plan, or KSOP, as a group, beneficially owned approximately 29.2% of our outstanding shares of common stock. Our KSOP owned 11.3% of our outstanding shares. Many of our employees’ interests in the KSOP represent material portions of their net worth, particularly our long-tenured employees. We believe that the KSOP’s material ownership position promotes an owner-operator mentality among our employees, from senior officers to entry-level employees, which we believe enhances our employees’ dedication to our organization and the execution of our strategy. 


• | Proven Successful Execution of Growth Strategies. We have developed a strategic growth plan that allows the Company to quickly identify and efficiently execute corporate transactions that we believe enhance our geographic footprint and enterprise value. Since 2011, we have successfully integrated ten acquired locations into our Company through what we believe is an effective combination of comprehensive integration planning, extensive management experience with expansion, and a welcoming and flexible culture of employee ownership. In that same time period, we also established eight de novo locations outside of our historical East Texas market, achieving our objectives for organic growth within our anticipated time periods and successfully integrating new local management teams and employees into our Company. Accordingly, 

3

we have a proven track record of executing value-added acquisitions and achieving consistent, meaningful organic growth.

• | Scalable Platform. Utilizing the significant prior experience of our management team and employees, we believe that we have built a strong and scalable operational platform, including technology and banking processes and infrastructure, capable of supporting future organic growth and acquisitions when the right opportunities arise. We maintain operational systems and staffing that we believe are stronger than necessarily required for a financial institution of our size in order to successfully execute integrations when needed and accommodate future growth without a commensurate need for expansion of our back office capabilities. We believe our platform allows us to focus on growing the revenue-generating divisions of our business while maintaining our operational efficiencies, resulting in improved profitability. 


• | Disciplined Credit Culture and Robust Risk Management Systems. We seek to prudently mitigate and manage our risks through a disciplined, enterprise-wide approach to risk management, particularly credit, compliance, operational and interest rate risk. All of the Bank’s executive officers serve on the Bank’s Enterprise Risk Management Committee. We endeavor to maintain asset quality through an emphasis on local market knowledge, long-term customer relationships, consistent and thorough underwriting for all loans and a conservative credit culture. 


• | Brand Strength and Reputation. We believe our brand recognition, including the Guaranty name and our iconic “G” logo, which is prominently displayed in all of our advertising and marketing materials and has been trademarked to preserve its integrity, is an important element of our business model and a key driver of our future growth. We believe our reputation for providing personal and dependable service and active community involvement is well established in our traditional East Texas market, and we are continuously striving to replicate that brand awareness and reputation in our newer markets of the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex, Houston metroplex and Central Texas through a high level of community involvement and the targeted hiring of employees with strong relationships and reputations within these markets. 


• | Stable Core Deposit Base. We believe our traditional East Texas market provides a historically stable source of core deposits that has become a greater source of funding as interest rates have increased and core deposits have become more difficult and more expensive to attract, especially in more competitive markets. As we enter new markets, we believe that our stable core deposit base enhances our ability to pursue loans in large, high growth markets and to fund other revenue sources such as our warehouse lending division. 

Our Banking Services
Lending Activities.  We offer a variety of loans, including commercial lines of credit, working capital loans, commercial real estate-backed loans (including loans secured by owner occupied commercial properties), term loans, equipment financing, acquisition, expansion and development loans, borrowing base loans, real estate construction loans, homebuilder loans, letters of credit and other loan products to small- and medium-sized businesses, real estate developers, mortgage lenders, manufacturing and industrial companies and other businesses. We also offer various consumer loans to individuals and professionals including residential real estate loans, home equity loans, installment loans, unsecured and secured personal lines of credit, and standby letters of credit. Lending activities originate from the efforts of our bankers, with an emphasis on lending to individuals, professionals, small- to medium-sized businesses and commercial companies located in our market areas. Although all lending involves a degree of risk, we believe that commercial business loans and commercial real estate loans present greater risks than other types of loans in our portfolio. We work to mitigate these risks through conservative underwriting policies and consistent monitoring of credit quality indicators.
We adhere to what we believe are disciplined underwriting standards, but also remain cognizant of the need to serve the credit needs of customers in our primary market areas by offering flexible loan solutions in a responsive and timely manner. We maintain asset quality through an emphasis on local market knowledge, long-term customer relationships, consistent and thorough underwriting for all loans and a conservative credit culture. We also seek to maintain a broadly diversified loan portfolio across customer, product and industry types. Our lending policies do not provide for any loans that are highly speculative, subprime, or that have high loan-to-value ratios. These components, together with active credit management, are the foundation of our credit culture, which we believe is critical to enhancing the long-term value of our organization to our customers, employees, shareholders and communities.
We have a service-driven, relationship-based, business-focused credit culture, rather than a price-driven, transaction-based culture. Substantially all of our loans are made to borrowers located or operating in our primary market areas with whom we have ongoing relationships across various product lines. The limited number of loans secured by properties located in out-of-market areas have been made strictly to borrowers who are well-known to us.

Our credit approval policies provide for various levels of officer and senior management lending authority for new credits and renewals, which are based on position, capability and experience. Loans in excess of an individual officer’s lending limit may be approved by two or more executive officers, with stacking authority, combining their individual lending limits, up to a current maximum of $2.5 million. Loans presenting aggregate lending exposure in excess of $2.5 million are subject to approval of the Bank’s Directors’ Loan Committee. These limits are reviewed periodically by the Bank’s board of directors. We believe that our credit approval process provides for thorough underwriting and efficient decision making.
Credit risk management involves a partnership between our loan officers and our credit approval, credit administration and collections personnel. We conduct monthly loan meetings, attended by substantially all of our loan officers, related loan production staff and credit administration staff at which asset quality and delinquencies are reviewed. Our evaluation and compensation program for our loan officers includes significant goals, such as the percentages of past due loans and charge-offs to total loans in the officer’s portfolio, that we believe motivate the loan officers to focus on the origination and maintenance of high quality credits consistent with our strategic focus on asset quality.
Deposit Activities. Our deposits serve as the primary funding source for lending, investing and other general banking purposes. We provide a full range of deposit products and services, including a variety of checking and savings accounts, certificates of deposit, money market accounts, debit cards, remote deposit capture, online banking, mobile banking, e-Statements, bank-by-mail and direct deposit services. We also offer business accounts and cash management services, including business checking and savings accounts and treasury management services. We solicit deposits through our relationship-driven team of dedicated and accessible bankers and through community focused marketing. We also seek to cross-sell deposit products at loan origination.
Given the diverse nature of our banking location network and our relationship-driven approach to our customers, we believe our deposit base is comparatively less sensitive to interest rate variations than our competitors. Nevertheless, we attempt to competitively price our deposit products to promote core deposit growth. We believe that our loan pricing encourages deposits from our loan customers.
Guaranty Bank & Trust Wealth Management Group. We deliver a comprehensive suite of trust services through Guaranty Bank & Trust Wealth Management Group, a division of our Bank. We provide traditional trustee, custodial and escrow services for institutional and individual accounts, including corporate escrow accounts, serving as custodian for self-directed individual retirement accounts and other retirement accounts. In addition, we offer clients comprehensive investment management solutions whereby we manage all or a portion of a client’s investment portfolio on a discretionary basis. Finally, we provide retirement plan services, such as 401(k) programs, through a national vendor.  
Other Products and Services. We offer banking products and services that are attractively priced with a focus on customer convenience and accessibility. We offer a full suite of online banking services including access to account balances, online transfers, online bill payment and electronic delivery of customer statements, as well as ATMs, and banking by telephone, mail and personal appointment. We also offer debit cards, night depository, direct deposit, cashier’s checks, and letters of credit, as well as treasury management services, including wire transfer services, positive pay, remote deposit capture and automated clearinghouse services.
Investments
We manage our investment portfolio primarily for liquidity purposes, with a secondary focus on returns. We separate our portfolio into two categories: (1) short-term investments with maturities less than one year, including federal funds sold; and (2) investments with maturities exceeding one year (the current duration is approximately 4.7 years), all of which are classified as either available-for-sale or held-to-maturity and can be used for pledging on public deposits, selling under repurchase agreements and meeting unforeseen liquidity needs. We regularly evaluate the composition of this category as changes occur with respect to the interest rate yield curve. Although we may sell investment securities from time to time to take advantage of changes in interest rate spreads, it is our policy not to sell investment securities unless we can reinvest the proceeds at a similar or higher spread, so as not to take gains to the detriment of future income.
5

Our Markets
We consider our current market regions to be East Texas, Central Texas, the Dallas/Fort Worth MSA and the Houston MSA. We serve these communities from our corporate headquarters in Addison, Texas, our operational headquarters in Mount Pleasant, Texas and through a network of 15 banking locations within East Texas, four banking locations in Central Texas, seven banking locations in the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex and four banking locations in the Houston metroplex. As part of our strategic plan, we intend to further diversify our markets through entry into other large metropolitan markets in Texas and/or continued expansion in our existing newer markets.
Competition
The banking and financial services industry is highly competitive, and we compete with a wide range of financial institutions within our markets, including local, regional and national commercial banks and credit unions. We also compete with mortgage companies, brokerage firms, consumer finance companies, mutual funds, securities firms, insurance companies, third-party payment processors, fintech companies and other financial intermediaries for certain of our products and services. Some of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions and level of regulatory supervision applicable to us.
Interest rates on loans and deposits, as well as prices on fee-based services, are typically significant competitive factors within banking and financial services industry. Many of our competitors are much larger financial institutions that have greater financial resources than we do and compete aggressively for market share. These competitors attempt to gain market share through their financial product mix, pricing strategies and banking center locations. Other important competitive factors in our industry and markets include office locations and hours, quality of customer service, community reputation, continuity of personnel and services, capacity and willingness to extend credit, and ability to offer sophisticated banking products and services. While we seek to remain competitive with respect to fees charged, interest rates and pricing, we believe that our broad and sophisticated commercial banking product suite, our high-quality customer service culture, our positive reputation and long-standing community relationships will enable us to compete successfully within our markets and enhance our ability to attract and retain customers.
Our Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed 454 full-time equivalent persons. We provide extensive training to our employees in an effort to ensure that our customers receive superior customer service. None of our employees are represented by any collective bargaining unit or are parties to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Our Corporate Information
Our principal executive offices are located at 16475 Dallas Parkway, Suite 600, Addison, Texas 75001, and our telephone number is (888) 572-9881. Our website is www.gnty.com. We make available at this address, free of charge, our annual report on Form 10-K, our annual report to shareholders, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. These documents are also available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. The information contained on or accessible from our website does not constitute part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is not incorporated by reference herein. 
Supervision and Regulation
The U.S. banking industry is highly regulated under federal and state law. Consequently, our growth and earnings performance will be affected not only by management decisions and general and local economic conditions, but also by the statutes administered by, and the regulations and policies of, various governmental regulatory authorities. These authorities include the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB"), Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC), Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") and state taxing authorities. The effect of these statutes, regulations and policies, and any changes to such statutes, regulations and policies, can be significant and cannot be predicted.

The material statutory and regulatory requirements that are applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries are summarized below. The description below is not intended to summarize all laws and regulations applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries, and is based upon the statutes, regulations, policies, interpretive letters and other written guidance that are in effect as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Guaranty Bancshares, Inc.
As a bank holding company, we are subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, or the BHC Act, and to supervision, examination and enforcement by the Federal Reserve. The BHC Act and other federal laws subject bank holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage, and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations. The Federal Reserve’s jurisdiction also extends to any company that we directly or indirectly control, such as any nonbank subsidiaries and other companies in which we own a controlling investment.
Financial Services Industry Reform. On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted. The Dodd-Frank Act broadly affects the financial services industry by implementing changes to the financial regulatory landscape aimed at strengthening the sound operation of the financial services sector, including provisions that, among other things:

• | establish the CFPB, an independent organization within the Federal Reserve dedicated to promulgating and enforcing consumer protection laws applicable to all entities offering consumer financial products or services;


• | apply the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to most bank holding companies, which, among other things, will require us to deduct all trust preferred securities issued on or after May 19, 2010 from our Tier 1 capital (existing trust preferred securities issued prior to May 19, 2010 for all bank holding companies with less than $15.0 billion in total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2009 are exempt from this requirement);


• | broaden the base for FDIC insurance assessments from the amount of insured deposits to average total consolidated assets less average tangible equity during the assessment period (subject to risk-based adjustments that would further reduce the assessment base for custodial banks) rather than domestic deposits;


• | permanently increase FDIC deposit insurance maximum to $250,000;


• | eliminate the upper limit for the reserve ratio designated by the FDIC each year, increase the minimum designated reserve ratio of the deposit insurance fund from 1.15% to 1.35% of the estimated amount of total insured deposits by September 30, 2020 and eliminate the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds;


• | permit banking organizations with less than $15.0 billion in consolidated assets as of December 31, 2009 to include in Tier 1 capital trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock issued and included in Tier 1 capital prior to May 19, 2010 on a permanent basis, without any phase out;


• | permit banks to engage in de novo interstate branching if the laws of the state where the new branch is to be established would permit the establishment of the branch if it were part of a bank that were chartered by such state;


• | repeal the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts;


• | requires bank holding companies and banks to be “well capitalized” and “well managed” in order to acquire banks located outside of their home state and requires any bank holding company electing to be treated as a financial holding company to be “well capitalized” and “well managed;”


• | directs the Federal Reserve to establish interchange fees for debit cards under a “reasonable and proportional cost” per transaction standard;


• | increases regulation of consumer protections regarding mortgage originations, including originator compensation, minimum repayment standards, and prepayment consideration;


• | restricts the preemption of select state laws by federal banking law applicable to national banks and removes federal preemption for subsidiaries and affiliates of national banks;


• | implement corporate governance revisions, including with regard to executive compensation and proxy access by shareholders, that apply to all public companies, not just financial institutions; and


• | increase the authority of the Federal Reserve to examine us and any nonbank subsidiaries.

In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act addresses many investor protection, corporate governance and executive compensation matters that will affect publicly-traded companies. However, under the JOBS Act there are certain exceptions to these requirements for so long as a publicly-traded company qualifies as an emerging growth company.
7

The requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act are still in the process of being implemented over time and most will be subject to regulations implemented over the course of several years. Given the uncertainty associated with the manner in which the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will be implemented by the various regulatory agencies and through regulations, the full extent of the impact such requirements will have on our operations is unclear. Changes resulting from further implementation of, changes to, or repeal of the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with the new requirements may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.
Revised Rules on Regulatory Capital. Regulatory capital rules pursuant to the Basel III requirements, released in July 2013 and effective January 1, 2015, implement higher minimum capital requirements for bank holding companies and banks. These rules include a new common equity Tier 1, or CET1, capital requirement and establish criteria that instruments must meet to be considered common equity Tier 1 capital, additional Tier 1 capital or Tier 2 capital. These enhancements are designed to both improve the quality and increase the quantity of capital required to be held by banking organizations, better equipping the U.S. banking system to cope with adverse economic conditions. The revised capital rules require banks and bank holding companies to maintain a minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-based assets, a total Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% of risk-based assets, a total capital ratio of 8.0% of risk-based assets and a leverage ratio of 4.0% of average assets.
The capital rules also require banks to maintain a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5%, a total Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.0%, a total capital ratio of 10.0% and a leverage ratio of 5.0% to be deemed “well capitalized” for purposes of certain rules and prompt corrective action requirements. The risk-based ratios include a “capital conservation buffer” of 2.5% above its minimum risk-based capital requirements that must be composed of common equity Tier 1 capital. This buffer will help to ensure that banking organizations conserve capital when it is most needed, allowing them to better weather periods of economic stress. The buffer is measured relative to risk-weighted assets. The capital conservation buffer began phasing in in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase by that amount each year until fully implemented in January 2019. Although these new capital ratios do not become fully phased in until 2019, the banking regulators will generally expect bank holding companies and banks to meet these requirements well ahead of that date. An institution would be subject to limitations on certain activities including payment of dividends, share repurchases and discretionary bonuses to executive officers if its capital level is below the buffered ratio.
The new capital rules also attempt to improve the quality of capital by implementing changes to the definition of capital. Among the most important changes are stricter eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments that would disallow the inclusion of certain instruments, such as trust preferred securities (other than grandfathered trust preferred securities such as those issued by the Company), in Tier 1 capital going forward and new constraints on the inclusion of minority interests, mortgage-servicing assets, deferred tax assets and certain investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions. In addition, the new rule requires that most regulatory capital deductions be made from CET1 capital.
The Federal Reserve may also set higher capital requirements for holding companies whose circumstances warrant it. For example, holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets. At this time, the bank regulatory agencies are more inclined to impose higher capital requirements to meet well-capitalized standards and future regulatory change could impose higher capital standards as a routine matter. The Company’s regulatory capital ratios and those of the Bank are in excess of the levels established for “well-capitalized” institutions under the rules.
These rules also set forth certain changes in the methods of calculating certain risk-weighted assets, which in turn will affect the calculation of risk based ratios. Under the new rules, higher or more sensitive risk weights have been assigned to various categories of assets, including, certain credit facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property, certain exposures or credits that are 90 days past due or on non-accrual status, foreign exposures and certain corporate exposures. In addition, these rules include greater recognition of collateral and guarantees, and revised capital treatment for derivatives and repo-style transactions.
On November 21, 2018, federal regulators released a proposed rulemaking that would, if enacted, provide certain banks and their holding companies with the option to elect out of complying with the Basel III Capital Rules. 
8

Under the proposal, a qualifying community banking organization would be eligible to elect the community bank leverage ratio framework if it has a community bank leverage ratio, or CBLR, greater than 9% at the time of election.
A qualifying community banking organization, or QCBO, is defined as a bank, a savings association, a bank holding company or a savings and loan holding company with:

• | total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion;


• | total off-balance sheet exposures (excluding derivatives other than credit derivatives and unconditionally cancelable commitments) of 25% or less of total consolidated assets;


• | total trading assets and trading liabilities of 5% or less of total consolidated assets;


• | MSAs of 25% or less of CBLR tangible equity; and


• | temporary difference DTAs of 25% or less of CBLR tangible equity.

A QCBO may elect out of complying with the Basel III Capital Rules if, at the time of the election, the QCBO has a CBLR above 9%. The numerator of the CBLR is referred to as ‘‘CBLR tangible equity’’ and is calculated as the QCBO’s total capital as reported in compliance with Call Report and FR Y-9C instructions, or Reporting Instructions (prior to including non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries) less:

• | Accumulated other comprehensive income (referred to in the industry as AOCI);


• | Intangible assets, calculated in accordance with Reporting Instructions, other than mortgage servicing assets; and


• | Deferred tax assets that arise from net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards net of any related valuations allowances.

The denominator of the CBLR is the QCBO’s average assets, calculated in accordance with Reporting Instructions and less intangible assets and deferred tax assets deducted from CBLR tangible equity. The Company will continue to monitor this rulemaking. If and when the rulemaking goes into effect, the Company and the Bank will consider whether it would be possible and advantageous at that time to elect to comply with the community bank leverage ratio framework.
Imposition of Liability for Undercapitalized Subsidiaries. Bank regulators are required to take prompt corrective action to resolve problems associated with insured depository institutions whose capital declines below certain levels. In the event an institution becomes undercapitalized, it must submit a capital restoration plan. The capital restoration plan will not be accepted by the regulators unless each company having control of the undercapitalized institution guarantees the subsidiary’s compliance with the capital restoration plan up to a certain specified amount. Any such guarantee from a depository institution’s holding company is entitled to a priority of payment in bankruptcy.
The aggregate liability of the holding company of an undercapitalized bank is limited to the lesser of 5.0% of the institution’s assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the amount necessary to cause the institution to be adequately capitalized. The bank regulators have greater power in situations where an institution becomes significantly or critically undercapitalized or fails to submit a capital restoration plan. For example, a bank holding company controlling such an institution can be required to obtain prior Federal Reserve approval of proposed dividends, or might be required to consent to a consolidation or to divest the troubled institution or other affiliates.
Acquisitions by Bank Holding Companies. The BHC Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before it acquires all or substantially all of the assets of any bank, or ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank or bank holding company if after such acquisition it would own or control, directly or indirectly, more than 5.0% of the voting shares of such bank or bank holding company. In approving bank or bank holding company acquisitions by bank holding companies, the Federal Reserve is required to consider, among other things, the effect of the acquisition on competition, the financial condition, managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding company and the banks concerned, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served (including the record of performance under the CRA), the effectiveness of the applicant in combating money laundering activities and the extent to which the proposed acquisition would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system. Our ability to make future acquisitions will depend on our ability to obtain approval for such acquisitions from the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve could deny our application based on the above criteria or other considerations. For example, we could be required to sell banking centers as a condition to receiving regulatory approval, which condition may not be acceptable to us or, if acceptable to us, may reduce the benefit of a proposed acquisition.

Control Acquisitions. Federal and state laws, including the BHC Act and the Change in Bank Control Act, or CBCA, impose additional prior notice or approval requirements and ongoing regulatory requirements on any investor that seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of an FDIC-insured depository institution or bank holding company. Whether an investor “controls” a depository institution is based on all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the investment. As a general matter, an investor is deemed to control a depository institution or other company if the investor owns or controls 25.0% or more of any class of voting securities. Subject to rebuttal, an investor is presumed to control a depository institution or other company if the investor owns or controls 10.0% or more of any class of voting securities and either the depository institution or company is a public company or no other person will hold a greater percentage of that class of voting securities after the acquisition. If an investor’s ownership of our voting securities were to exceed certain thresholds, the investor could be deemed to “control” us for regulatory purposes, which could subject such investor to regulatory filings or other regulatory consequences. The requirements of the BHCA and the CBCA could limit our access to capital and could limit parties who could acquire shares of our common stock.
Regulatory Restrictions on Dividends; Source of Strength. We are regarded as a legal entity separate and distinct from Guaranty Bank & Trust. The principal source of our revenues is dividends received from Guaranty Bank & Trust. Federal law currently imposes limitations upon certain capital distributions by national banks, such as certain cash dividends, payments to repurchase or otherwise acquire its shares, payments to shareholders of another institution in a cash-out merger and other distributions charged against capital. The Federal Reserve and OCC regulate all capital distributions by the Bank directly or indirectly to the Company, including dividend payments. The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement that provides that a bank holding company should not pay dividends unless (1) its net income over the last four quarters (net of dividends paid) has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends, (2) the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition of the bank holding company and its subsidiaries and (3) the bank holding company will continue to meet minimum required capital adequacy ratios. Accordingly, we should not pay cash dividends that exceed our net income in any year or that can only be funded in ways that weaken our financial strength, including by borrowing money to pay dividends.
Under Federal Reserve policy, bank holding companies have historically been required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of their banking subsidiaries, and the Dodd-Frank Act codified this policy as a statutory requirement. Under this requirement, we are expected to commit resources to support Guaranty Bank & Trust, including at times when we may not be in a financial position to provide such resources. Any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. As discussed below, a bank holding company, in certain circumstances, could be required to guarantee the capital restoration plan of an undercapitalized banking subsidiary. If the capital of Guaranty Bank & Trust were to become impaired, the Federal Reserve could assess us for the deficiency. If we failed to pay the assessment within three months, the Federal Reserve could order the sale of our stock in Guaranty Bank & Trust to cover the deficiency.
In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the trustee will be deemed to have assumed and will be required to cure immediately any deficit under any commitment by the debtor holding company to any of the federal banking agencies to maintain the capital of an insured depository institution, and any claim for breach of such obligation will generally have priority over most other unsecured claims.
Scope of Permissible Activities. Under the BHC Act, we are prohibited from acquiring a direct or indirect interest in or control of more than 5.0% of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank or financial holding company and from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to or performing services for its subsidiary banks, except that we may engage in, directly or indirectly, and may own shares of companies engaged in certain activities found by the Federal Reserve to be so closely related to banking or managing and controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. These activities include, among others, operating a mortgage, finance, credit card or factoring company; performing certain data processing operations; providing investment and financial advice; acting as an insurance agent for certain types of credit-related insurance; leasing personal property on a full-payout, nonoperating basis; and providing certain stock brokerage and investment advisory services. In approving acquisitions or the addition of activities, the Federal Reserve considers, among other things, whether the acquisition or the additional activities can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency, that outweigh such possible adverse effects as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest or unsound banking practices.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, also known as the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, effective March 11, 2000, or the GLB Act, amended the BHC Act and eliminated the barriers to affiliations among banks, securities firms, insurance companies and other financial service providers. The GLB Act permits bank holding companies to become financial holding companies and thereby affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature. The GLB Act defines “financial in nature” to include, among other things, securities underwriting, dealing and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting and agency; merchant banking activities; and activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be closely related to banking. No regulatory approval will be required for a financial holding company to acquire a company, other than a bank or savings association, engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature, as determined by the Federal Reserve. We currently have no plans to make a financial holding company election, although we may make a financial holding company election in the future if we engage in any lines of business that are impermissible for bank holding companies but permissible for financial holding companies.
Safe and Sound Banking Practices. Bank holding companies are not permitted to engage in unsafe and unsound banking practices. The Federal Reserve’s Regulation Y, for example, generally requires a bank holding company to provide the Federal Reserve with prior notice of any redemption or repurchase of its own equity securities, if the consideration to be paid, together with the consideration paid for any repurchases or redemptions in the preceding year, is equal to 10.0% or more of the bank holding company’s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may oppose the transaction if it believes that the transaction would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law or regulation. In certain circumstances, the Federal Reserve could take the position that paying a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice.
The Federal Reserve has broad authority to prohibit activities of bank holding companies and their nonbanking subsidiaries which represent unsafe and unsound banking practices, result in breaches of fiduciary duty or which constitute violations of laws or regulations, and can assess civil money penalties or impose enforcement action for such activities. The penalties can be as high as $1,000,000 for each day the activity continues.
Anti-tying Restrictions. Bank holding companies and their affiliates are prohibited from tying the provision of certain services, such as extensions of credit, to other nonbanking services offered by a bank holding company or its affiliates.
Guaranty Bank & Trust, N.A.
The Bank is subject to various requirements and restrictions under the laws of the United States, and to regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC. The Bank is also an insured depository institution and, therefore, subject to regulation by the FDIC, although the OCC is the Bank’s primary federal regulator. The OCC and the FDIC have the power to enforce compliance with applicable banking statutes and regulations. Such requirements and restrictions include requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, restrictions on the nature and amount of loans that may be made and the interest that may be charged thereon and restrictions relating to investments and other activities of the Bank.
Capital Adequacy Requirements. The OCC monitors the capital adequacy of the Bank by using a combination of risk-based guidelines and leverage ratios. The OCC considers the Bank’s capital levels when taking action on various types of applications and when conducting supervisory activities related to the safety and soundness of the Bank and the banking system. Under the revised capital rules which became effective on January 1, 2015, national banks are required to maintain four minimum capital standards: (1) a Tier 1 capital to adjusted total assets ratio, or “leverage capital ratio,” of at least 4.0%, (2) a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio, or “Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio,” of at least 6.0%, (3) a total risk-based capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to risk-weighted assets ratio, or “total risk-based capital ratio,” of at least 8.0%, and (4) a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%. In addition, the OCC’s prompt corrective action standards discussed below, in effect, increase the minimum regulatory capital ratios for banking organizations. These capital requirements are minimum requirements. Higher capital levels may be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profiles of individual institutions, or if required by the banking regulators due to the economic conditions impacting our market. For example, OCC regulations provide that higher capital may be required to take adequate account of, among other things, interest rate risk and the risks posed by concentrations of credit, nontraditional activities or securities trading activities.
Corrective Measures for Capital Deficiencies. The federal banking regulators are required by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, or FDI Act, to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to capital-deficient institutions that 
11

are FDIC-insured. Agency regulations define, for each capital category, the levels at which institutions are “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” Under the revised capital rules, which became effective on January 1, 2015, a “well capitalized” bank has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or higher, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or higher, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or higher, a CETI capital ratio of 6.5% or higher, and is not subject to any written agreement, order or directive requiring it to maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. An “adequately capitalized” bank has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or higher, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or higher, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or higher (3.0% or higher if the bank was rated a composite 1 in its most recent examination report and is not experiencing significant growth), a CETI capital ratio of 4.5% or higher, and does not meet the criteria for a well-capitalized bank. A bank is “undercapitalized” if it fails to meet any one of the ratios required to be adequately capitalized.
In addition to requiring undercapitalized institutions to submit a capital restoration plan, agency regulations contain broad restrictions on certain activities of undercapitalized institutions including asset growth, acquisitions, branch establishment and expansion into new lines of business. With certain exceptions, an insured depository institution is prohibited from making capital distributions, including dividends, and is prohibited from paying management fees to control persons if the institution would be undercapitalized after any such distribution or payment.
As a national bank’s capital decreases, the OCC’s enforcement powers become more severe. A significantly undercapitalized national bank is subject to mandated capital raising activities, restrictions on interest rates paid and transactions with affiliates, removal of management and other restrictions. The OCC has very limited discretion in dealing with a critically undercapitalized national bank and is virtually required to appoint a receiver or conservator.
Banks with risk-based capital and leverage ratios below the required minimums may also be subject to certain administrative actions, including the termination of deposit insurance upon notice and hearing, or a temporary suspension of insurance without a hearing in the event the institution has no tangible capital.
Branching. National banks are required by the National Bank Act to adhere to branching laws applicable to state banks in the states in which they are located. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, de novo interstate branching by national banks is permitted if, under the laws of the state where the branch is to be located, a state bank chartered in that state would have been permitted to establish a branch. Under current Texas law, banks are permitted to establish branch offices throughout Texas with prior regulatory approval. In addition, with prior regulatory approval, banks are permitted to acquire branches of existing banks located in Texas. Banks located in Texas may also branch across state lines by merging with banks or by purchasing a branch of another bank in other states if allowed by the applicable states’ laws.
Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders. Transactions between the Bank and its nonbanking subsidiaries and/or affiliates, including us, are subject to Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W. In general, Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act imposes limits on the amount of such transactions, and also requires certain levels of collateral for loans to affiliated parties. It also limits the amount of advances to third parties which are collateralized by the securities or obligations of the Company or its subsidiaries. Covered transactions with any single affiliate may not exceed 10.0% of the capital stock and surplus of the Bank, and covered transactions with all affiliates may not exceed, in the aggregate, 20.0% of the Bank’s capital and surplus. For a bank, capital stock and surplus refers to the bank’s Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital, as calculated under the risk-based capital guidelines, plus the balance of the allowance for credit losses excluded from Tier 2 capital. The Bank’s transactions with all of its affiliates in the aggregate are limited to 20.0% of the foregoing capital. “Covered transactions” are defined by statute to include a loan or extension of credit to an affiliate, as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate, a purchase of assets (unless otherwise exempted by the Federal Reserve) from the affiliate, the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan, and the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate. In addition, in connection with covered transactions that are extensions of credit, the Bank may be required to hold collateral to provide added security to the Bank, and the types of permissible collateral may be limited. The Dodd-Frank Act generally enhances the restrictions on transactions with affiliates, including an expansion of what types of transactions are covered transactions to include credit exposures related to derivatives, repurchase agreement and securities lending arrangements and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be satisfied.
Affiliate transactions are also subject to Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act which generally requires that certain transactions between the Bank and its affiliates be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving other nonaffiliated persons. The 
12

Federal Reserve has also issued Regulation W which codifies prior regulations under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and interpretive guidance with respect to affiliate transactions.
The restrictions on loans to directors, executive officers, principal shareholders and their related interests (collectively referred to herein as “insiders”) contained in Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and in Regulation O promulgated by the Federal Reserve apply to all insured institutions and their subsidiaries and bank holding companies. These restrictions include limits on loans to one borrower and conditions that must be met before such a loan can be made. There is also an aggregate limitation on all loans to insiders and their related interests. Generally, the aggregate of these loans cannot exceed the institution’s total unimpaired capital and surplus, although a bank’s regulators may determine that a lesser amount is appropriate. Loans to senior executive officers of a bank are even further restricted. Insiders are subject to enforcement actions for accepting loans in violation of applicable restrictions.
Restrictions on Distribution of Bank Dividends and Assets. Dividends paid by the Bank have provided a substantial part of our operating funds and for the foreseeable future it is anticipated that dividends paid by the Bank to us will continue to be our principal source of operating funds. Earnings and capital adequacy requirements serve to limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the Bank. In general terms, federal law provides that the Bank’s board of directors may, from time to time and as it deems expedient, declare a dividend out of its net profits. Generally, the total of all dividends declared in a year shall not, unless approved by the OCC, exceed the net profits of that year combined with its net profits of the past two years. At December 31, 2018, the Bank had $30.2 million available for payment of dividends.
In addition, under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, or FDICIA, the Bank may not pay any dividend if it is undercapitalized or the payment of the dividend would cause it to become undercapitalized. The OCC may further restrict the payment of dividends by requiring that the Bank maintain a higher level of capital than otherwise required for it to be adequately capitalized for regulatory purposes. Moreover, if, in the opinion of the OCC, the Bank is engaged in an unsound practice (which could include the payment of dividends), it may require, generally after notice and hearing, that the Bank cease such practice. The OCC has indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe banking practice. The OCC has also issued policy statements providing that insured depository institutions generally should pay dividends only out of current operating earnings.
Further, in the event of a liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors and other general or subordinated creditors are entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of holders of any obligation of the institution to its shareholders, including any depository institution holding company (such as us) or any shareholder or creditor thereof.
Incentive Compensation Guidance. The federal banking agencies have issued comprehensive guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of those organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The incentive compensation guidance sets expectations for banking organizations concerning their incentive compensation arrangements and related risk-management, control and governance processes. The incentive compensation guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon three primary principles: (1) balanced risk-taking incentives, (2) compatibility with effective controls and risk management and (3) strong corporate governance. Any deficiencies in compensation practices that are identified may be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings, which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or take other actions. In addition, under the incentive compensation guidance, a banking organization’s federal supervisor may initiate enforcement action if the organization’s incentive compensation arrangements pose a risk to the safety and soundness of the organization. Further, a provision of the Basel III capital standards described above would limit discretionary bonus payments to bank executives if the institution’s regulatory capital ratios fail to exceed certain thresholds. A number of federal regulatory agencies proposed rules that would require enhanced disclosure of incentive-based compensation arrangements initially in April 2011, and again in April and May 2016, but the rules have not been finalized and would mostly apply to banking organizations with over $50 billion in total assets. The scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators’ policies on executive compensation are continuing to develop and are likely to continue evolving in the near future.
Audit Reports. For insured institutions with total assets of $1.0 billion or more, financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, management’s certifications signed by our and the Bank’s chief executive officer and chief accounting or financial officer concerning management’s responsibility for the financial statements, and an attestation by the auditors regarding the Bank’s internal controls must be submitted. For institutions with total assets of more 
13

than $3.0 billion, independent auditors may be required to review quarterly financial statements. FDICIA requires that the Bank have an independent audit committee, consisting of outside directors only, or that we have an audit committee that is entirely independent. The committees of such institutions must include members with experience in banking or financial management, must have access to outside counsel and must not include representatives of large customers. The Bank’s audit committee consists entirely of independent directors.
Deposit Insurance Assessments. The FDIC insures the deposits of federally insured banks up to prescribed statutory limits for each depositor through the Deposit Insurance Fund and safeguards the safety and soundness of the banking and thrift industries. The maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks and savings institutions is $250,000 per depositor. The amount of FDIC assessments paid by each insured depository institution is based on its relative risk of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory factors and is calculated based on an institution’s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity.
We are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. At least semi-annually, the FDIC will update its loss and income projections for the Deposit Insurance Fund and, if needed, will increase or decrease assessment rates, following notice-and-comment rulemaking, if required. If there are additional bank or financial institution failures or if the FDIC otherwise determines to increase assessment rates, the Bank may be required to pay higher FDIC insurance premiums. Any future increases in FDIC insurance premiums may have a material and adverse effect on our earnings.
In addition, all FDIC-insured institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, or FICO, an agency of the federal government established to recapitalize the predecessor to the Deposit Insurance Fund. These assessments, which are included in Deposit Insurance Premiums on the Consolidated Statements of Income, will continue until the FICO bonds mature between 2017 and 2019.
Financial Modernization. Under the GLB Act, banks may establish financial subsidiaries and engage, subject to limitations on investment, in activities that are financial in nature, other than insurance underwriting as principal, insurance company portfolio investment, real estate development, real estate investment, annuity issuance and merchant banking activities. To do so, a bank must be well capitalized, well managed and have a CRA rating from its primary federal regulator of satisfactory or better. Subsidiary banks of financial holding companies or banks with financial subsidiaries must remain well capitalized and well managed in order to continue to engage in activities that are financial in nature without regulatory actions or restrictions. Such actions or restrictions could include divestiture of the “financial in nature” subsidiary or subsidiaries. In addition, a financial holding company or a bank may not acquire a company that is engaged in activities that are financial in nature unless each of the subsidiary banks of the financial holding company or the bank has a CRA rating of satisfactory of better. Neither we nor the Bank maintains a financial subsidiary.
Brokered Deposit Restrictions. Insured depository institutions that are categorized as adequately capitalized institutions under the FDI Act and corresponding federal regulations cannot accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits, without receiving a waiver from the FDIC, and are subject to restrictions on the interest rates that can be paid on any deposits. Insured depository institutions that are categorized as undercapitalized capitalized institutions under the FDI Act and corresponding federal regulations may not accept, renew, or roll over brokered deposits. The Bank is not currently subject to such restrictions.
Concentrated Commercial Real Estate Lending Regulations. The federal banking regulatory agencies have promulgated guidance governing financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The guidance provides that a bank has a concentration in commercial real estate lending if (1) total reported loans for acquisition, construction, land development, and other land represent 100.0% or more of total capital or (2) total reported loans secured by multifamily and nonfarm residential properties and loans for acquisition, construction, land development, and other land represent 300.0% or more of total capital and the bank’s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months. Owner occupied loans are excluded from this second category. If a concentration is present, management must employ heightened risk management practices that address, among other things, Board and management oversight and strategic planning, portfolio management, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing, and maintenance of increased capital levels as needed to support the level of commercial real estate lending. We are currently operating with real estate loan portfolios within such percentage levels.

Community Reinvestment Act. The CRA and the regulations issued thereunder are intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their entire assessment area, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operations of such banks. These regulations also provide for regulatory assessment of a bank’s record in meeting the needs of its assessment area when considering applications to establish branches, merger applications and applications to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of another bank. FIRREA requires federal banking agencies to make public a rating of a bank’s performance under the CRA. In the case of a bank holding company, the CRA performance record of the banks involved in the transaction are reviewed in connection with the filing of an application to acquire ownership or control of shares or assets of a bank or to merge with any other bank holding company. An unsatisfactory CRA record could substantially delay approval or result in denial of an application. The Bank received a “satisfactory” rating in its most recent CRA examination.
Consumer Laws and Regulations. The Bank is subject to numerous laws and regulations intended to protect consumers in transactions with the Bank. These laws include, among others, laws regarding unfair, deceptive and abusive acts and practices, usury laws, and other federal consumer protection statutes. These federal laws include the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Real Estate Procedures Act of 1974, the S.A.F.E. Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008, the Truth in Lending Act and the Truth in Savings Act, among others. Many states and local jurisdictions have consumer protection laws analogous, and in addition, to those enacted under federal law. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans and conducting other types of transactions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could give rise to regulatory sanctions, customer rescission and registration rights, action by state and local attorneys general and civil or criminal liability.
In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB. The CFPB has broad authority to regulate the offering and provision of consumer financial products. The CFPB officially came into being on July 21, 2011, and rulemaking authority for a range of consumer financial protection laws (such as the Truth in Lending Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, among others) transferred from the Federal Reserve and other federal regulators to the CFPB on that date. The Dodd-Frank Act gives the CFPB authority to supervise and examine depository institutions with more than $10.0 billion in assets for compliance with these federal consumer laws. The authority to supervise and examine depository institutions with $10.0 billion or less in assets for compliance with federal consumer laws remains largely with those institutions’ primary regulators. However, the CFPB may participate in examinations of these smaller institutions on a “sampling basis” and may refer potential enforcement actions against such institutions to their primary regulators. Accordingly, the CFPB may participate in examinations of the Bank, which currently has assets of less than $10.0 billion, and could supervise and examine our other direct or indirect subsidiaries that offer consumer financial products or services. The CFPB also has supervisory and examination authority over certain nonbank institutions that offer consumer financial products. The Dodd-Frank Act identifies a number of covered nonbank institutions, and also authorizes the CFPB to identify additional institutions that will be subject to its jurisdiction. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are stricter than those regulations promulgated by the CFPB, and state attorneys general are permitted to enforce consumer protection rules adopted by the CFPB against certain institutions.
Mortgage Lending Rules. The Dodd-Frank Act authorized the CFPB to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages, including a determination of the borrower’s ability to repay. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, financial institutions may not make a residential mortgage loan unless they make a “reasonable and good faith determination” that the consumer has a “reasonable ability” to repay the loan. The Dodd-Frank Act allows borrowers to raise certain defenses to foreclosure but provides a full or partial safe harbor from such defenses for loans that are “qualified mortgages.” On January 10, 2013, the CFPB published final rules to, among other things, specify the types of income and assets that may be considered in the ability-to-repay determination, the permissible sources for income verification, and the required methods of calculating the loan’s monthly payments. Since then the CFPB made certain modifications to these rules. The rules extend the requirement that creditors verify and document a borrower’s income and assets to include all information that creditors rely on in determining repayment ability. The rules also provide further examples of third-party documents that may be relied on for such verification, such as government records and check-cashing or funds-transfer service receipts. The new rules became effective on January 10, 2014. The rules also define “qualified mortgages,” imposing both underwriting standards - for example, a borrower’s debt-to-income ratio may not exceed 43.0% - and limits on the terms of their loans. Points and fees are subject to a relatively stringent cap, and the terms include a wide array of payments that may be made in the course of closing a loan. Certain loans, including interest-only loans and negative amortization loans, cannot be qualified mortgages.
15

Anti-Money Laundering and OFAC. Under federal law, including the Bank Secrecy Act, or BSA, and the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, certain financial institutions, such as the Bank, must maintain anti-money laundering programs that include established internal policies, procedures and controls; a designated BSA officer; an ongoing employee training program; and testing of the program by an independent audit function. Financial institutions are also prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must meet enhanced standards for due diligence and customer identification especially in their dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers. Financial institutions must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions, and law enforcement authorities have been granted increased access to financial information maintained by financial institutions. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, issued final rules under the BSA in July 2016 that clarify and strengthen the due diligence requirements for banks with regard to their customers, which must be complied with no later than May 2018.
The Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, administers laws and Executive Orders that prohibit U.S. entities from engaging in transactions with certain prohibited parties. OFAC publishes lists of persons and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, known as Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. Generally, if a bank identifies a transaction, account or wire transfer relating to a person or entity on an OFAC list, it must freeze the account or block the transaction, file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities.
Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and they must consider an institution’s compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications, including applications for bank mergers and acquisitions. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing and comply with OFAC sanctions, or to comply with relevant laws and regulations, could have serious legal, reputational and financial consequences for the institution. 
Privacy. The federal banking regulators have adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a non-affiliated third party. These regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through financial services companies and conveyed to outside vendors. In addition, consumers may also prevent disclosure of certain information among affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service, such as that shown on consumer credit reports and asset and income information from applications. Consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services. In addition to applicable federal privacy regulations, the Bank is subject to certain state privacy laws.
Federal Home Loan Bank System. The FHLB system, of which the Bank is a member, consists of 12 regional FHLBs governed and regulated by the Federal Housing Finance Board, or FHFB. The FHLBs serve as reserve or credit facilities for member institutions within their assigned regions. The reserves are funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB system. The FHLBs make loans (i.e., advances) to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the FHLB and the Boards of directors of each regional FHLB.
As a system member, according to currently existing policies and procedures, the Bank is entitled to borrow from the Dallas FHLB provided it posts acceptable collateral. The Bank is also required to own a certain amount of capital stock in the FHLB. The Bank is in compliance with the stock ownership rules with respect to such advances, commitments and letters of credit and collateral requirements with respect to home mortgage loans and similar obligations. All loans, advances and other extensions of credit made by the FHLB to the Bank are secured by a portion of the respective mortgage loan portfolio, certain other investments and the capital stock of the FHLB held by the Bank.
Enforcement Powers. The federal banking agencies, including our primary federal regulator, the OCC, have broad enforcement powers, including the power to terminate deposit insurance, impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties, and appoint a conservator or receiver. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and supervisory agreements, breaches of fiduciary duty or the maintenance of unsafe and unsound conditions or practices could subject the Company or the Bank and their subsidiaries, as well as their respective officers, directors, and other institution-affiliated parties, to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil money penalties. For example, the regulatory authorities may appoint the FDIC as conservator or receiver for a banking institution (or the FDIC may appoint itself, under certain circumstances) if any one or more of a number of circumstances exist, including, without limitation, the fact that the banking institution is undercapitalized and has no reasonable prospect of becoming

adequately capitalized, fails to become adequately capitalized when required to do so, fails to submit a timely and acceptable capital restoration plan or materially fails to implement an accepted capital restoration plan.
Effect of Governmental Monetary Policies
The commercial banking business is affected not only by general economic conditions but also by U.S. fiscal policy and the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve. Some of the instruments of monetary policy available to the Federal Reserve include changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings, the fluctuating availability of borrowings at the “discount window,” open market operations, the imposition of and changes in reserve requirements against member banks’ deposits and certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates and assets of foreign branches. These policies influence to a significant extent the overall growth of bank loans, investments, and deposits and the interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. We cannot predict the nature of future fiscal and monetary policies or the effect of these policies on our operations and activities, financial condition, results of operations, growth plans or future prospects.
New Banking Reform Legislation
The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, or the EGRRCPA, directs the federal banking agencies to develop a specified CBLR of not less than 8% and not more than 10%. Banks and bank holding companies with less than $10 billion in total assets that maintain capital in excess of this ratio will be deemed to be in compliance with all other capital and leverage requirements. Federal banking agencies may consider a company’s risk profile when evaluating whether it qualifies as a community bank for purposes of the Community Bank Leverage Ratio.
Other key provisions of the EGRRCPA as it relates to community banks and bank holding companies include, but are not limited to: (i) designating mortgages held in portfolio as ‘‘qualified mortgages’’ for banks with less than $10 billion in assets, subject to certain documentation and product limitations; (ii) exempting banks with less than $10 billion in assets (and total trading assets and trading liabilities of 5% or less of total assets) from Volcker Rule requirements relating to proprietary trading; (iii) simplifying capital calculations for banks with less than $10 billion in assets by requiring federal banking agencies to establish a community bank leverage ratio of tangible equity to average consolidated assets of not less than 8% or more than 10%, and provide that banks that maintain tangible equity in excess of such ratio will be deemed to be in compliance with risk-based capital and leverage requirements; (iv) assisting smaller banks with obtaining stable funding by providing an exception for reciprocal deposits from FDIC restrictions on acceptance of brokered deposits; (v) raising the eligibility for use of short-form Call Reports from $1 billion to $5 billion in assets; (vi) clarifying definitions pertaining to HVCRE, which require higher capital allocations, so that only loans with increased risk are subject to higher risk weightings; and (vii) changing the eligibility for use of the small bank holding company policy statement from institutions with under $1 billion in assets to institutions with under $3 billion in assets.
At this time, it is difficult to anticipate the continued impact this expansive legislation will have on the Company, its customers and the financial industry generally. To the extent the Dodd-Frank Act remains in place or is not further amended, it is likely to continue to increase the Company’s cost of doing business, limit the Bank’s permissible activities, and affect the competitive balance within the industry and market.
Impact of Current Laws and Regulations
The cumulative effect of these laws and regulations, while providing certain benefits, adds significantly to the cost of our operations and thus have a negative impact on our profitability. There has also been a notable expansion in recent years of financial service providers that are not subject to the examination, oversight, and other rules and regulations to which we are subject. Those providers, because they are not so highly regulated, may have a competitive advantage over us and may continue to draw large amounts of funds away from traditional banking institutions, with a continuing adverse effect on the banking industry in general.
Future Legislation and Regulatory Reform
In light of current economic conditions, regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of financial institutions. From time to time, various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in Congress and state legislatures. New regulations and statutes are regularly proposed that contain wide-ranging proposals for altering the structures, regulations and competitive relationships of financial institutions operating in the United States. We cannot 
17

predict whether or in what form any proposed regulation or statute will be adopted or the extent to which our business may be affected by any new regulation or statute. Future legislation, regulation and policies, and the effects of that legislation and regulation and those policies, may have a significant influence on our operations and activities, financial condition, results of operations, growth plans or future prospects and the overall growth and distribution of loans, investments and deposits. Such legislation, regulation and policies have had a significant effect on the operations and activities, financial condition, results of operations, growth plans and future prospects of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so.
