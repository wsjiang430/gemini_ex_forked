Item 1 — Business
General
Clearway Energy, Inc. (formerly NRG Yield, Inc.), together with its consolidated subsidiaries, or the Company, is a publicly-traded energy infrastructure investor in and owner of modern, sustainable and long-term contracted assets across North America. On August 31, 2018, NRG Energy, Inc., or NRG, transferred its full ownership interest in the Company to Clearway Energy Group LLC, or CEG, which is also the holder of NRG's renewable energy development and operations platform, and NRG subsequently sold 100% of its interest in CEG to an affiliate of GIP, such transaction referred to hereinafter as the GIP Transaction. As a result of the GIP Transaction, GIP indirectly acquired a 45.2% economic interest in Clearway Energy LLC (formerly NRG Yield LLC) and a 55.0% voting interest in the Company. Global Infrastructure Management, LLC is an independent fund manager of funds that invests in infrastructure assets in the energy and transport sectors, and Global Infrastructure Partners III is its third equity fund. The Company is sponsored by GIP through GIP's portfolio company, CEG.
The Company’s environmentally sound asset portfolio includes over 5,272 MW of wind, solar and natural gas-fired power generation facilities, as well as district energy systems. Through this diversified and contracted portfolio, the Company endeavors to provide its investors with stable and growing dividend income. The weighted average remaining contract duration of these offtake agreements, based on CAFD, was approximately 15 years as of December 31, 2018. The Company also owns thermal infrastructure assets with an aggregate steam and chilled water capacity of 1,385 net MWt and electric generation capacity of 133 net MW. These thermal infrastructure assets provide steam, hot and/or chilled water, and, in some instances, electricity to commercial businesses, universities, hospitals and governmental units in multiple locations, principally through long-term contracts or pursuant to rates regulated by state utility commissions.
A complete listing of the Company's interests in facilities, operations and/or projects owned or leased as of December 31, 2018 can be found in Item 2 — Properties.
Pacific Gas and Electric Company Bankruptcy
On January 29, 2019, Pacific Gas and Electric Company, or PG&E, filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California, or the Bankruptcy Court.  Certain subsidiaries of the Company, which hold interests in 6 solar facilities totaling 480 MW and Marsh Landing with capacity of 720 MW, sell the output of their facilities to PG&E under long-term power purchase agreements, or PPAs.  The Company consolidates three of the solar facilities and Marsh Landing, and records its interest in the other solar facilities as equity method investments. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had $1.5 billion of property, plant and equipment, net, $352 million investments in unconsolidated affiliates and $1.4 billion of long - term debt related to these facilities. The related subsidiaries of the Company have entered into financing agreements consisting of non-recourse project level debt and, in certain cases, non-recourse holding company debt. The PG&E Bankruptcy filing has triggered defaults under the PPAs with PG&E and such related financing agreements. The Company is currently negotiating forbearance agreements with the lenders for each respective financing arrangement.  The Company continues to assess the potential future impacts of the PG&E Bankruptcy as events occur, however, no impact to the Company’s immediate operating activities has occurred as of December 31, 2018.  
History
The Company was formed by NRG as a Delaware corporation on December 20, 2012. As of August 31, 2018, NRG, through its holdings of Class B common stock and Class D common stock, had a 55.0% voting interest in the Company and received distributions from NRG Yield LLC (now Clearway Energy LLC) through its ownership of Class B units and Class D units. The holders of the Company's issued and outstanding shares of Class A common stock and Class C common stock were entitled to dividends as declared and had 45.0% of the voting power in the Company. As noted above, on August 31, 2018, as the result of the GIP Transaction, GIP indirectly acquired a 45.2% economic interest in Clearway Energy LLC and a 55.0% voting interest in the Company. 
The Company is the sole managing member of Clearway Energy LLC and operates and controls all of its business and affairs and consolidates the financial results of Clearway Energy LLC and its subsidiaries. Clearway Energy LLC is a holding company for the companies that directly and indirectly own and operate the Company's assets. As of December 31, 2018, the Company and CEG have 55.8% and 44.2% economic interests in Clearway Energy LLC, respectively. As a result of the current ownership of the Class B common stock and Class D common stock, CEG controls the Company, and the Company in turn, as the sole managing member of Clearway Energy LLC, controls Clearway Energy LLC and its subsidiaries.

The diagram below depicts the Company’s organizational structure as of December 31, 2018:

Strategic Sponsorship with Global Infrastructure Partners
As described above, on August 31, 2018, NRG transferred its full ownership interest in the Company to Clearway Energy Group LLC, or CEG, the holder of NRG's renewable energy development and operations platform and subsequently sold 100% of its interest in CEG to an affiliate of GIP. As a result of the GIP Transaction, GIP indirectly acquired a 45.2% economic interest in Clearway Energy LLC and a 55.0% voting interest in the Company as of August 31, 2018.
In connection with the GIP Transaction, the Company entered into a Consent and Indemnity Agreement with NRG and GIP setting forth key terms and conditions of the Company's consent to the GIP Transaction. 
Also in connection with the GIP Transaction, the Company entered into the following agreements on August 31, 2018:
CEG Master Services Agreements
The Company, along with Clearway Energy LLC and Clearway Energy Operating LLC, entered into Master Services Agreements with CEG, pursuant to which CEG and certain of its affiliates or third party service providers began providing certain services to the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, and the Company and certain of its subsidiaries began providing certain services to CEG, in exchange for the payment of fees in respect of such services. Additional details regarding the Master Services Agreements are found in Item 15 — Note 15, Related Party Transactions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
ROFO Agreements
The Company entered into a ROFO Agreement with CEG, or the CEG ROFO Agreement, and a Third Amended and Restated ROFO Agreement with NRG as further discussed below. 
 8

Voting and Governance Agreement
The Company entered into a Voting and Governance Agreement with CEG relating to certain governance matters of the Company, including the composition of the board of directors of the Company, or the Board, implementation of a stockholder proposal at the next annual meeting of the Company to amend the restated certificate of incorporation of the Company to stagger the Board, and the employment status of the CEO of the Company. 
Limited Liability Company Agreement
The Company entered into the Fourth Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Clearway Energy LLC with CEG, which sets forth the rights and obligations of the Company, as managing member, and CEG, as member, of Clearway Energy LLC. 
Transition Services Agreement
The Company entered into the NRG TSA, pursuant to which NRG or certain of its affiliates began providing transition services to the Company following the consummation of the GIP Transaction, in exchange for the payment of a fee in respect of such services. The agreement is effective until the earlier of June 30, 2019 or the date that all services are terminated by the Company. The Company may extend the term on a month-by-month basis no later than March 31, 2020 for a fixed monthly fee provided for in the agreement.
Business Strategy
The Company's primary business strategy is to focus on the acquisition and ownership of assets with predictable, long-term cash flows in order that it may be able to increase the cash dividends paid to holders of the Company's Class A and Class C common stock over time without compromising the ongoing stability of the business. As discussed above, the PG&E Bankruptcy has caused uncertainty around the timing of when certain project-level distributions will be available to the Company. As a result of such timing uncertainty, the Company reduced its quarterly dividend for the first quarter of 2019 to $0.20 per share of Class A and Class C common stock, compared to $0.331 per share in the prior quarter. While the Company views this action as prudent from a financial perspective, it has not changed the Company's long-term business strategy.
The Company's plan for executing its business strategy includes the following key components:
Focus on contracted renewable energy and conventional generation and thermal infrastructure assets. The Company owns and operates utility scale and distributed renewable energy and natural gas-fired generation, thermal and other infrastructure assets with proven technologies, low operating risks and stable cash flows. The Company believes by focusing on this core asset class and leveraging its industry knowledge, it will maximize its strategic opportunities, be a leader in operational efficiency and maximize its overall financial performance.
Growing the business through acquisitions of contracted operating assets.  The Company believes that its base of operations provides a platform in the conventional and renewable power generation and thermal sectors for strategic growth through cash accretive and tax advantaged acquisitions complementary to its existing portfolio. In addition to acquiring renewable generation, conventional generation and thermal infrastructure assets from third parties where the Company believes its knowledge of the market and operating expertise provides it with a competitive advantage, the Company entered into the CEG ROFO Agreement. Under the CEG ROFO Agreement, CEG has granted the Company and its affiliates a right of first offer on any proposed sale, transfer or other disposition of certain assets of CEG, or the CEG ROFO Assets, until August 31, 2023. CEG is not obligated to sell the remaining CEG ROFO Assets to the Company and, if offered by CEG, the Company cannot be sure whether these assets will be offered on acceptable terms, or that the Company will choose to consummate such acquisitions. The assets listed below represent the Company's currently committed investments and the CEG ROFO Assets:

(a) On August 31, 2018, Clearway Energy Operating LLC and Clearway Energy Group executed a purchase agreement pursuant to which the Company will acquire effective equity ownership in 80 MW of utility-scale solar projects (Waipao, Mililani II and Kawailoa Solar) located in Oahu, Hawaii. 
(b) On December 26, 2018, the Company and CEG amended the DGPV Holdco 3 partnership agreement to increase the capital commitment of $50 million to $70 million. 
(c)  Investment in the Repowering Partnership with CEG is contingent upon obtaining related construction and tax equity financing.
(d) The Company maintains the option to purchase Carlsbad from GIP at any time within 18 months after February 27, 2019 at the same economic terms at which it originally agreed to purchase the asset from NRG. Should the Company not acquire Carlsbad within such 18 months, Carlsbad will become a CEG ROFO Asset.
 The NRG ROFO Agreement was amended upon the closing of the GIP Transaction to (i) remove the Ivanpah solar facility and (ii) provide the Company and its subsidiaries a right of first offer on any proposed sale or transfer of 100% of the membership interest in Agua Caliente Borrower 1, LLC, which owns a 35% interest in Agua Caliente, a 290 MW utility-scale solar project located in Dateland, Arizona with PG&E as the project’s customer. Pursuant to the terms of the NRG ROFO Agreement, the Company elected to forgo the acquisition. The Company continues to own a 16% interest in the project through Agua Caliente Borrower 2 LLC.
The Company entered into an agreement with NRG to purchase the Carlsbad project on February 6, 2018. The Company elected to exercise the Carlsbad backstop facility provided by GIP; as such, GIP purchased 100% of the membership interest in Carlsbad Energy Holdings LLC on February 27, 2019. 
Additionally, the CEG ROFO Agreement was amended on February 14, 2019, to grant to the Company a right of first offer for Hawaii Solar Phase II, which consist of Mililani I and Waiawa solar and storage projects located in Oahu, Hawaii. The projects are expected to reach COD in 2021.
Primary focus on North America. The Company intends to primarily focus its investments in North America (including the unincorporated territories of the U.S.). The Company believes that industry fundamentals in North America present it with significant opportunity to acquire renewable, natural gas-fired generation and thermal infrastructure assets, without creating significant exposure to currency and sovereign risk. By primarily focusing its efforts on North America, the Company believes it will best leverage its regional knowledge of power markets, industry relationships and skill sets to maximize the performance of the Company.
Maintain sound financial practices to grow the dividend. The Company intends to maintain a commitment to disciplined financial analysis and a balanced capital structure to enable it to increase its quarterly dividend over time and serve the long-term interests of its stockholders. The Company's financial practices include a risk and credit policy focused on transacting with credit-worthy counterparties; a financing policy, which focuses on seeking an optimal capital structure through various capital formation alternatives to minimize interest rate and refinancing risks, ensure stable long-term dividends and maximize value; and a dividend policy that is based on distributing a significant portion of CAFD each quarter that the Company receives from Clearway Energy LLC, subject to available capital, market conditions, and compliance with associated laws, regulations and other contractual obligations. The Company intends to evaluate various alternatives for financing future acquisitions and refinancing of existing project-level debt, in each case, to reduce the cost of debt, extend maturities and maximize CAFD. The Company believes it has 
 10

additional flexibility to seek alternative financing arrangements, including, but not limited to, debt financings and equity-like instruments.
Competition
Power generation is a capital-intensive business with numerous and diverse industry participants. The Company competes on the basis of the location of its plants and on the basis of contract price and terms of individual projects. Within the power industry, there is a wide variation in terms of the capabilities, resources, nature and identity of the companies with whom the Company competes with depending on the market. Competitors for energy supply are utilities, independent power producers and other providers of distributed generation. The Company also competes to acquire new projects with renewable developers who retain renewable power plant ownership, independent power producers, financial investors and other dividend, growth-oriented companies. Competitive conditions may be substantially affected by capital market conditions and by various forms of energy legislation and regulation considered by federal, state and local legislatures and administrative agencies, including tax policy. Such laws and regulations may substantially increase the costs of acquiring, constructing and operating projects, and it could be difficult for the Company to adapt to and operate under such laws and regulations.
The Company's thermal business has certain cost efficiencies that may form barriers to entry. Generally, there is only one district energy system in a given territory, for which the only competition comes from on-site systems. While the district energy system can usually make an effective case for the efficiency of its services, some building owners nonetheless may opt for on-site systems, either due to corporate policies regarding allocation of capital, unique situations where an on-site system might in fact prove more efficient, or because of previously committed capital in systems that are already on-site. Growth in existing district energy systems generally comes from new building construction or existing building conversions within the service territory of the district energy provider.
Competitive Strengths
Stable, high quality cash flows. The Company's facilities have a stable, predictable cash flow profile consisting of predominantly long-life electric generation assets that sell electricity under long-term fixed priced contracts or pursuant to regulated rates with investment grade and certain other credit-worthy counterparties. As discussed above, PG&E, one of the Company's significant customers, filed for bankruptcy on January 29, 2019. Additionally, the Company's facilities have minimal fuel risk. For the Company's conventional assets, fuel is provided by the toll counterparty or the cost thereof is a pass-through cost under the Contract for Differences, or CfD. Renewable facilities have no fuel costs, and most of the Company's thermal infrastructure assets have contractual or regulatory tariff mechanisms for fuel cost recovery. The offtake agreements for the Company's conventional and renewable generation facilities have a weighted-average remaining duration, based on CAFD, of approximately 15 years as of December 31, 2018, providing long-term cash flow stability. The Company's generation offtake agreements with counterparties for whom credit ratings are available have a weighted-average Moody’s rating of Ba1 (post PG&E Bankruptcy) based on rated capacity under contract. All of the Company's assets are in the U.S. and accordingly have no currency or repatriation risks. 
High quality, long-lived assets with low operating and capital requirements.  The Company benefits from a portfolio of relatively younger assets, other than thermal infrastructure assets. The Company's assets are comprised of proven and reliable technologies, provided by leading original solar and wind equipment manufacturers such as General Electric, Siemens AG, SunPower Corporation, or SunPower, First Solar Inc., or First Solar, Vestas, Suzlon and Mitsubishi. Given the modern nature of the portfolio, which includes a substantial number of relatively low operating and maintenance cost solar and wind generation assets, the Company expects to achieve high fleet availability and expend modest maintenance-related capital expenditures. 
Significant scale and diversity. The Company owns and operates a large and diverse portfolio of contracted electric generation and thermal infrastructure assets. As of December 31, 2018, the Company's 5,272 net MW contracted generation portfolio benefits from significant diversification in terms of technology, fuel type, counterparty and geography. The Company's thermal business consists of thirteen operations, seven of which are district energy centers that provide steam and chilled water to approximately 695 customers, and six of which provide generation. The Company believes its scale and access to best practices across the fleet improves its business development opportunities through enhanced industry relationships, reputation and understanding of regional power market dynamics. Furthermore, the Company's diversification reduces its operating risk profile and reliance on any single market.
 11

Relationship with GIP and CEG. The Company believes that its relationship with GIP and CEG provides significant benefits. Global Infrastructure Management, LLC, or GIM, the manager of GIP, is an independent infrastructure fund manager with over $51 billion in assets under management (as of September 30, 2018) that invests in infrastructure assets and businesses in both OECD and select emerging market countries. GIM has a strong track record of investment and value creation in the renewable energy sector. GIM also has extensive experience with publicly traded yield vehicles and development platforms, ranging from Europe's first application of a yield company/development company model to the largest renewable platform in Asia-Pacific. Additionally, the Company believes that CEG provides the Company access to a highly capable renewable development and operations platform that is aligned to support the Company's growth. 
Environmentally well-positioned portfolio of assets. The Company's portfolio of electric generation assets consists of 3,327 net MW of renewable generation capacity that are non-emitting sources of power generation. The Company's conventional assets consist of the dual fuel-fired GenConn assets as well as the Marsh Landing and Walnut Creek simple cycle natural gas-fired peaking generation facilities and the El Segundo combined cycle natural gas-fired peaking facility. The Company does not anticipate having to expend any significant capital expenditures in the foreseeable future to comply with current environmental regulations applicable to its generation assets. Taken as a whole, the Company believes its strategy will be a net beneficiary of current and potential environmental legislation and regulatory requirements that may serve as a catalyst for capacity retirements and improve market opportunities for environmentally well-positioned assets like the Company's assets once its current offtake agreements expire.
Thermal infrastructure business has high entry costs. Significant capital has been invested to construct the Company's thermal infrastructure assets, serving as a barrier to entry in the markets in which such assets operate. As of December 31, 2018, the Company's thermal gross property, plant, and equipment was approximately $583 million. The Company's thermal district energy centers are located in urban city areas, with the chilled water and steam delivery systems located underground. Constructing underground delivery systems in urban areas requires long lead times for permitting, rights of way and inspections and is costly. By contrast, the incremental cost to add new customers in existing markets is relatively low. Once thermal infrastructure is established, the Company believes it has the ability to retain customers over long periods of time and to compete effectively for additional business against stand-alone on-site heating and cooling generation facilities. Installation of stand-alone equipment can require significant modification to a building as well as significant space for equipment and funding for capital expenditures. The Company's system technologies often provide economies of scale in terms of fuel procurement, ability to switch between multiple types of fuel to generate thermal energy, and fuel conversion efficiency. 
Segment Review
The following tables summarize the Company's operating revenues, net income (loss) and assets by segment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, as discussed in Item 15 — Note 13, Segment Reporting, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. All amounts have been recast to include the effect of the acquisitions of the Drop Down Assets, which were accounted for as transfers of entities under common control. The accounting guidance requires retrospective combination of the entities for all periods presented as if the combination has been in effect since the inception of common control. Accordingly, the Company prepared its consolidated financial statements to reflect the transfers as if they had taken place from the beginning of the financial statements period or from the date the entities were under common control (if later than the beginning of the financial statements period).

Policy Incentives
Policy incentives in the U.S. have the effect of making the development of renewable energy projects more competitive by providing credits and other tax benefits for a portion of the development costs. A loss of or reduction in such incentives could decrease the attractiveness of renewable energy projects to developers, including CEG, which could reduce the Company's future acquisition opportunities. Such a loss or reduction could also reduce the Company's willingness to pursue or develop certain renewable energy projects due to higher operating costs or decreased revenues under its PPAs.
U.S. federal, state and local governments have established various incentives to support the development of renewable energy projects. These incentives include accelerated tax depreciation, PTCs, ITCs, cash grants, tax abatements and RPS programs. Pursuant to the U.S. federal Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System, or MACRS, wind and solar projects are fully depreciated for tax purposes over a five-year period even though the useful life of such projects is generally much longer than five years. The Tax Act also provides the ability for wind and solar projects to claim immediate expensing for property acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017, and before January 1, 2023.
Owners of utility-scale wind facilities are eligible to claim an income tax credit (the PTC, or an ITC in lieu of the PTC) upon initially achieving commercial operation. The PTC is determined based on the amount of electricity produced by the wind facility during the first ten years of commercial operation. This incentive was created under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and has been extended several times. Alternatively, an ITC equal to 30% of the cost of a wind facility may be claimed in lieu of the PTC. In order to qualify for the PTC (or ITC in lieu of the PTC), construction of a wind facility must begin before a specified date and the taxpayer must maintain a continuous program of construction or continuous efforts to advance the project to completion. The Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, issued guidance stating that the safe harbor for continuous efforts and continuous construction requirements will generally be satisfied if the facility is placed in service no more than four years after the year in which construction of the facility began. The IRS also confirmed that retrofitted wind facilities may re-qualify for PTCs or ITCs pursuant the begin construction requirement, as long as the cost basis of the new investment is at least 80% of the facility’s total fair value. 
Owners of solar projects are eligible to claim a 30% ITC for new solar projects, or could have elected to receive an equivalent cash payment from the U.S. Department of Treasury for the value of the 30% ITC for qualifying solar projects where construction began before the end of 2011 and the projects were placed in service before 2017. Tax credits for qualifying wind and solar projects are subject to the following phase-down schedule.

 | Year construction of project begins
 | 2015 | | 2016 | | 2017 | 2018 | | 2019 | | 2020 | 2021 | | 2022
PTC(a) | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 80 | % | | 60 | % | 40 | % | | 0 | | 0 | | 0 | 
Wind ITC | 30 | % | | 30 | % | 24 | % | | 18 | % | 12 | % | | 0 | | 0 | | 0 | 
Solar ITC(b) | 30 | % | | 30 | % | 30 | % | | 30 | % | 30 | % | | 26 | % | 22 | % | 10 | %

(a) Percentage of the full PTC available for wind projects that begin construction during the applicable year.
(b) ITC is limited to 10% for projects not placed in service before January 1, 2024.
RPS, currently in place in certain states and territories, require electricity providers in the state or territory to meet a certain percentage of their retail sales with energy from renewable sources. Additionally, other states in the U.S. have set renewable energy goals to reduce GHG emissions from historic levels. The Company believes that these standards and goals will create incremental demand for renewable energy in the future.

Regulatory Matters 
As owners of power plants and participants in wholesale and thermal energy markets, certain of the Company's subsidiaries are subject to regulation by various federal and state government agencies. These agencies include FERC and the PUCT, as well as other public utility commissions in certain states where the Company's assets are located. Each of the Company's U.S. generating facilities qualifies as an EWG or QF. In addition, the Company is subject to the market rules, procedures and protocols of the various ISO and RTO markets in which it participates. Likewise, certain of the Company's subsidiaries must also comply with the mandatory reliability requirements imposed by NERC and the regional reliability entities in the regions where the Company has generating facilities subject to NERC's reliability authority. The Company's operations within the ERCOT footprint are not subject to rate regulation by FERC, as they are deemed to operate solely within the ERCOT market and not in interstate commerce. These operations are subject to regulation by PUCT.
FERC
FERC, among other things, regulates the transmission and the wholesale sale of electricity in interstate commerce under the authority of the FPA. The transmission of electric energy occurring wholly within ERCOT is not subject to FERC’s jurisdiction. Under existing regulations, FERC determines whether an entity owning a generation facility is an EWG, as defined in the PUHCA. FERC also determines whether a generation facility meets the applicable criteria of a QF under the PURPA. Each of the Company’s generating facilities qualifies as either an EWG or QF.
The FPA gives FERC exclusive rate-making jurisdiction over the wholesale sale of electricity and transmission of electricity in interstate commerce of public utilities (as defined by the FPA). Under the FPA, FERC, with certain exceptions, regulates owners and operators of facilities used for the wholesale sale of electricity or transmission in interstate commerce as public utilities, and is charged with ensuring that market rules that are just and reasonable.
Public utilities are required to obtain FERC’s acceptance, pursuant to Section 205 of the FPA, of their rate schedules for the wholesale sale of electricity. All of the Company’s non-QF generating entities located outside of ERCOT make sales of electricity pursuant to market-based rates, as opposed to traditional cost-of-service regulated rates. FERC will conduct a review of the market based rates of Company public utilities and potential market power every three years according to a regional schedule established by FERC.
In accordance with the Energy Policy Act of 2005, FERC has approved the NERC as the national Energy Reliability Organization, or ERO. As the ERO, NERC is responsible for the development and enforcement of mandatory reliability standards for the wholesale electric power system. In addition to complying with NERC requirements, each entity must comply with the requirements of the regional reliability entity for the region in which it is located.
The PURPA was passed in 1978 in large part to promote increased energy efficiency and development of independent power producers. The PURPA created QFs to further both goals, and FERC is primarily charged with administering the PURPA as it applies to QFs. Certain QFs are exempt from regulation, either in whole or in part, under the FPA.
The PUHCA provides FERC with certain authority over and access to books and records of public utility holding companies not otherwise exempt by virtue of their ownership of EWGs, QFs, and Foreign Utility Companies. The Company is exempt from many of the accounting, record retention, and reporting requirements of the PUHCA.

Environmental Matters 
The Company is subject to a wide range of environmental laws in the development, construction, ownership and operation of projects. These laws generally require that governmental permits and approvals be obtained before construction and during operation of facilities. The Company is also subject to laws regarding the protection of wildlife, including migratory birds, eagles, threatened and endangered species. Federal and state environmental laws have historically become more stringent over time, although this trend could change in the future.
In October 2015, the EPA finalized the Clean Power Plan, or CPP, addressing GHG emissions from existing EGUs. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the CPP. The D.C. Circuit heard oral argument on the legal challenges to the CPP in September 2016. At the EPA's request, the D.C. Circuit agreed on April 28, 2017 to hold the case in abeyance. On October 16, 2017, the EPA proposed a rule to repeal the CPP. Accordingly, the Company believes the CPP is not likely to survive. In August 21, 2018, the EPA proposed the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule which would establish emission guidelines for states to develop plans to address greenhouse gas emissions from existing coal-fired power plants. The ACE rule would replace the 2015 Clean Power Plan. A public hearing on the proposed ACE rule was held on October 1, 2018. As currently written, the ACE focuses on reducing emissions from existing coal-fired power plants and therefore, would not be applicable to the Company’s EGUs.
Migratory Bird Treaty Act
During the 2018 California legislative sessions AB 2627 (Kalra), a bill designed to backstop the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, or MBTA, interpretation by the Obama Administration was introduced. AB 2627 provided legislative confirmation of the illegality of take of any MBTA species, unless the entity deployed Best Management Practices that had been approved by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, or CDFW. The bill was pulled by the author at the end of session. However, on November 30, 2018, CDFW issued a legal advisory declaring that the state can still prohibit the unintentional killing of migratory birds even if the Department of the Interior says the federal government cannot.
