Item 1. Business
 
ANI Pharmaceuticals is an integrated specialty pharmaceutical company focused on delivering value to our customers by developing, manufacturing, and marketing high quality branded and generic prescription pharmaceuticals. We focus on niche and high barrier to entry opportunities including controlled substances, anti-cancer (oncolytics), hormones and steroids, and complex formulations. Our three pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities, of which two are located in Baudette, Minnesota and one is located in Oakville, Ontario, are together capable of producing oral solid dose products, as well as semi-solids, liquids and topicals, controlled substances, and potent products that must be manufactured in a fully-contained environment. Our strategy is to use our assets to develop, acquire, manufacture, and market branded and generic specialty prescription pharmaceuticals. By executing this strategy, we believe we will be able to continue to grow our business, expand and diversify our product portfolio, and create long-term value for our investors.
 
On June 19, 2013, pursuant to a merger agreement dated as of April 12, 2013, ANIP Acquisition Company d/b/a ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("ANIP") became a wholly-owned subsidiary of BioSante Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“BioSante”) in an all-stock, tax-free reorganization (the "Merger"). The Merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition, pursuant to which ANIP was considered the acquiring entity for accounting purposes. Since the Merger, we have been operating under the leadership of the ANIP management team and ANIP's historical results of operations have replaced BioSante's historical results of operations for all periods prior to the Merger. The results of operations of both companies are included in our consolidated financial statements for all periods after completion of the Merger. In July 2013, we changed our name from “BioSante Pharmaceuticals, Inc.” to “ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc.”
 
In March 2014, we completed a follow-on public offering of common stock, yielding net proceeds of $46.7 million. In December 2014, we issued $143.8 million of our Convertible Senior Notes (the “Notes”) in a registered public offering, yielding net proceeds of $122.6 million. In December 2018, we repurchased $25.0 million of our outstanding Notes. At the same time, we unwound a corresponding portion of the bond hedge and warrant. In December 2017, we entered into a five-year senior secured credit facility (the “Credit Agreement”) with Citizens Bank N.A. The Credit Agreement is comprised of a $75.0 million five-year secured term loan (the “Term Loan”) and a $50.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). In December 2018, we refinanced our $125.0 million Credit Agreement by entering into an amended and restated Senior Secured Credit Facility (the “Credit Facility”) for up to $265.2 million. The principal new feature of the Credit Facility is a $118.0 million Delayed Draw Term Loan (the “DDTL”), which can only be drawn on in order to pay down the Company’s remaining 3.0% Convertible Senior Notes, which will mature in December 2019. The Credit Facility also extended the maturity of the $72.2 million secured term loan balance to December 2023. In addition, the Credit Facility increased the previous $50.0 million line of credit (the “Revolver”) to $75.0 million. As of December 31, 2018, we had not drawn on the Revolver or DDTL.
 
With the additional funds resulting from the public and convertible debt offerings, and from the Credit Agreement, we have acquired Abbreviate New Drug Applications (“ANDAs”), New Drug Applications (“NDAs”), and product rights, and have also entered into agreements to obtain the distribution rights for various products. As a result of these acquisitions and distribution agreements, we launched three products in 2014, six products in 2015, 11 products in 2016, six products in 2017, and 11 products in 2018, bringing our portfolio of products to 42 as of December 31, 2018. In addition, in January 2016, we acquired the Cortrophin gel and Cortrophin-Zinc NDAs. We have continued to focus on the re-commercialization of these products while increasing our portfolio of generic and mature brand products.
 
On August 6, 2018, our subsidiary, ANI Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc. (“ANI Canada”), acquired all the issued and outstanding equity interests of WellSpring Pharma Services Inc. (“WellSpring”), a Canadian company that performs contract development and manufacturing of pharmaceutical products for a purchase price of $18.0 million, subject to certain customary adjustments. Pursuant to these customary adjustments, the total purchase consideration was $16.7 million. The consideration was paid entirely from cash on hand. In conjunction with the transaction, we acquired WellSpring’s pharmaceutical manufacturing facility, laboratory, and offices, its current book of commercial business, as well as an organized workforce. Following the consummation of the transaction, WellSpring was merged into ANI Canada with the resulting entity’s name being ANI Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc.
 
Unless otherwise required by the context, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to the "Company," "we," us," and "our" refer to ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation formed in April 2001. Our principal executive offices are located at 210 Main Street West, Baudette, Minnesota, 56623, our telephone number is (218) 634-3500, and our website address is www.anipharmaceuticals.com.

Mission and Strategy 
 
We are an integrated specialty pharmaceutical company focused on delivering value to our customers by developing, manufacturing, and marketing high quality branded and generic prescription pharmaceuticals. We focus on niche and high barrier to entry opportunities including controlled substances, anti-cancer (oncolytics), hormones and steroids, and complex formulations. At our three facilities, of which two are located in Baudette, Minnesota and one is located in Oakville, Ontario, we manufacture oral solid dose products, as well as semi-solids, liquids and topicals, controlled substances, and potent products that must be manufactured in a fully-contained environment. We also perform contract manufacturing for other pharmaceutical companies.
 
In addition to laboratories that support the requirements of raw material, finished product, and stability testing, we have a 1,000-square foot pilot laboratory offering liquid, suspension and solid dose development capabilities. This pilot laboratory offers a full range of analytical capabilities including method development, validation and de-formulation, and is licensed by the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”). Finally, a separate development suite located within our high-potency manufacturing facility offers additional capabilities for product development.
 
Our objective is to create long term shareholder value by building a sustainable and growing base business in generic and mature brand pharmaceutical products while advancing an opportunity to re-commercialize Cortrophin gel and Cortrophin-Zinc.
 
We believe our strategies effectively leverage our human and capital assets and will result in measurable growth of our business. Since 2014, we have successfully:
 

· | Increased prescription product sales through a combination of market share gains on existing products and new product launches.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Acquired the NDAs for and began marketing Atacand, Atacand HCT, Arimidex, Casodex, Lithobid, Vancocin, Inderal LA, Inderal XL, and InnoPran XL.

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe that our cash resources and forecasted cash flows from operations will be sufficient to enable us to meet our operational needs for the foreseeable future.
 
Product Development Considerations 
 
We consider a variety of criteria in determining which products to develop or acquire, all of which relate to the level of potential competition and expected profitability upon product launch. These criteria include:

· | Formulation Complexity. Our development and manufacturing capabilities enable us to manufacture pharmaceuticals that are difficult to produce, including highly potent, extended release, combination, and low dosage products. This ability to manufacture a variety of complex products is a competitive strength that we intend to leverage in selecting products to develop or manufacture.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Patent Status. We seek to develop products whose branded bioequivalents do not have long-term patent protection or existing patent challenges. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Market Size. When determining whether to develop or acquire an individual product, we review the current and expected market size for that product at launch, as well as forecasted price erosion upon conversion from branded to generic pricing. We endeavor to manufacture products with sufficient market size to enable us to enter the market with a strong likelihood of being able to price our products both competitively and at a profit. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-


· | Profit Potential. We research the availability and cost of active pharmaceutical ingredients in determining which products to develop or acquire. In determining the potential profit of a product, we forecast our anticipated market share, pricing, including the expected price erosion caused by competition from other generic manufacturers, and the estimated cost to manufacture the products.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Manufacturing. We generally seek to develop and manufacture products at our own manufacturing plants in order to optimize the utilization of our facilities, ensure quality control in our products, and maximize profit potential. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Competition. When determining whether to develop or acquire a product, we research existing and expected competition. We seek to develop products for which we can obtain sufficient market share, and may decline to develop a product if we anticipate significant competition. Our specialized manufacturing facilities provide a means of entering niche markets, such as hormone therapies, in which fewer generic companies are able to compete.

The capsules are not effective for other types of infections, as the drugs are not systematically absorbed.
 
Markets
 
In determining which products to pursue for development, we target products that are complex to manufacture and therefore have higher barriers to entry. These factors provide opportunities for growth, utilizing our competitive strengths at the same time that they decrease the number of potential competitors in the markets for these products. These markets currently include controlled substances, oncolytics, hormones and steroids, and complex formulations, including extended release and combination products.
Controlled Substances
 
One of our manufacturing facilities in Baudette, Minnesota is licensed by the DEA for the manufacture of Schedule II controlled substances. Our manufacturing facility in Oakville, Ontario is licensed by Health Canada for the manufacture of Schedule II controlled substances. Controlled substances are drugs considered to have a high abuse risk but that also have safe and accepted medical uses. In addition to our five Schedule II products currently on the market, our pipeline includes one ANDA in this market.

7
-

Oncolytics 
 
Due to the capabilities of our containment facility and our expertise in manufacturing segregation, we are focused on developing and manufacturing niche oncolytic (anti-cancer) drugs. In particular, we are targeting products subject to priority review by the FDA, more specifically those with no blocking patents and no generic competition. We currently have three oncolytic products on the market.
Hormone and Steroid Drugs
 
The market for hormone and steroid drugs includes hormone therapy to alleviate menopausal symptoms in women, contraceptives, testosterone replacement therapies for men, and therapies for treating hormone-sensitive cancers. 
 
Hormone Therapy (“HT”) has been an accepted medical treatment for alleviating the symptoms of menopause since the 1930s, with formal FDA approval for that use granted in 1942. Initially, HT consisted of estrogen only, but has evolved to include combination therapies of estrogen, progesterone, and androgens. We target niche products in the HT and steroid product market for several reasons, including:
 

· | Hormone and steroid products are a core competency based on our manufacturing and product development teams' long history of manufacturing these types of products; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The aging baby boom population, of which women represent a majority, is expected to support continued growth in the HT market.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Complex Formulations 
 
Our manufacturing facilities can be used to manufacture complex formulations, including, but not limited to, extended release and combination products, which have higher barriers to entry and, therefore, fewer competitors. In addition to our 11 complex formulation products currently on the market, our pipeline includes eight extended-release products and five combination products.

Contract Manufacturing 
 
We manufacture pharmaceutical products for several branded and generic companies, who outsource production in order to:
 

· | Free-up internal resources to focus on sales and marketing as well as research and development;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Employ internal capacity to manufacture higher volume or more critical products; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Utilize our specialized equipment and expertise.
--+-------------------------------------------------

 
Given our specialized manufacturing capabilities, we are focused on attracting niche contract manufacturing opportunities that offer high margins.
 
On August 6, 2018, we acquired all the issued and outstanding equity interests of WellSpring Pharma Services Inc., a Canadian company that performs contract development and manufacturing of pharmaceutical products. In conjunction with the transaction, we acquired WellSpring’s pharmaceutical manufacturing facility, laboratory, and offices, its current book of contract manufacturing business, as well as an organized workforce. As a result of this transaction, we perform contract manufacturing in both our Baudette, Minnesota and Oakville, Ontario facilities.
 
Manufacturing, Suppliers, and Raw Materials 
 
We require a supply of quality raw materials, including active pharmaceutical ingredients (“API”), and components to manufacture and package our pharmaceutical products. In order to manufacture Morphine Sulfate oral solution, Opium Tincture, Oxycodone Hydrochloride oral solution (5 mg/5 mL), Oxycodone Hydrochloride oral solution (100 mg/5 mL), and Oxycodone Hydrochloride capsules, we must submit a request to the DEA for a quota to purchase the amount of morphine sulfate, opium, and oxycodone hydrochloride needed to manufacture the respective products. Without approved quotas from the DEA, we would not be able to purchase these ingredients from our suppliers.
 
We source the raw materials for our products from both domestic and international suppliers, which we carefully select. Generally, we qualify only a single source of API for use in each product due to the cost and time required to validate and qualify a second source of supply. Any change in one of our API suppliers must usually be approved through a Prior Approval Supplement (“PAS”) by the FDA. The process of obtaining an approval of such a PAS can require between four and 18 months. While we also generally qualify a single source for non-API raw materials, the process required to qualify an alternative source of a non-API raw material is typically much less rigorous. If we were to change the supplier of a raw material for a product, the cost for the material could be greater than the amount we paid with the previous supplier. Changes in suppliers are rare, but could occur as a result of a supplier’s business failing, an issue arising from an FDA inspection, or failure to maintain our required standards of quality. As a result, we select suppliers with great care, based on various factors including quality, reliability of supply, and long-term financial stability. Certain of the APIs for our drug products, including those that are marketed without approved NDAs or ANDAs, such as EEMT, are sourced from international suppliers. From time to time, we have experienced temporary disruptions in the supply of certain of such imported API due to FDA inspections.
 
Government Regulation 
 
The pharmaceutical industry in the U.S. and Canada is highly regulated by multiple U.S. and Canadian government agencies, such as the FDA, the DEA, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), and Health Canada. As a result, we are subject to extensive and complex rules and regulations, which are subject to revision from time to time. While we have experience with these regulations, there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully comply with all applicable regulations.
Branded and Generic Pharmaceutical Products 
 
All prescription pharmaceutical products distributed in the U.S., whether branded or generic, must be approved by the FDA. All applications for FDA approval must contain information relating to product formulation, raw material suppliers, stability, manufacturing processes, packaging, labeling, and quality control. Information to support the bioequivalence of generic drug products or the safety and effectiveness of new drug products for their intended use is also required to be submitted. There are generally two types of applications used for obtaining FDA approval of new products:

9
-

New Drug Application (“NDA”)—An NDA is filed when approval is sought to market a newly developed branded product and, in certain instances, for a new dosage form, a new delivery system, or a new indication for an approved drug. We market Arimidex, Atacand, Atacand HCT, Casodex, Cortenema, generic Candesartan Hydrochlorothiazide, generic Fenofibrate, generic Fluvoxamine Maleate, generic Hydrocortisone Enema, generic Terbutaline Sulfate, Inderal LA, Inderal XL, InnoPran XL, generic Lithium Carbonate ER, Lithobid, generic Mesalamine, generic Propranolol ER, Reglan, Vancocin, and generic Vancomycin under approved NDAs.
Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”)—An ANDA is filed when approval is sought to market a generic equivalent of a drug approved under an NDA. We market Cholestyramine, Desipramine Hydrochloride, Diphenoxylate Hydrochloride and Atropine Sulfate, Erythromycin Ethylsuccinate, Etodolac, Ezetimibe-Simvastatin, Felbamate, Flecainide, Hydrocortisone rectal cream (1% and 2.5%), Indapamide, Methazolamide, Metoclopramide oral solution, Morphine Sulfate oral solution, Nilutamide, Nimodipine, Oxycodone Hydrochloride capsules, Oxycodone Hydrochloride oral solution (5 mg/5 mL), Oxycodone Hydrochloride oral solution (100 mg/5 mL), Pindolol, and Propafenone under approved ANDAs.
 
The ANDA development process is generally less time-consuming and less complex than the NDA development process. It typically does not require new preclinical and clinical studies, because it relies on the studies establishing safety and efficacy conducted for the branded drug approved through the NDA process. The ANDA process, however, typically requires one or more bioequivalence studies to show that the ANDA drug is bioequivalent to the previously approved reference listed drug (“RLD”).
 
The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the “Hatch-Waxman Act”) provides that generic drugs may enter the market after the approval of an ANDA, which requires (1) that bioequivalence to the branded product be demonstrated through clinical studies, and (2) either the expiration, invalidation or circumvention of any patents or the end of any other relevant market exclusivity periods related to the branded drug.
 
Accordingly, generic products generally provide a safe, effective, and cost-efficient alternative to users of branded products. Growth in the generic pharmaceutical industry has been driven by the increased market acceptance of generic drugs, as well as the number of branded drugs for which patent terms and/or other market exclusivities have expired.
 
Generic products are generally commercialized after the expiration of patent protection for the branded product and after the end of a period of non-patent market exclusivity. In addition to patent exclusivity, the holder of the NDA may be entitled to a period of non-patent market exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot approve an application for a generic product. Also, if the NDA is a new chemical entity (“NCE”), the FDA may not approve an ANDA for a generic product for up to five years following approval of the NDA for the NCE. If an NDA is not an NCE, but the holder of the NDA conducted clinical trials essential to approval of the NDA or a supplement thereto, the FDA may not approve a generic equivalent to the NDA for three years. Certain other periods of exclusivity may be available if the branded drug is indicated for treatment of a rare disease or is studied for pediatric indications.
 
In order to obtain FDA approval of NDAs and ANDAs, our manufacturing procedures and operations must conform to FDA requirements and guidelines, generally referred to as “cGMP.” The requirements for FDA approval encompass all aspects of the production process, including validation and recordkeeping, the standards around which are continuously changing and evolving. As a result, we must consistently monitor and comply with these changes.
 
Our facilities, procedures, operations, and testing of products are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA, the DEA, Health Canada, and other authorities. In addition, the FDA and Health Canada conduct pre-approval and post-approval reviews and plant inspections to determine whether our systems and processes are in compliance with cGMP and other FDA and Health Canada regulations. Our suppliers are subject to similar regulations and periodic inspections.
 

10
--

Controlled Substances 
 
The DEA regulates certain drug products containing controlled substances, pursuant to the U.S. Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”). Morphine Sulfate, which is a significant component of our Morphine Sulfate oral solution product, is classified as a controlled substance. Opium, which is a significant component of our Opium Tincture product, is also classified as a controlled substance. Oxycodone Hydrochloride, a significant component of our Oxycodone Hydrochloride oral solution (5 mg/5 mL), Oxycodone Hydrochloride oral solution (100 mg/5 mL), and Oxycodone Hydrochloride capsule products, is also classified as a controlled substance. CSA and DEA regulations impose specific requirements on manufacturers and other entities that handle these substances including registration, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, security, and distribution. Recordkeeping requirements include accounting for the amount of product received, manufactured, stored, and distributed. Companies handling controlled substances also are required to maintain adequate security and to report suspicious orders, thefts, and significant losses. The DEA periodically inspects facilities for compliance with the CSA and its regulations. Failure to comply with current and future regulations of the DEA could lead to a variety of sanctions, including revocation or denial of renewal of DEA registrations, injunctions, or civil or criminal penalties.
 
In addition, we must submit a request to the DEA for a quota to purchase the amount of morphine sulfate, opium, and oxycodone hydrochloride we need to manufacture Morphine Sulfate oral solution, Opium Tincture, Oxycodone Hydrochloride oral solution (5 mg/5 mL), Oxycodone Hydrochloride oral solution (100 mg/5 mL), and Oxycodone Hydrochloride capsules. Without approved quotas from the DEA, we would not be able to purchase these ingredients from our suppliers. As a result, we are dependent upon the DEA to approve quotas large enough to support our continued manufacture of Morphine Sulfate oral solution, Opium Tincture, Oxycodone Hydrochloride oral solution (5 mg/5 mL), Oxycodone Hydrochloride oral solution (100 mg/5 mL), and Oxycodone Hydrochloride capsules.
 
Unapproved Products
 
Two of our products, EEMT and Opium Tincture, are marketed without approved NDAs or ANDAs. The FDA's policy with respect to the continued marketing of unapproved products appears in the FDA's September 2011 Compliance Policy Guide Sec. 440.100 titled "Marketed New Drugs without Approved NDAs or ANDAs." Under this policy, the FDA has stated that it will follow a risk-based approach with regard to enforcement against marketing of unapproved products. The FDA evaluates whether to initiate enforcement action on a case-by-case basis, but gives higher priority to enforcement action against products in certain categories, such as those with potential safety risks or that lack evidence of effectiveness. While we believe that, so long as we comply with applicable manufacturing standards, the FDA will not take action against us under the current enforcement policy, we can offer no assurances that the FDA will continue this policy or not take a contrary position with any individual product or group of products.
 
Medicaid/Medicare 
 
Medicaid and Medicare, both of which are U.S. federal health care programs administered by CMS, are major purchasers of pharmaceutical products, including those we produce.
 
Medicaid is administered by the states and jointly funded by the federal and state governments. Its focus is on low income populations. State drug coverage policies under Medicaid may vary significantly state by state. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”), as amended by the Health Care and Education and Reconciliation Act of 2010, together known as the Affordable Care Act ("ACA"), required states to expand their Medicaid programs to individuals with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level. Although the United States Supreme Court in 2011 made the Medicaid expansion optional, many states are expanding their Medicaid programs.
 
The ACA also made changes to Medicaid law that could negatively impact us. In particular, pharmaceutical manufacturers must enter into rebate agreements with state Medicaid agencies, which require manufacturers to pay rebates based on their drugs dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries. The ACA raised the rebate percentages for both generic and branded pharmaceuticals effective January 1, 2010. The required rebate is currently 13% of the average manufacturer price for sales of Medicaid-reimbursed products marketed under ANDAs. Sales of Medicaid-reimbursed products marketed under NDAs require manufacturers to rebate the greater of 23.1% of the average manufacturer price or the difference between the average manufacturer price and the "best price" (as defined in the Medicaid statute) during a specific period. Federal and/or state governments may continue to enact measures aimed at reducing the cost of drugs to the Medicaid program.

Medicare is run by the federal government and is largely focused on the elderly and disabled. The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 (“MMA”) created Medicare Part D to provide prescription drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries. The MMA has increased usage of pharmaceuticals, a trend that we believe will continue to benefit the generic pharmaceutical industry. The ACA made some changes to Part D to make it easier for Medicare beneficiaries to obtain drugs, such as reducing coinsurance amounts. The ACA also required pharmaceutical companies to provide discounts to Medicare Part D beneficiaries for the cost of branded prescription drugs. Under the Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program authorized by the ACA, any pharmaceutical product marketed under an NDA, regardless of whether the product is marketed as a "generic," is subject to the discount requirement. Our Candesartan Hydrochlorothiazide, Fenofibrate, Fluvoxamine, Hydrocortisone Enema, Lithium Carbonate ER, Mesalamine, Propranolol ER, and Vancomycin products, while marketed as "generics," are marketed under approved NDAs and, therefore, are subject to the discount requirement. While we may benefit from Medicare changes that have reduced obstacles to drug usage, resulting sales increases, if any, may be offset by existing and future legislative efforts to curb the cost of drugs to the Medicare program.
 
Most of our products are covered by Medicaid and Medicare. Our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid rebate program and other governmental purchasing and rebate programs are complex and may involve subjective decisions. Any determination that we have failed to comply with those obligations could subject us to penalties and sanctions, and we could be subject to federal or state false claims litigation.
 
Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses 
 
We own the trademark names for most of our branded products, including Cortenema, Cortrophin gel, Cortrophin-Zinc, Inderal LA, Inderal XL, InnoPran XL, Lithobid, Reglan, and Vancocin. We license the trademark names for Atacand, Atacand HCT, Arimidex, and Casodex. With the exception of a license for patent technology for InnoPran XL and Inderal XL, we do not own or license any patents associated with these products. Further, patent protection and market exclusivity for these branded products have expired, with the exception of the InnoPran XL and Inderal XL products, who have market exclusivity until 2022. Therefore, we consider the trademark names to be of material value and we act to protect these rights from infringement. However, our business is not dependent upon any single trademark. Trademark protection continues in some countries as long as used; in other countries, as long as registered. Registration is for fixed terms and may be renewed indefinitely. We believe that sales of our branded products have benefited and will continue to benefit from the value of the product name. In addition, we receive royalties from a license for patent rights initially owned by Cell Genesys, Inc., which merged with BioSante in 2009. The royalties are received as a result of sales and milestones related to the Yescarta® product. In 2018, we recorded $1.8 million of royalties related to the license of these patent rights.
Distribution Agreements 
 
In addition to selling products under our own NDAs and ANDAs, we enter into marketing and distribution agreements with third parties in which we sell products under ANDAs or NDAs owned or licensed by these third parties. These products are sold under our own label.
 
We market and distribute Fenofibrate, an authorized generic of Lipofen®, under an agreement with Kowa Pharmaceuticals America, Inc. Under the agreement, we retain 7.5% of gross profits on sales of the product. We launched the Fenofibrate product under our own label in May 2016. The agreement may be terminated by either party under certain specified circumstances.
 
Customers
 
Our customers purchase and distribute our products. Our products are sold by three major retail pharmacy chains: CVS, Rite Aid, and Walgreens. Our customers include five major national wholesalers: AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health, McKesson, Anda, and Morris Dickson. In addition, our customers include national mail order houses, including CVS Caremark, Humana, and ExpressScripts, as well as group purchasing organizations.

In recent years, the wholesale distributor network for pharmaceutical products has been subject to increasing consolidation, which has increased the concentration of our wholesale customers. In addition, the number of retail market chains and, in particular, the number of independent drug stores and small chains, has decreased as retail consolidation has occurred, also increasing the concentration of our retail customers. As a result of this trend toward consolidation, a smaller number of companies each control a larger share of pharmaceutical distribution channels. For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 81% of our net revenues were attributable to three wholesalers: McKesson Corporation (21%), AmerisourceBergen Corporation (33%), and Cardinal Health, Inc. (23%). For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc., and AmerisourceBergen Corporation, together accounted for approximately 78% and 68% of our net revenues, respectively. In addition, as noted below, our customers also distribute our products. The loss of any of these customers, including in their role as distributors, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Due to a strategic partnership between Amerisource Bergen and Walgreens, Amerisource Bergen handles product distribution for Walgreens. Similarly, Cardinal Health and CVS established a partnership in which Cardinal performs some product distribution for CVS. McKesson also entered into a strategic alliance with both Wal-Mart and Rite Aid. As a result of these strategic partnerships between wholesalers and pharmacy chains, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, increases in net sales to the wholesalers, with corresponding decreases in net sales to the pharmacy chains.
 
Consistent with industry practice, we maintain a return policy that allows customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date. Generally, product may be returned for a period beginning six months prior to its expiration date to up to one year after its expiration date. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition—Critical Accounting Estimates" for a discussion of our accruals for chargebacks, rebates, returns, and other allowances.

Competition 
 
Certain of our products face limited competition due to complexities in formulation, active pharmaceutical ingredient sourcing, materials handling and manufacturing, and regulatory hurdles. Nevertheless, we compete with numerous other pharmaceutical companies, including large, global pharmaceutical manufacturers capable of addressing these complexities and hurdles with respect to products that we currently produce and products that are in our pipeline. In addition, our products are subject to competition from other generic products and non-prescription alternative therapies.
 
Our branded pharmaceutical products currently face competition from generic products and we expect them to continue to face competition from generic products in the future. In order to launch a generic product, a manufacturer must apply to the FDA for an ANDA showing that the generic product is therapeutically equivalent to the RLD. (See “Government Regulation.”)
 
The primary means of competition among generic drug manufacturers are pricing, contract terms, service levels, and reliability. To compete effectively, we seek to consistently produce high-quality, reliable, and effective products. We also establish active working relationships with each of our customers, continually gather important market information in order to respond successfully to requests for proposals, maintain sufficient inventories to assure high service levels, and work to reduce product costs by sourcing and qualifying alternative suppliers whenever possible.

Our sales can be impacted by new studies that indicate that a competitor's product has greater efficacy than one of our products. If competitors introduce new products with therapeutic or cost advantages, our products can be subject to progressive price reductions and/or decreased volume of sales.
 
Principal competitors for the pharmaceutical market in which we do business include Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Alvogen, Inc., Apotex Inc., Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Hikma Pharmaceuticals plc, Method Pharmaceuticals, LLC, Mylan N.V., Par Pharmaceutical, Inc., Perrigo Company plc, Rising Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.
 
Pharmaceutical Industry Trends
 
In recent years, the pharmaceutical industry has experienced significant consolidation, particularly in distribution channels and amongst generic and brand drug companies.
 
The wholesale distributor network for pharmaceutical products has been subject to increasing consolidation, which has increased the concentration of our wholesale customers. In addition, the number of retail market chains and, in particular, the number of independent drug stores and small chains, has decreased as retail consolidation has occurred, also increasing the concentration of our retail customers. As a result of this trend toward consolidation, a smaller number of companies each control a larger share of pharmaceutical distribution channels.
 
In addition, consolidation amongst pharmaceutical companies has created opportunities by reducing the number of competitors. However, as competitors grow larger through consolidation, so do their resources. Larger competitors may be able to aggressively decrease prices in order to gain market share on certain products and may have resources that would allow them to more effectively market their products to potential customers.
 
Product Liability 
 
Product liability litigation represents an inherent risk to all firms in the pharmaceutical industry. We utilize traditional third-party insurance policies with regard to our product liability claims. Such insurance coverage at any given time reflects current market conditions, including cost and availability, when the policy is written.
 
All manufacturers of the drug Reglan and its generic equivalent metoclopramide, including ANI, have faced allegations from plaintiffs in various states, including California, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, claiming bodily injuries as a result of ingestion of metoclopramide or its brand name, Reglan, prior to the FDA's February 2009 Black Box warning requirement. In August 2012, we were dismissed with prejudice from all New Jersey complaints. In August 2016, we settled the outstanding California short form complaints and in February 2018, we settled the remaining four complaints that were not captured in the 2016 settlement. We consider our exposure to this litigation to be limited due to several factors: (1) the only generic metoclopramide that we manufactured prior to the implementation of the FDA's warning requirement was an oral solution introduced after May 28, 2008; (2) our market share for the oral solution was a very small portion of the overall metoclopramide market; and (3) once we received a request for change of labeling from the FDA, we submitted our proposed changes within 30 days, and such changes were subsequently approved by the FDA.
 
At the present time, we are unable to assess the likely outcome of the cases in the remaining states. Our insurance company has assumed the defense of this matter and paid all losses in settlement of the California cases. We cannot provide assurances that the outcome of these matters will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Furthermore, like all pharmaceutical manufacturers, we may be exposed to other product liability claims in the future, which could limit our coverage under future insurance policies or cause those policies to become more expensive, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.
 
Backlog
 
We define backlog as firm orders received prior to December 31, 2018 that have not been shipped as of December 31, 2018. We had a backlog of $6.3 million, $0.5 million, and $0.8 million at December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, relating to contract manufacturing purchase orders from customers.
Employees 
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 299 full-time employees.

Seasonality of Business
 
We do not believe our business is subject to seasonality. However, our business can be affected by the business practices of our business partners. To the extent that the availability of inventory or materials from or development practices of our partners is seasonal, our sales may be subject to fluctuations quarter to quarter or year to year.
