Item 1. | Business.
--------+----------

 General. Home Bancorp, Inc. (the Company) is a Louisiana corporation and the holding company for Home Bank, N.A. (the Bank). The Bank, which is headquartered in Lafayette, Louisiana and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, currently conducts business through 39 banking offices in the Acadiana, Baton Rouge, Greater New Orleans and Northshore (of Lake Pontchartrain) regions of south Louisiana and the Natchez and Vicksburg regions of west Mississippi.
 As of March 2, 2015, the Bank converted from a federal savings bank to a national bank with the title Home Bank, National Association. As a result of the Banks conversion to a national bank, the Company is now subject to regulation as a bank holding company by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the FRB or the Federal Reserve). Prior to the Banks charter conversion, the Company was regulated by the FRB as a savings and loan holding company. In September 2018, the Bank established HB Investment Fund I, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank to invest in New Market Tax Credits (NMTC) in our market areas. 
 The Bank is primarily engaged in attracting deposits from the general public and using those funds to invest in loans and securities. Our principal sources of funds are customer deposits, repayments of loans, repayments of investments and funds borrowed from outside sources such as the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of Dallas.

 These funds are primarily used for the origination of loans, including one-to four-family first mortgage loans, home equity loans and lines, commercial real estate loans, construction and land loans, multi-family residential loans, commercial and industrial loans and consumer loans. The Bank derives its income principally from interest earned on loans and investment securities and, to a lesser extent, from fees received in connection with the origination of loans, service charges on deposit accounts and for other services. The Banks primary expenses are general operating expenses, the most significant of which is compensation and benefits. 
 Although we continue to be an active originator of residential home mortgage loans and other consumer loans in our market areas, our efforts are focused on originating commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans. Commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans are deemed attractive due to their generally higher yields and shorter anticipated lives compared to single-family residential mortgage loans. In addition, the Bank views commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans as attractive lending products because the Banks commercial borrowers typically maintain deposit accounts at the Bank, increasing the Banks core deposits. 
 The Companys headquarters is located at 503 Kaliste Saloom Road, Lafayette, Louisiana, and our telephone number is (337) 237-1960. We maintain a website at www.home24bank.com, and we provide our customers with online banking services. Information on our website should not be considered a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Market Area and Competition 
 The Bank has four primary market areas across south Louisiana: Acadiana, Baton Rouge, Greater New Orleans, and the Northshore (of Lake Pontchartrain) and two primary market areas in west Mississippi: Natchez and Vicksburg. Since completing its initial public offering of stock in October 2008, the Company has acquired five other financial institutions. In 2010, the Company expanded into the Northshore (of Lake Pontchartrain) through a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) assisted transaction of certain assets and liabilities of the former Statewide Bank (Statewide). The Bank currently operates six banking offices in the Northshore region. In 2011, the Company expanded into the Greater New Orleans area through the acquisition of GS Financial Corporation (GSFC) and its subsidiary, Guaranty Savings Bank (Guaranty). In February 2014, the Company expanded into Natchez and Vicksburg, Mississippi through the acquisition of Britton & Koontz Capital Corporation (Britton & Koontz) and its subsidiary, Britton & Koontz Bank, N.A. (Britton & Koontz Bank). The Bank currently operates three banking offices in Natchez and one banking office in Vicksburg. In September 2015, the Company increased its presence in Greater New Orleans through the acquisition of Louisiana Bancorp, Inc. (LABC) and its subsidiary, Bank of New Orleans. The Bank currently operates six banking offices in the Greater New Orleans area. In December 2017, the Company increased its presence in the Acadiana region through its acquisition of St. Martin Bancshares (SMB) and its subsidiary, St. Martin Bank & Trust Company (St. Martin Bank). The Company now operates 20 banking offices in the Acadiana region. The Bank currently operates three banking offices in Baton Rouge. For additional information on our acquisition activity, see Part II, Item 7 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Acquisition Activity. 
 We face significant competition in originating loans and attracting deposits. This competition stems primarily from other banks, credit unions and mortgage-banking companies. Many of the financial service providers operating in our market areas are significantly larger and have greater financial resources. We face additional competition for deposits from short-term money market funds and other corporate and government securities funds, mutual funds and from other non-depository financial institutions such as brokerage firms and insurance companies. More recently, innovations in loan and deposit products brought about by financial technology companies have added to the level of competition for originating loans and attracting deposits. 
Supervision and Regulation 
 Set forth below is a brief description of certain laws relating to the regulation of Home Bancorp, Inc. and Home Bank. This description does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to applicable laws and regulations. 
 
2 


 General. Home Bank, N.A. is subject to federal regulation and oversight by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). The Bank is also subject to regulation and examination by the FDIC, which insures the deposits of the Bank to the maximum extent permitted by law, and requirements established by the Federal Reserve. In the last several years, the Company has experienced heightened regulatory requirements and scrutiny following the global financial crisis and the enactment in 2010 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act). Resulting reforms have caused the Companys compliance and risk management processes, and the costs thereof, to increase. The legislation enacted in 2018 and summarized below may reduce some of the burdens associated with implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act, but the actual impact of this administrations policies regarding the Dodd-Frank reforms and the 2018 regulatory reforms is impossible to predict with any certainty. 
 Federal law provides the federal banking regulators with substantial enforcement powers. The OCCs enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports filed with the OCC. The FRB has comparable enforcement authority over the Company. In addition, the FDIC, as the insurer of the Banks deposits, can initiate enforcement proceedings, remove Bank officials and suspend or terminate deposit insurance. Any change in such regulations could have a material adverse impact on the Company and the Bank. 
 In May 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the Act), was enacted to modify or remove certain financial reform rules and regulations, including some of those implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act. While the Act maintains most of the regulatory structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act, it amends certain aspects of the regulatory framework for small depository institutions with assets of less than $10 billion and for large banks with assets of more than $50 billion. Many of these changes could result in meaningful regulatory relief for community banks such as the Bank 
 The Act, among other matters, expands the definition of qualified mortgages which may be held by a financial institution and simplifies the regulatory capital rules for financial institutions and their holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion by instructing the federal banking regulators to establish a single Community Bank Leverage Ratio of between 8 and 10 percent to replace the leverage and risk-based regulatory capital ratios. The Act also expands the category of holding companies that may rely on the Small Bank Holding Company and Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement by raising the maximum amount of assets a qualifying holding company may have from $1 billion to $3 billion. This expansion also excludes such holding companies from the minimum capital requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. In addition, the Act includes regulatory relief for community banks regarding regulatory examination cycles, call reports, the Volcker Rule (proprietary trading prohibitions), mortgage disclosures and risk weights for certain high-risk commercial real estate loans. 
 It is difficult at this time to predict when or how any new standards under the Act will ultimately be applied to us or what specific impact the Act and the final implementing rules and regulations will have on community banks. 
 Regulation of Home Bancorp, Inc. 
 The Company was a savings and loan holding company until March 2, 2015, and it is now a bank holding company, subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has enforcement authority with respect to the Company similar to that of the OCC over the Bank. Applicable federal law and regulations limit the activities of the Company and require the approval of the Federal Reserve for any acquisition of a subsidiary, including another financial institution or holding company thereof, or a merger or acquisition of the Company. The Company must serve as a source of strength for the Bank, maintaining the ability to provide financial assistance if the Bank suffers financial distress. These and other Federal Reserve policies may restrict the Companys ability to pay dividends. In addition, dividends from the Company may depend, in part, upon its receipt of dividends from the Bank. If the Company does not have the required capital conservation buffer or otherwise meet its new capital requirements, its ability to pay dividends to its stockholders will be limited. 
 A bank holding company is required to give the Federal Reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when 
 
3 


  combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemption during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the companys consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve order, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with the Federal Reserve. This notification requirement does not apply to any company that meets the well-capitalized standard for bank holding companies, is well-managed and is not subject to any unresolved supervisory issues. 
 Permissible Activities. The business activities of the Company are generally limited to those activities permissible for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act and certain additional activities authorized by the Federal Reserve regulations. The Bank Holding Company Act generally prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company. A bank holding company must obtain Federal Reserve Board approval before acquiring directly or indirectly, ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, it would own or control more than 5% of such shares (unless it already owns or controls the majority of such shares). 
 Capital Requirements. Prior to January 1, 2015, there were no Federal Reserve regulations establishing minimum regulatory capital requirements for savings and loan holding companies. On January 1, 2015, new capital requirements generally applicable to both bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies became effective. The new regulatory capital requirements applicable to the Company are the same as the new capital requirements for the Bank. For a description of these capital requirements, see Regulation of Home Bank, N.A. - Recent Regulatory Capital Regulations. 
 Federal Securities Laws. We have registered our common stock with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Accordingly, the Company is subject to the proxy and tender offer rules, insider trading reporting requirements and restrictions and certain other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As a public company, the Company is subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 which addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. As directed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer are required to certify that our quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact. The rules adopted by the SEC under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have several requirements, including having these officers certify that: they are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting; they have made certain disclosures to our independent auditors and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors about our internal control over financial reporting; and they have included information in our quarterly and annual reports about their evaluation and whether there have been changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could materially affect internal control over financial reporting. 
 Volcker Rule Regulations. Regulations have been adopted by the federal banking agencies to implement the provisions of the Dodd Frank Act commonly referred to as the Volcker Rule. The regulations contain prohibitions and restrictions on the ability of financial institution holding companies and their affiliates to engage in proprietary trading and to hold certain interests in, or to have certain relationships with, various types of investment funds, including hedge funds and private equity funds. The regulations were phased in over a period ending on July 21, 2015. The Companys investment portfolio is in compliance with the various provisions of the Volcker Rule regulations as of December 31, 2018. However, a provision in the Act enacted in May 2018 exempts banks with assets less than $10 billion from the Volcker Rule. 
 Regulation of Home Bank, N.A. 
 General. The Bank is subject to regulation and oversight by the OCC extending to all aspects of its operations. As part of this authority, the Bank is required to file periodic reports with the OCC and is subject to periodic examinations by the OCC and the FDIC. The investment and lending authorities of national banks are prescribed by federal laws and regulations, and such institutions are prohibited from engaging in any activities not permitted by such laws and regulations. Such regulation and supervision is primarily intended for the protection of depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund.

 The OCCs enforcement authority over national banks includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports filed with the OCC. 
 Insurance of Accounts. The deposits of the Bank are insured to the maximum extent permitted by the Deposit Insurance Fund and are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased deposit insurance on most accounts to $250,000. As insurer, the FDIC is authorized to conduct examinations of, and to require reporting by, insured institutions. It also may prohibit any insured institution from engaging in any activity determined by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the FDIC. The FDIC also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against insured institutions. 
 The Dodd Frank Act raises the minimum reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund from 1.15% to 1.35% and requires the FDIC to offset the effect of this increase on insured institutions with assets of less than $10 billion (small institutions). In March 2016, the FDIC adopted a rule to accomplish this by imposing a surcharge on larger institutions commencing when the reserve ratio reaches 1.15% and ending when it reaches 1.35%. The reserve ratio reached 1.15% effective as of June 30, 2016. The surcharge period began effective July 1, 2016 and ended on September 30, 2018 when the reserve ratio reached 1.36%. Small institutions will receive credits for the portion of their regular assessments that contributed to growth in the reserve ratio between 1.15% and 1.35%. The credits will apply to reduce regular assessments by 2.0 basis points for quarters when the reserve ratio is at least 1.38%. 
 Effective July 1, 2016, the FDIC adopted changes that eliminated its risk-based premium system. Under the new premium system, the FDIC assesses deposit insurance premiums on the assessment base of a depository institution, which is its average total assets reduced by the amount of its average tangible equity. For a small institution (one with assets of less than $10 billion) that has been federally insured for at least five years, effective July 1, 2016, the initial base assessment rate ranges from 3 to 30 basis points, based on the institutions CAMELS composite and component ratings and certain financial ratios; its leverage ratio; its ratio of net income before taxes to total assets; its ratio of nonperforming loans and leases to gross assets; its ratio of other real estate owned to gross assets; its brokered deposits ratio (excluding reciprocal deposits if the institution is well capitalized and has a CAMELS composite rating of 1 or 2); its one year asset growth ratio (which penalizes growth adjusted for mergers in excess of 10%); and its loan mix index (which penalizes higher risk loans based on historical industry charge off rates). The initial base assessment rate is subject to downward adjustment (not below 1.5%) based on the ratio of unsecured debt the institution has issued to its assessment base, and to upward adjustment (which can cause the rate to exceed 30 basis points) based on its holdings of unsecured debt issued by other insured institutions. Institutions with assets of $10 billion or more are assessed using a scorecard method. 
 In addition, all institutions with deposits insured by the FDIC are required to pay assessments to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, a mixed-ownership government corporation established to recapitalize the predecessor to the Deposit Insurance Fund. The annual assessment rate set for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 0.000014% of insured deposits and is adjusted quarterly. These assessments will continue until the Financing Corporation bonds mature in 2019. 
 The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution if it determines after a hearing that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order or any condition imposed by an agreement with the FDIC. It also may suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance, if the institution has no tangible capital. If insurance of accounts is terminated, the accounts at the institution at the time of the termination, less subsequent withdrawals, shall continue to be insured for a period of six months to two years, as determined by the FDIC. Management is aware of no existing circumstances which would result in termination of the Banks deposit insurance. 
 Basel III and Dodd-Frank Act Regulatory Capital Regulations. In July of 2013, the respective U.S. federal banking agencies issued final rules implementing Basel III and the Dodd-Frank Act capital requirements which 
 
5 


  became fully phased in on a global basis on January 1, 2019. The regulations establish a new tangible common equity capital requirement, increase the minimum requirement for the current Tier 1 risk-weighted asset (RWA) ratio, phase out certain kinds of intangibles treated as capital and certain types of instruments and change the risk weightings of certain assets used to determine required capital ratios. The new common equity Tier 1 capital component requires capital of the highest quality  predominantly composed of retained earnings and common stock instruments. For community banks, such as Home Bank, a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% became effective on January 1, 2015. The new capital rules also increased the current minimum Tier 1 capital ratio from 4.0% to 6.0% beginning on January 1, 2015. In addition, in order to make capital distributions and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers without restriction, an institution must also maintain greater than 2.5% in common equity attributable to a capital conservation buffer which became fully phased in on January 1, 2019. The new rules also increase the risk weights for several categories of assets, including an increase from 100% to 150% for certain acquisition, development and construction loans and more than 90-day past due exposures. The new capital rules maintain the general structure of the prompt corrective action rules (described below), but incorporate the new common equity Tier 1 capital requirement and the increased Tier 1 RWA requirement into the prompt corrective action framework. 
 Regulatory Capital Requirements. National banks are required to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital. Current OCC capital standards require these institutions to satisfy a common equity Tier 1 capital requirement, a leverage capital requirement and a risk-based capital requirement. The common equity Tier 1 capital component generally consists of retained earnings and common stock instruments and must equal at least 4.5% of risk-weighted assets. Leverage capital, also known as core capital, must equal at least 3.0% of adjusted total assets for the most highly rated national banks. Core capital generally consists of common stockholders equity (including retained earnings). An additional cushion of at least 100 basis points is required for all other institutions, which effectively increases their minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio to 4.0% or more. Under the OCCs regulations, the most highly-rated national banks are those that the OCC determines are strong banking organization and are rated composite 1 under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System. Under the risk-based capital requested, total capital (a combination of core and supplementary capital) must equal at least 8.0% of risk-weighted assets. The OCC also is authorized to impose capital requirements in excess of these standards on individual institutions on a case-by-case basis. 
 In determining compliance with the risk-based capital requirement, a national bank is allowed to include both core capital and supplementary capital in its total capital, provided that the amount of supplementary capital included does not exceed the national banks core capital. Supplementary capital generally consists of general allowances for loan losses up to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, together with certain other items. In determining the required amount of risk-based capital, total assets, including certain off-balance sheet items, are multiplied by a risk weight ranging from 0% to 1250% based on the risks inherent in the type of assets. The Bank does not have any assets assigned to a risk category over 400%.     
 National banks must value securities available for sale at amortized cost for regulatory capital purposes. This means that in computing regulatory capital, national banks should add back any unrealized losses and deduct any unrealized gains, net of income taxes, on debt securities reported as a separate component of capital, as defined by generally accepted accounting principles. 
 At December 31, 2018, the Bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements, with Tier 1, Tier 1 common equity, Tier 1 common equity (to risk-weighted assets) and total risk-based capital ratios of 11.15%, 14.55%, 14.55% and 15.59%, respectively. 
 As summarized above, in May 2018 the Act amended certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act to ease the regulatory burden for small- to medium-sized U. S. banks. The new legislation, among other things, raised the systemically important financial institution (SIFI) threshold which dictates capital requirements and imposed new rules aimed at simplifying the calculation of regulatory capital ratios. 
 Any national bank that fails any of the capital requirements is subject to possible enforcement action by the OCC or the FDIC. Such action could include a capital directive, a cease and desist order, civil money penalties, the establishment of restrictions on the institutions operations, termination of federal deposit insurance and the appointment of a conservator or receiver. The OCCs capital regulations provide that such actions, through enforcement proceedings or otherwise, could require one or more of a variety of corrective actions.

 Prompt Corrective Action. The following table shows the amount of capital associated with the different capital categories set forth in the prompt corrective action regulations. 
 

Capital Category | Total Risk-BasedCapital | Tier 1 Risk-BasedCapital | Tier 1 Common Equity Capital | Tier 1 LeverageCapital
Well capitalized | 10% or more | 8% or more | 6.5% or more | 5% or more 
Adequately capitalized | 8% or more | 6% or more | 4.5% or more | 4% or more 
Undercapitalized | Less than 8% | Less than 6% | Less than 4.5% | Less than 4% 
Significantly undercapitalized | Less than 6% | Less than 4% | Less than 3% | Less than 3% 

 In addition, an institution is critically undercapitalized if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%. Under specified circumstances, a federal banking agency may reclassify a well-capitalized institution as adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized institution or an undercapitalized institution to comply with supervisory actions as if it were in the next lower category (except that the OCC may not reclassify a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized). 
 An institution generally must file a written capital restoration plan which meets specified requirements within 45 days of the date that the institution receives notice or is deemed to have notice that it is undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized. A federal banking agency must provide the institution with written notice of approval or disapproval within 60 days after receiving a capital restoration plan, subject to extensions by the agency. An institution which is required to submit a capital restoration plan must concurrently submit a performance guaranty by each company that controls the institution. In addition, undercapitalized institutions are subject to various regulatory restrictions, and the appropriate federal banking agency also may take any number of discretionary supervisory actions. 
 As of December 31, 2018, the Bank was deemed a well-capitalized institution for purposes of the above regulations and as such is not subject to the above mentioned restrictions. 
 Limitations on Dividends. OCC regulations impose various restrictions on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends. The Bank generally may pay dividends during any calendar year in an amount up to 100% of net income for the year-to-date plus retained net income for the two preceding years, so long as it is well-capitalized after the distribution. If the Bank proposes to pay a dividend when it does not meet its capital requirements or that will exceed these limitations, it must obtain the OCCs prior approval. The OCC may object to a proposed dividend based on safety and soundness concerns. No insured depository institution may pay a dividend if, after paying the dividend, the institution would be undercapitalized. In addition, as noted above, beginning in 2016, if Home Bank does not have the required capital conservation buffer, its ability to pay dividends to the Company will be limited. 
 Limitations on Transactions with Affiliates. Transactions between a national bank and any affiliate are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. An affiliate of a national bank includes any company or entity which controls the national bank or that is controlled by a company that controls the national bank. In a holding company context, the holding company of a national bank (such as the Company) and any companies which are controlled by such holding company are affiliates of the national bank. Generally, Section 23A limits the extent to which the national bank or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of such banks capital stock and surplus, and contain an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20% of such capital stock and surplus. Section 23B applies to covered transactions as well as certain other transactions and requires that all transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the national bank as those provided to a non-affiliate. The term covered transaction includes the making of loans to, purchase of assets from and issuance of a guarantee to an affiliate and similar transactions. Section 23B transactions also include the provision of services and the sale of assets by a national bank to an affiliate.

 In addition, Sections 22(g) and (h) of the Federal Reserve Act, place restrictions on loans to executive officers, directors and principal shareholders of a national bank and its affiliates. Under Section 22(h), loans to a director, an executive officer, a greater than 10% shareholder of a national bank and certain affiliated interests of either, may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated interests, a national banks loans to one borrower limit (generally equal to 15% of the banks unimpaired capital and surplus). Section 22(h) also requires that loans to directors, executive officers and principal shareholders be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons unless the loans are made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that (i) is widely available to employees of the bank and (ii) does not give preference to any director, executive officer or principal shareholder or certain affiliated interests of either, over other employees of the national bank. Section 22(h) also requires prior board approval for certain loans. In addition, the aggregate amount of extensions of credit by a national bank to all insiders cannot exceed the banks unimpaired capital and surplus. Furthermore, Section 22(g) places additional restrictions on loans to executive officers. The Bank currently is subject to Sections 22(g) and (h) of the Federal Reserve Act, and as of December 31, 2018 was in compliance with the above restrictions. 
 Consumer Financial Services. The historical structure of federal consumer protection regulation applicable to all providers of consumer financial products and services changed significantly with the establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) as part of the Dodd-Frank Act reforms. On July 21, 2011, the CFPB commenced operations to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all providers of consumer products and services, including the Bank, as well as the authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices. CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over providers with more than $10 billion in assets. FDIC-insured institutions with $10 billion or less in assets, like the Bank, continue to be examined by their applicable bank regulators. 
 Anti-money Laundering. All financial institutions, including national banks, are subject to federal laws that are designed to prevent the use of the U.S. financial system to fund terrorist activities. Financial institutions operating in the United States must develop anti-money laundering compliance programs, due diligence policies and controls to ensure the detection and reporting of money laundering. Such compliance programs are intended to supplement compliance requirements, also applicable to financial institutions, under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulations. The Bank has established policies and procedures to ensure compliance with these provisions. 
 Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Dallas, which is one of 11 regional FHLBs that administer the home financing credit function of various financial institutions. Each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. It is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB System. It makes loans to members (i.e., advances) in accordance with policies and procedures established by the board of directors of the FHLB. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank had $58.7 million of FHLB advances and $726 million available on its line of credit with the FHLB. 
 As a member, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB of Dallas in an amount equal to at least 0.4% of its total assets in Class B-1 stock and activity-based investment of Class B-2 stock equal to 4.1% of its advances outstanding and 2.0% of acquired members advances currently on the Banks balance sheet. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank had $5.6 million in FHLB stock, which was in compliance with this requirement. 
 The FHLBs are required to provide funds for the resolution of troubled savings institutions and to contribute to affordable housing programs through direct loans or interest subsidies on advances targeted for community investment and low- and moderate-income housing projects. These contributions have adversely affected the level of FHLB dividends paid in the past and could do so in the future. These contributions also could have an adverse effect on the value of FHLB stock in the future. 
 Federal Reserve System. The FRB requires all depository institutions to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts and non-personal time deposits. The required reserves must be maintained in the form of vault cash or an account at the FRB. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank had met its reserve requirement.

 Privacy. Financial institutions are required to disclose their policies for collecting and protecting confidential information. Customers generally may prevent financial institutions from sharing personal financial information with nonaffiliated third parties except for third parties that market the institutions own products and services. 
 Additionally, financial institutions generally may not disclose consumer account numbers to any nonaffiliated third party for use in telemarketing, direct mail marketing or other marketing through electronic mail to consumers. The Bank has established policies and procedures designed to safeguard its customers personal financial information and to ensure compliance with applicable privacy laws.
