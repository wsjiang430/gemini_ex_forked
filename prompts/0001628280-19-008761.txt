ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
Cinedigm Corp. was incorporated in Delaware on March 31, 2000 (“Cinedigm”, and collectively with its subsidiaries, the “Company”). We are (i) a leading distributor and aggregator of independent movie, television and other short form content managing a library of distribution rights to thousands of titles and episodes released across digital, physical, and home and mobile entertainment platforms as well as (ii) a leading servicer of digital cinema assets on over 12,000 domestic and foreign movie screens.
Since our inception, we have played a significant role in the digital distribution revolution that continues to transform the media landscape. In addition to our pioneering role in transitioning over 12,000 movie screens from traditional analog film prints to digital distribution, we have become a leading distributor of independent content, both through organic growth and acquisitions. We distribute products for major brands such as Hallmark, Televisa, ITV, Nelvana, ZDF, Shout! Factory, NFL, NHL and Scholastic as well as leading international and domestic content creators, movie producers, television producers and other short form digital content producers. We collaborate with producers, major brands and other content owners to market, source, curate and distribute quality content to targeted audiences through (i) existing and emerging digital home entertainment platforms, including Apple, Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Xbox, PlayStation, Walmart Now and cable/satellite video-on-demand ("VOD") and (ii) packaged distribution of DVD and Blu-ray discs to wholesalers and retailers with sales coverage to over 60,000 brick and mortar storefronts, including Walmart, Target, Best Buy and Amazon. In addition, we operate a growing number of branded and curated over-the-top ("OTT") entertainment channels, including Docurama, CONtv and Dove Channel.

Change of Reportable Segments
We previously had four reportable segments. As of April 1, 2018, information that our Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM") regularly reviews, for purposes of evaluating Company performance has been aggregated due to the winding down of Cinedigm Digital Funding I, LLC ("CDF I"). As a result, the Company reassessed and decided to revise its determination of the reportable segments. We now present our results of operations in two reportable segments as follows: (1) Cinema Equipment Business and (2) Content and Entertainment Business (“Content & Entertainment” or "CEG"). See Note 9 - Segment Information for detailed descriptions of our segments. We have retrospectively recast the results of operations for the reportable segments for all periods presented.
We are structured so that our Cinema Equipment Business operates independently from our Content & Entertainment business. As of March 31, 2019, we had approximately $20.6 million of non-recourse outstanding debt principal that relates to, and is serviced by, our Cinema Equipment Business. We also have approximately $44.8 million of outstanding debt principal, as of March 31, 2019 that is attributable to our Content & Entertainment and Corporate segments. 
CONTENT & ENTERTAINMENT 
Content Distribution and our OTT Entertainment Channels and Applications
Cinedigm Entertainment Group, or CEG, is a leading independent content distributor in North America as well as an innovator and leader in the quickly evolving OTT digital network business. We are unique among most independent distributors because of our direct relationships with thousands of physical retail locations and digital platforms, including Walmart, Target, Apple, Netflix and Amazon, as well as the national Video on Demand platforms. Our library of films and television episodes encompass award winning documentaries from Docurama Films®, acclaimed independent films, festival picks and a wide range of content from brand name suppliers, including Scholastic, NFL, Shout! Factory and Hallmark.
Additionally, we are leveraging our infrastructure, technology, content and distribution expertise to rapidly and cost effectively build and expand our OTT digital network business. Our first channel, Docurama, launched in May 2014 as an advertising supported video on demand service ("AVOD") across most Internet connected devices and now contains hundreds of documentary films to stream. In December 2015, we successfully transitioned Docurama to a subscription video on demand ("SVOD") service with its launch on Amazon Prime. In March 2015, we launched CONtv in partnership with Wizard World, Inc., a fandom and pop culture entertainment targeted lifestyle channel and "Freemium" service with both AVOD and SVOD components. Our Freemium business model provides users with free content and the ability to upgrade to a selection of premium services by paying subscription fees. CONtv is one of the largest Freemium OTT channels available in terms of hours of content, with over 3,000 hours of film and television episodes, including original programs and live coverage of Comic-Con and pop culture events from around the country. In the fall of 2015, we introduced our third OTT channel, Dove Entertainment Channel, which is a family entertainment service providing high-quality film and television programs approved by the Dove Foundation. In April 2018, we launched two channels: Wham Network, which is an entertainment, news and lifestyle channel targeting the eSports industry; and COMBAT GO, a 24/7, mixed martial arts, worldwide combat channel. We now have a total of five networks distributed, and four to five more in our development pipeline slated to roll out over the next 12 months.
We distribute our OTT content in two distinct ways: direct to consumer, through major application platforms such as the web, iOS, Android, Roku, AppleTV, Amazon Fire, Vizio, and Samsung; and through third party distributors of content on emerging platforms such as Amazon Prime, Twitch, Xumo and Sling/ Dish.
CEG has focused its activities in the areas of: (1) ancillary market aggregation and distribution of entertainment content, and (2) branded and curated over-the-top OTT digital network business providing entertainment channels and applications. With these complementary entertainment distribution capabilities, we believe that we are capitalizing on the key drivers of value that we believe are critical to success in content distribution going forward. Our CEG segment holds direct relationships with physical retail locations and digital platforms, including Walmart, Target, Apple, Netflix and Amazon, as well as the national Video on Demand platforms.
Our Strategy
Direct to consumer digital distribution of film and television content over the Internet is rapidly growing. We believe that our large library of film and television episodes, long-standing relationships with digital platforms, up-to-date technologies and four years of experience operating OTT channels, will allow us to continue to build a diversified portfolio of narrowcast OTT channels that generate recurring revenue streams from advertising, merchandising and subscriptions. We plan to launch niche 
2

channels that make use of our existing library of titles, while partnering with strong brands that bring name recognition, marketing support and an existing customer base for new channel opportunities.
Rapid changes in the entertainment landscape require that we continually refine our strategy to adapt to new technologies and consumer behaviors. For example, we have added acquisitions of home entertainment content to focus on long-term partnerships with producers of high quality, cast-driven, genre content, to our traditional catalog-based titles business. In recent years, we acquired all North American distribution rights to a variety of new and original films. In addition, we have accelerated our efforts to be a leader in the OTT digital network business, where we can leverage our existing infrastructure and library, in partnership with well-known brands, to distribute our content direct-to-consumers.
We believe that we are well positioned to succeed in the OTT channel business for the following key reasons: 

• | Four years of history operating OTT channels with millions of downloads, hundreds of thousands of registered users, and hundreds of millions of discrete data points on our customer’s behavior and preferences,


• | The depth and breadth of our almost 50,000 title film and television episode library,


• | Our digital assets and deep, long-standing relationships as launch partners that cover the major digital platforms and devices,


• | Our marketing expertise,


• | Our flexible releasing strategies, which differ from larger entertainment companies that need to protect their legacy businesses, and


• | Our experienced management team

CINEMA EQUIPMENT BUSINESS 
 As discussed above, we have retrospectively recast the operating segments for the prior period. The Phase I Deployment and Phase II Deployment operations consist of the following: 

Operations of: | Products and services provided: 
Cinema Equipment Business | Financing vehicles and administrators for 3,480 Systems installed nationwide in our first deployment phase (“Phase I Deployment”) to theatrical exhibitors and for 5,853 Systems installed domestically and internationally in our second deployment phase (“Phase II Deployment”). We retain ownership of the Systems and the residual cash flows related to the Systems in Phase I Deployment after the repayment of all non-recourse debt at the expiration of exhibitor master license agreements. For certain Phase II Deployment Systems, we do not retain ownership of the residual cash flows and digital cinema equipment in Phase II Deployment after the completion of cost recoupment and at the expiration of the exhibitor master license agreements.The Cinema Equipment Business also provides monitoring, collection, verification and management services to this segment, as well as to exhibitors who purchase their own equipment, and also collects and disburses VPFs from motion picture studios, distributors and ACFs from alternative content providers, movie exhibitors and theatrical exhibitors (collectively, “Services”). 

In June 2005, we formed our Phase I Deployment segment in order to purchase up to 4,000 Systems under an amended framework agreement with Christie Digital Systems USA, Inc. (“Christie”). As of March 31, 2019, Phase I Deployment had 3,480 Systems installed.
In October 2007, we formed our Phase II Deployment segment for the administration of up to 10,000 additional Systems. As of March 31, 2019, Phase II Deployment had 5,853 of such Systems installed. 
Our Phase I Deployment and Phase II Deployment segments own and license Systems to theatrical exhibitors and collect VPFs from motion picture studios and distributors, as well as alternative content fees ("ACFs") from alternative content providers and theatrical exhibitors, when content is shown on exhibitors' screens. We have licensed the necessary software and technology solutions to the exhibitor and have facilitated the industry's transition from analog (film) to digital cinema. As part of the Phase I Deployment of our Systems, we have agreements with nine motion picture studios and certain smaller independent studios and exhibitors, allowing us to collect VPFs and ACFs when content is shown in theatres, in exchange for having facilitated and financed the deployment of Systems. Phase 1 DC has agreements with 20 theatrical exhibitors that license our Systems in order to show digital content distributed by the motion picture studios and other providers, including Content & Entertainment, which is described below. 
Beginning in December 2015, certain of our cinema equipment began to reach the conclusion of their 10-year deployment payment period with certain distributors and, therefore, Virtual Print Fee ("VPF") revenues ceased to be recognized on such Systems, related to such distributors. Furthermore, because the Phase I Deployment installation period ended in November 2007, a majority of the VPF revenue associated with the Phase I Deployment Systems has ended. As of March 31, 2019, all of our 3,480 systems from the Phase I Deployment phase of our cinema equipment business segment had ceased to earn a significant portion of VPF revenue from certain major studios, although various other studios, consisting mostly of small independent studios, will continue to pay VPFs through December 2020. We expect to continue to earn such ancillary revenue from the cinema equipment segment through December of 2020; however, such amounts are expected to be significantly less material to our consolidated financial statements. The reduction in VPF revenue on cinema equipment business systems approximately coincided with the conclusion of certain of our non-recourse debt obligations and, therefore, the reduced cash outflows related to such non-recourse debt obligations partially offset the reduced VPF revenue since November 2017.
Under the terms of our standard cinema equipment licensing agreements, exhibitors will continue to have the right to use our Systems through the end of the term of the licensing agreement, after which time, they have the option to: (1) return the Systems to us; (2) renew their license agreement for successive one-year terms; or (3) purchase the Systems from us at fair market value. As permitted by these agreements, we have begun, and expect to continue, to pursue the sale of the Systems to such exhibitors. Such sales were as originally contemplated as the conclusion of the digital cinema deployment plan. Cinedigm

completed the sale of approximately 321 digital projection Systems for an aggregate sales price of approximately $3.7 million during the year ended March 31, 2019.
Our Phase II Deployment segment has entered into digital cinema deployment agreements with eight motion picture studios, and certain smaller independent studios and exhibitors, to distribute digital movie releases to exhibitors equipped with our Systems, for which we and our wholly owned, non-consolidated subsidiary Cinedigm Digital Funding 2, LLC ("CDF2 Holdings") earn VPFs. As of March 31, 2019, our Phase II Deployment segment also entered into master license agreements with 187 exhibitors covering 5,027 screens, whereby the exhibitors agreed to install our Systems. As of March 31, 2019, we had 5,027 Phase 2 DC Systems installed, including 3,596 screens under the exhibitor-buyer structure (“Exhibitor-Buyer”), 1,431 screens covering 23 exhibitors through CDF2. 
Exhibitors paid us an installation fee of up to $2.0 thousand per screen out of the VPFs collected by our Services segment. We manage the billing and collection of VPFs and remit to exhibitors all VPFs collected, less an administrative fee of approximately 10%. For Phase 2 DC Systems we own and finance on a non-recourse basis, we typically received a similar installation fee of up to $2.0 thousand per screen and an ongoing administrative fee of approximately 10% of VPFs collected. We have recorded no debt, property and equipment, financing costs or depreciation in connection with Systems covered under the Exhibitor-Buyer Structure and CDF2 Holdings. 
VPFs are earned pursuant to contracts with movie studios and distributors, whereby amounts are payable to our Phase I and Phase II deployment businesses according to fixed fee schedules, when movies distributed by studios are displayed in movie theatres using our installed Systems. One VPF is payable to us upon the initial booking of a movie, for every movie title displayed per System. Therefore, the amount of VPF revenue that we earn depends on the number of unique movie titles released and displayed using our Systems. Our Phase II Deployment segment earns VPF revenues only for Systems that it owns.
Our Phase II Deployment agreements with distributors require payment of VPFs for ten years from the date that each system is installed; however, we may no longer collect VPFs once “cost recoupment,” as defined in the contracts with movie studios and distributors, is achieved. Cost recoupment will occur once the cumulative VPFs and other cash receipts collected by us have equaled the total of all cash outflows, including the purchase price of all Systems, all financing costs, all “overhead and ongoing costs,” as defined, subject to maximum agreed upon amounts during the four-year roll-out period and thereafter. Furthermore, if cost recoupment occurs before the end of the eighth contract year, a one-time “cost recoupment bonus” is payable to us by the studios. Cash flows, net of expenses, received by our Phase II Deployment business, following the achievement of cost recoupment, must be returned to the distributors on a pro-rata basis. At this time, we cannot estimate the timing or probability of the achievement of cost recoupment.
Customers
No single Phase I or Phase II customer comprised more than 10% of our consolidated revenue.
Seasonality
Revenues earned by our Cinema Equipment Business segment from the collection of VPFs from motion picture studios are seasonal, coinciding with the timing of releases of movies by the motion picture studios. Generally, motion picture studios release the most marketable movies during the summer and the winter holiday season. The unexpected emergence of a hit movie during other periods can alter the traditional trend. The timing of movie releases can have a significant effect on our results of operations, and the results of one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the next quarter or any other quarter. The seasonality of motion picture exhibition; however, has become less pronounced as the motion picture studios are releasing movies somewhat more evenly throughout the year.

SERVICES
Our Services segment provides monitoring, billing, collection, verification and other management services to Phase 1 DC and Phase 2 DC as well as to exhibitor-buyers who purchase their own equipment. Our Services segment provides such services to the 3,480 screens in the Phase I Deployment for a monthly service fee equal to 5% of the VPFs earned by Phase 1 DC and an incentive service fee equal to 2.5% of the VPFs earned by Phase 1 DC. The Services segment also provides services to the 5,853 Phase II Systems deployed, for which we typically receive a monthly fee of approximately 10% of the VPFs earned by Phase 2 DC. The total Phase II service fees are subject to an annual limitation under the terms of our agreements with motion picture studios and are determined based upon the respective Exhibitor-Buyer Structure, KBC or CDF2 agreements. Unpaid service fees in any period remain an obligation to Phase 2 DC in the cost recoupment framework. Such fees are not recognized as income or accrued as an asset on our balance sheet given the uncertainty of the receipt and the timing thereof as future movie release and bookings are not known. Service fees are accrued and recognized only on deployed Phase II Systems. As a result, the annual service fee limitation is variable until these fees are paid.
In February 2013, we (i) assigned to our wholly owned subsidiary, Cinedigm DC Holdings LLC (“DC Holdings ”), the right and obligation to service the digital cinema projection systems from the Phase I Deployment and certain systems that were part of the Phase II Deployment, (ii) delegated to DC Holdings the right and obligation to service certain other systems that were part of the Phase II Deployment and (iii) assigned to DC Holdings the right to receive servicing fees from the Phase I and Phase II Deployments. We also transferred to DC Holdings certain of our operational staff whose responsibilities and activities relate solely to the operation of the servicing business and to provide DC Holdings with the right to use the supporting software and other intellectual property associated with the operation of the servicing business. 
Our Services segment also has international servicing partnerships in Australia and New Zealand with the Independent Cinema Association of Australia and is currently servicing 530 screens as of March 31, 2019. 
Competition 
Our Services segment faces limited competition domestically in its digital cinema services business as the major Hollywood movie studios have only signed digital cinema deployment agreements with five entities, including us, and the deployment period in North America is now complete. Competitors include: Digital Cinema Implementation Partners (“DCIP”), a joint venture of three large exhibitors (Regal Entertainment Group, AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. and Cinemark Holdings, Inc.) focused on managing the conversions of those three exhibitors; Sony Digital Cinema, to support the deployment of Sony projection equipment; Christie Digital USA, Inc., to support the deployment of Christie equipment; and GDC, Inc., to support the deployment of GDC equipment. We have a significantly greater market share than all other competitors except for the DCIP consortium, which services approximately 18,000 total screens representing its consortium members.
As we expand our servicing platform internationally, additional competitors beyond those listed above consist of Arts Alliance, Inc., a leading digital cinema servicer focused on the European markets, and GDC, as well as other potential local start-ups seeking to service a specific international market. We typically seek to partner with a leading local entity to combine our efficient servicing infrastructure and strong studio relationships with the necessary local market expertise and exhibitor relationships.
ENVIRONMENTAL 
The nature of our business does not subject us to environmental laws in any material manner. 
EMPLOYEES 
As of March 31, 2019, we had 104 employees, with 6 part-time and 98 full-time, of which 20 are in sales and marketing, 37 are in operations, and 41 are in executive, finance, technology and administration functions.
