ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview

We are a leading provider of high-power semiconductor and fiber lasers. Our lasers are changing not only the way things are made but also the things that can be made. We design, develop and manufacture the critical elements of our lasers, and we believe our vertically integrated business model enables us to rapidly introduce innovative products, control our costs and protect our intellectual property. In 2018, we sold our products to over 350 customers worldwide in three primary markets: industrial, microfabrication, and aerospace and defense.
Our semiconductor lasers are the industry's most brilliant and serve as the core building block of all of our products. Our vertical integration enables us to incorporate our semiconductor lasers into our proprietary fiber lasers and also to sell our semiconductor lasers as standalone solutions. We offer differentiated high-power fiber lasers that provide our customers with significant advantages over legacy fiber lasers in the areas of programmability, serviceability and reliability. By engaging with our customers early in their system design cycle and utilizing our platform-based approach to product design, we are able to offer semiconductor and fiber laser solutions optimized to meet our customers' requirements.
Semiconductor and fiber lasers are displacing legacy lasers and non-laser energy sources across a wide range of applications in the industrial, microfabrication, and aerospace and defense markets. In the industrial market, high-power semiconductor and fiber lasers have enabled the creation of next-generation industrial systems to perform manufacturing processes such as cutting, welding and drilling, as well as advanced manufacturing techniques such as additive manufacturing. In the microfabrication market, many of the critical microscale features incorporated into products in the automotive, electronics, medical, semiconductor and other markets are made commercially viable by the precise power delivery of lasers. In the aerospace and defense market, high-power semiconductor and fiber lasers are currently used across a wide range of mission critical applications, such as defending aircraft against missiles, and are enabling next-generation defense systems.

The growth of the high-power fiber laser market has been driven by a significant reduction in cost per brilliant watt and a substantial increase in the power output of semiconductor lasers, at a rate that we believe is similar to Moore's Law for integrated circuits. Our global customers include Cincinnati Inc., DMG Mori, Han's Laser Technology Group Co. Ltd. and Suzhou Quick Laser Technology Co. in industrial, MKS Instruments and Samsung in microfabrication, and BAE and Raytheon in aerospace and defense.

Industry Overview
Legacy Lasers
A laser converts electrical energy into optical energy, or light, that can be concentrated and shaped to create a powerful beam that can cut, manipulate, melt and vaporize materials. The two main parts of a laser are an energy source and a gain medium. Gas and crystal lasers, named for the materials used as the gain medium, were the initial types of lasers used in industrial applications. While gas and crystal lasers are an improvement over mechanical and other non-laser techniques for material processing, they have various deficiencies, which may include lower reliability, the need for costly cooling and more frequent maintenance, less desirable beam quality, energy inefficiency, and lack of programmability and serviceability.
5

Fiber Lasers
In a fiber laser, the gain medium is an optical fiber infused with rare earth elements, and the energy source is one or more semiconductor lasers. The term "semiconductor laser" can describe an individual semiconductor laser chip or a product that combines an array of such chips into a more powerful device, which is typically the approach used to build a fiber laser. Semiconductor lasers vary based upon the material used as the gain medium, the spectrum of light generated, the beam shape, the power yielded, the brilliance, as well as other characteristics. Substantial improvements in the power, brilliance, cost, reliability and efficiency of semiconductor lasers have been foundational to the improved performance and cost competitiveness of fiber lasers.
Power and brilliance are critical measures of laser performance. Both laser power and laser brilliance can vary dramatically. For example, a single semiconductor laser chip used in a handheld laser pointer generates a fraction of a watt of power, whereas high-power semiconductor laser chips used in a high-power fiber laser can generate as much as 20 watts of power per chip. The output power of a high-power fiber laser, using an array of high-power semiconductor lasers amplified via specialty fiber, can be thousands of watts, or kilowatts. Laser brilliance is a measure of how much power a laser generates over a given emission area and the rate of divergence of its beam. Therefore, two lasers emitting the same power but with different emission areas or beam divergences will have different levels of brilliance. Semiconductor laser brilliance is critical for scaling power in fiber lasers, as high-power fiber lasers require efficient aggregation of the output power of many semiconductor lasers into a single fiber.
Over the past few decades, the cost per brilliant watt produced by semiconductor lasers has fallen dramatically as a result of improved laser design and production techniques and increased production volumes. This has led to the rapid adoption of fiber lasers in a variety of markets. We believe a parallel can be drawn to the proliferation of integrated circuits as their processing power increased while the cost per transistor fell. This advancement is defined as Moore's Law, which is an observation that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years.
Fiber lasers address many of the disadvantages of legacy gas and crystal lasers. Improvements in performance and cost of production over the last decade have fueled a dramatic expansion in the use of fiber lasers in a number of markets.

Advantages of fiber lasers over legacy gas and crystal lasers include:

• | Superior beam quality. Fiber lasers can generate higher power, more precise and more stable output beams. This enables simpler and lower-cost beam delivery optics, higher performance for the laser process and better overall system reliability. 


• | Superior flexibility. The simplicity of the architecture of a fiber laser enables an end user to optimize the laser to the precise needs of a given application by adjusting beam power, frequency and shape. 


• | Lower total cost of ownership. Fiber lasers tend to be more durable, reliable, energy efficient, stable and tolerant of longer operating cycles than legacy lasers. Fiber lasers are generally less costly to operate and repair than legacy lasers, and require less regular maintenance. These characteristics can result in a lower total cost of fiber lasers relative to legacy lasers over their operating lifetimes. 


• | Smaller size and easier operability. Fiber lasers generally are smaller than legacy lasers and can be located remotely from the workpiece by virtue of a convenient beam delivery fiber, potentially simplifying the tool and facility requirements. Locating the laser system away from the workpiece alleviates factory floor congestion. Moreover, the flexibility and small size of the beam delivery fiber is more adaptable to the physical attributes of the surface being processed and can often reach areas of a surface that legacy systems cannot. Fiber lasers are also easier to operate, with fewer parts and a reduced need for physical adjustments by operators. 

Our Advancements in High-Power Fiber Lasers

We believe our high-power fiber lasers offer significant advancements over legacy fiber lasers in terms of programmability, serviceability and reliability. These advantages are a function of our vertically integrated business model, proprietary semiconductor laser technology, unique high-power fiber laser architectures and advanced in-house manufacturing methods.
Programmability

We believe the programmability of our lasers is a distinctive feature that makes them well-suited for use with versatile, multi-function machine tools in a wide range of applications. The programmability of our lasers improves the materials processing speed and quality provided by the systems into which they are incorporated. Moreover, the programmability of our lasers enables our OEM customers to develop machine tools that can be utilized across multiple applications, thereby allowing end users to replace multiple tools inside a factory with a single, more flexible tool. Our Corona fiber lasers incorporate proprietary all-fiber technology that allows our customers to program the output beam spot size and shape, while retaining the full operating power of 
6

the fiber laser, without the complexity, cost, or performance trade-offs that accompany other beam shaping methods. All our fiber lasers incorporate proprietary control hardware and software that provide end users with significant flexibility to optimize not only output power but also the optical waveform (temporal beam shape). These advantages allow our customers to program our laser via a simple interface that modifies different beam variables during its use in a production cycle to improve the throughput and quality of the processed parts.
Serviceability

Our fiber lasers are designed to be serviced quickly on site and by our customers. Most service activities can be completed without shipping the laser back to a repair depot and often without the need for our direct involvement. In contrast, end users operating machine tools built with legacy fiber lasers that require the machine tool manufacturer to coordinate the service activity with the laser provider can experience longer disruptions in their operations when the lasers need servicing. With legacy lasers and competing fiber lasers, a service activity necessitating the removal of the laser from the machine tool on the production floor and its transportation to a remote service depot for service and repair can lead to longer operational downtime. The architecture of our fiber lasers enables them to be serviced on site, generally in less than two hours, often eliminating the need for the end customers to have spare lasers in reserve. As a result, end users benefit from significantly higher production uptime, and our customers benefit by the ability to manage the end-user experience without having to rely upon a laser manufacturer representative for ongoing service.
Reliability
Our fiber lasers incorporate advanced components and proprietary designs that protect our lasers from operating conditions that can cause failures in legacy fiber lasers, thereby improving uptime and lowering total operating cost. Many manufacturing environments are hot, humid, dirty and crowded, characteristics that challenge older generations of fiber lasers which need external air conditioning to operate. For instance, even in extremely humid environments, our high-power fiber lasers do not require air conditioning, instead relying on a simple and inexpensive dry air purge to prevent condensation and inoperability. Historically, a failure mode for fiber lasers has been back reflection from reflective materials. Our fiber lasers incorporate proprietary back reflection suppression technology, improving their ability to process highly reflective materials used for next-generation automotive batteries, automotive parts, appliances and many other applications. Our fiber lasers are industry leaders in power stability. We consider the power stability of our fiber lasers to be a particularly important differentiator for advanced and emerging applications, such as additive manufacturing, and in the development of versatile multifunctional machine tools.
Our Market Opportunity
Industrial
The productivity, efficiency and versatility offered by high-power fiber lasers have been critical in making them a key part of the evolution of the industrial ecosystem. Material processing applications, the largest of which is cutting, and others such as welding, cladding, heat treating and additive manufacturing comprise the majority of the industrial laser market. High-power fiber lasers are rapidly replacing gas and other legacy lasers for cutting, due to their significantly faster speed, higher quality and lower cost when used across a wide range of metals. High-power fiber lasers also continue to take market share from non-laser cutting techniques, and are expanding into other applications such as cutting metal tubes and other three-dimensional parts.
The factors driving the utilization of high-power fiber lasers in metal welding applications, including increased speed, quality and cost, are similar to those that have fueled their adoption for metal cutting. Fiber laser welding can be done faster, with deeper penetration, less distortion and lower heat input than traditional methods like arc welding. These advantages have fueled adoption of high-power fiber lasers across the automotive industry where system productivity and versatility are critical. Other metal fabrication industries, such as aerospace, energy and light manufacturing, are also embracing the unique capabilities offered by high-power fiber lasers for welding applications as they seek improved production efficiencies and higher levels of industrial automation.
In addition to improving traditional manufacturing processes, fiber lasers are also enabling new applications such as metal additive manufacturing. High-power fiber lasers provide the precise power needed to fuse metal powders into intricate three-dimensional metal structures. Advancements in laser technology are also enabling manufacturers to produce ever-larger parts with more complex geometries at faster speeds and lower costs.

Microfabrication

Microfabrication refers to the process of creating three-dimensional microscale structures, typically by ablating, annealing, etching and drilling. Many of the microscale features incorporated into products in the automotive, electronics, medical, semiconductor and other markets are made commercially viable by the precise power delivery of lasers. Preferences for brighter, more vibrant displays in mobile phones, tablets and televisions, and the desire for thinner products with improved battery life and energy efficiency are placing greater importance on the need for components that are smaller, more robust and less expensive, which we believe will drive demand for lasers.
Aerospace and Defense

Lasers are used today in a variety of aerospace and defense applications, such as range finding, imaging and directed energy defense systems. Directed energy defense systems utilize concentrated electrical or optical energy rather than chemical or kinetic force as a means to incapacitate, damage, disable or destroy. Compared to conventional weapons, directed energy weapons using high-power fiber lasers offer ultra-precise targeting, low cost per use and a nearly unlimited magazine. Over the past decade, directed energy technologies have improved steadily, culminating in a series of successful demonstrations of significantly higher power, multi-kilowatt systems. Systems using high-power fiber lasers have shown the highest degree of operational viability.
Our Competitive Strengths

We believe the following strengths will allow us to maintain and extend our leadership position:
Innovative semiconductor laser technology.    We design and manufacture the industry's most brilliant semiconductor lasers. Our semiconductor lasers serve as the core building block of all of our solutions, and are incorporated into our fiber lasers.

Additionally, we have designed proprietary back reflection suppression technologies into our high-power fiber lasers, which allows for greater uptime.

Customizable high-power semiconductor and fiber laser solutions based on a scalable platform.    We offer a scalable platform that is enabled by our extensive library of proprietary semiconductor and fiber laser designs, packaging options and specialty optical fibers. While we sell standard products for many applications, we primarily target higher value, high-volume opportunities that require deep collaboration, solution customization and deep integration into our OEM customers' systems. As a result of our platform-based approach, we are able to quickly and simply configure solutions that are optimized to the particular requirements of our OEM customers. Our lasers are designed into systems with stringent specifications for quality, performance and reliability, and our lasers are often mission critical in these applications.

Vertically integrated business model.    We design, develop and manufacture the critical elements of our high-power semiconductor and fiber lasers, including semiconductor laser chips and optical fiber. Our control and execution of nearly all steps of the manufacturing process allow us to optimize product quality, protect our intellectual property, effectively manage costs and minimize queue time between each process step. We believe that being vertically integrated also enables us to sell at the level of integration our customers desire, at highly competitive price points and at attractive profit margins.

Our Strategy
Our objective is to be the leading provider of high-power semiconductor and fiber lasers to the industrial, microfabrication, and aerospace and defense markets and, in the future, to leverage our core competencies to expand into other markets with similar performance requirements. The key elements of our strategy are:
Increase sales.    We intend to leverage our leading position in high-power semiconductor and fiber lasers and our global footprint in key geographies to increase our sales. Continued displacement of legacy lasers and non-laser energy sources by high-power semiconductor and fiber lasers in a wide range of applications should enable us to increase sales from existing customers and to generate sales from new customers. We believe the quality and performance of our lasers and our innovative approach of tailoring our platform-based high-power semiconductor and fiber laser solutions to the specific needs of our customers will allow us to grow our market share.

Enable new applications.    Our innovations are making our semiconductor and fiber lasers more powerful, programmable, reliable and affordable, which is driving their adoption in existing applications as well as enabling new ones that were not previously commercially viable. For instance, the power, precision and programmability of our lasers are enabling a new class of additive manufacturing tools in the industrial market and are supporting commercialization of next-generation directed energy defense systems in the aerospace and defense market. We expect the continued improvement in the features, performance and total cost of ownership of our lasers will drive their adoption in an expanding array of applications and end markets.
Further reduce costs of our high-power semiconductor and fiber lasers.    We have a track record of reducing the cost of our high-power semiconductor and fiber lasers. We anticipate continuing to reduce the cost of our products by developing new semiconductor laser chips, semiconductor laser and fiber laser architectures, introducing new packaging technologies and increasing the use of automation in our manufacturing and packaging facilities.
Products

We design and manufacture a range of high-power semiconductor and fiber lasers. Our products are typically integrated into laser systems or manufacturing tools built by our customers.
Semiconductor Lasers

Our semiconductor lasers serve as the core building block of our products and are deeply integrated with our OEM customers' systems used in applications in the industrial, microfabrication, and aerospace and defense markets. We sell high-power semiconductor lasers with a broad range of power levels, wavelengths and output fiber sizes. Our semiconductor lasers offer the industry's highest brilliance, and we believe are among the industry's most reliable.
Fiber Lasers
We offer programmable, serviceable and reliable high-power fiber lasers primarily for use in industrial, microfabrication, and aerospace and defense applications. Our fiber lasers enable fast, high-quality and efficient processing of materials. The programmability and wide operating range of our fiber lasers makes them easy for our customers to use and expands their applicability. For example, in some cases, a single Corona fiber laser with the ability to program the size and shape of its output beam can take the place of several less-flexible lasers. We have also designed our fiber lasers to enable a tool integrator or end user to perform common field service activities on-site, which results in higher machine uptime, lower cost of ownership and an improved customer experience.

     From time to time, we develop products to address specific applications for select customers that require custom integration of our semiconductor laser chip and advanced optical assemblies. By their nature, these are typically sole-source designs with long product cycles. We also sell active and passive specialty optical fiber to select customers.
Technology

We believe we have developed strong, defensible technologies essential to the design and manufacture of semiconductor laser chips, fiber-coupled semiconductor laser packages, optical fiber and fiber lasers.
The Importance of Laser Brilliance
Laser brilliance can be thought of as the measure of how efficiently photons are integrated to scale power in semiconductor lasers and fiber lasers. A brilliant laser is one that emits a high level of power relative to the surface area and rate of divergence of its beam, and by increasing the brilliance of a laser we are able to increase its power scaling capability efficiently and cost effectively. Increasing power by increasing brilliance is more challenging than simply increasing the emitting surface area of the laser due to high optical power densities. Our lasers can endure extraordinary optical power densities because of our proprietary passivation technique applied to the emitting facet of the laser chip, operating reliably for extended operating cycles and with long operating lifetimes.
10

Semiconductor Laser Chips
The core building block of our technology is a compound semiconductor laser chip manufactured from a gallium arsenide wafer. We have developed advanced metal-organic chemical vapor deposition processes that yield high-quality semiconductor material with low-defect density and high uniformity. We believe that our semiconductor laser chips offer industry-leading brilliance as a result of proprietary and trade-secret protected semiconductor laser chip design, laser cavity design and facet passivation.
Semiconductor Lasers
We patented our multiplexed single-chip architecture for high-power semiconductor laser packaging. Our experience with multiplexed single-chip architecture gives us a performance advantage in multiple critical categories, including power, brilliance, efficiency and reliability. Our extensive experience in optical alignment and package design enables us to overcome many complex thermal and beam stability challenges to produce highly reliable semiconductor lasers.
Optical Fiber
Our active optical fibers are used as the gain medium in which lasing or amplification of light occurs in our fiber lasers. Our active fibers consist of an inner core that is doped with rare-earth ions and an outer core of un-doped glass for guiding the power delivered from our semiconductor lasers.
We utilize a proprietary and patented process for making our fibers, which we call Direct Nanoparticle Deposition, or DND. We have been developing and improving our DND technology for more than a decade. Our DND process enables simultaneous, single-step deposition of all elements in the active fiber and provides high compositional uniformity and independent control of refractive-index and doping profiles. Our DND technology enables high doping concentration, which allows for higher power and efficiency and shorter fiber length.
Our passive optical fibers route and deliver the optical energy generated in our semiconductor lasers and fiber lasers. Our passive fibers are designed to match the optical guiding properties of our rare earth-doped fibers, enabling compatibility with and low-loss splicing of our active fiber within our fiber lasers.
Fiber Lasers
Our fiber lasers use an active fiber that is doped with a rare-earth element to amplify the light from multiple semiconductor laser chips into a much higher brilliance laser beam. The power available from our fiber lasers has increased significantly due to the increase in power of our semiconductor laser chips and advances in our multi-chip semiconductor laser architecture, our DND active fibers and our proprietary fiber laser architectures. We scale power by both combining the outputs of multiple fiber lasers and by increasing the output power of our individual fiber laser.
Our fiber lasers offer many features, including all-fiber programmable beam sizes and shapes, programmable waveforms, high-speed waveform modulation capabilities, hardware back-reflection suppression, operability in harsh environments, quick and easy serviceability and industry-leading power stability. The resulting performance and quality provide significant advantages over alternative laser and non-laser solutions for existing applications, and support the commercial feasibility of an increasing number of new applications. We intend to continue to aggressively advance our fiber laser, semiconductor laser and active fiber technologies to further improve our performance, programmability, serviceability and reliability advantages.
Research and Development
Our research and development team is comprised of experts in semiconductor physics, chemistry, material science, electrical engineering, optical engineering, and mechanical engineering. Our research and development activities include innovation of existing products that enhance performance at reduced cost, and the design of new products that address select market opportunities. While we seek to improve our products on all operating characteristics, we believe we lead the market in terms of semiconductor laser chip brilliance. We work closely with customers to develop products to meet customer application and performance needs, making our research and development efforts more efficient. We also benefit from our vertically integrated business model, as we are able to conduct design cycles more rapidly through control of the full production process. 
We intend to continue our commitment to research and development and to introduce new products, solutions and complementary products that would allow us to maintain and strengthen our competitive position.
11

Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as customary contractual protections with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants that contribute to our material intellectual property.
As of December 31, 2018, we have 106 issued U.S. patents, 121 pending U.S. patents, 114 issued foreign patents, 60 pending foreign patents, 52 pending Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) patent applications, and 14 pending European Patent Office (EPO) patent applications covering elements of semiconductor and fiber laser manufacturing and design, optical, fiber and circuit design and waveguide design and fabrication.  Our currently issued patents are set to expire from 2021 to 2037.
Sales and Marketing
We market and sell our products to global OEMs primarily through our direct sales force located in the United States, China, South Korea, Germany and Finland. To supplement our direct sales team, we have contracts in place with several independent sales representatives and distributors in Asia and Europe. We selected these independent representatives and distributors based on their ability to provide effective field sales, marketing communications and technical support for select products and markets in target geographies. Our sales and marketing efforts are conducted through an integrated process that involves our direct sales force, Field Applications Engineers, or FAEs, customer service representatives and our senior management team.
Our FAEs work closely with our sales and engineering teams to provide product development support to our OEM customers. Through close collaboration, our FAEs develop deep relationships with our OEM customers, providing us with unique insight into their product roadmaps and allowing us to identify business opportunities at an early stage. Our integrated sales and marketing strategy enables us to be highly responsive and successful in navigating each customer's unique and oftentimes complex design qualification process.
We maintain customer support and field service staff in our major markets in the United States, Europe, China, South Korea, and India. We work closely with customers to service equipment and train customers to use and repair our products and explore additional applications for our technologies. We plan to expand our support and field service footprint, particularly in locations where business volume requires local service capabilities.
We sell to and support over 350 customers worldwide. A few customers drive a significant portion of our revenues. In the aggregate, our top ten customers accounted for approximately 56%, 61% and 60% of our revenues in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Suzhou Quick Laser Technology Co., Ltd accounted for 13%, 14% and 11% of our revenues for the years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition, Raytheon Company accounted for 10% of our revenues in 2016. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our revenues in 2018, 2017 or 2016.
Competition
The industries in which we operate have significant price and technological competition. We compete not only with companies providing semiconductor and fiber lasers, but with companies offering conventional laser or non-laser solutions for the applications we target. Some of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater financial, research and development, managerial, sales, service and marketing resources and larger installed customer bases than we do.
 We compete with companies that offer fiber lasers and other lasers such as BWT Beijing Ltd., Coherent, Inc., II-VI Incorporated, IPG Photonics Corporation, Lumentum Holdings Inc., Maxphotonics Co., Ltd., Raycus Fiber Laser Technologies Co. Ltd. and Trumpf GmbH + Co. KG. We also compete with widely used non-laser production methods, such as plasma cutting, water-jet cutting and resistance welding. 
Manufacturing, Sources of Supply and Raw Materials
We manufacture, package and test the critical elements of our high-power semiconductor and fiber lasers, including semiconductor laser chips and optical fiber in-house. Our vertically integrated business model enables us to control and protect our proprietary technologies and process knowledge, and ensures our supply of critical components. Controlling and executing nearly all steps of the manufacturing process provides us several advantages, including:

• | protection of our intellectual property;


• | ability to maintain high product quality;


• | accelerated production cycles, improving our delivery times and responsiveness to customer requests;

12


• | ability to rapidly integrate improvements into our manufacturing process; and


• | efficient management of production costs.

We outsource components and materials when we feel that a specific component, by itself, does not provide a sufficient competitive advantage to warrant investment in the capital and human resources necessary for its manufacture. We work with our suppliers in these situations to ensure consistent quality and delivery performance. In many cases, components are custom manufactured for us based on our proprietary specifications.
We manufacture our products in facilities in Vancouver, Washington, Hillsboro, Oregon, Lohja, Finland and Shanghai, China. We manufacture certain electrical-optical components in our Vancouver, Washington, Shanghai, China and Hillsboro, Oregon facilities. We maintain our fiber operations and manufacture fiber in Finland, where we are fully vertically integrated.
We purchase raw materials used to manufacture our products and other components, such as semiconductor wafer substrates, fiber laser chip packages, optics and other materials, from single or limited-source suppliers. We typically purchase our materials through purchase orders or agreed-upon terms and conditions and we do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with many of these suppliers. To mitigate raw material supply risks, we take a variety of actions such as second source qualification, accumulation of safety stock and vendor surveillance.
We believe our existing manufacturing facilities are adequate to meet current anticipated demand. If additional capacity is needed, we believe that such capacity will be available on commercially reasonable terms.
Backlog
Backlog consists of purchase orders for products that we expect to ship within the next twelve months. We had backlog of $38.0 million and $44.6 million as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Our backlog is not necessarily indicative of revenues for any specific future period due to possible order cancellations or deferrals, and shipping or acceptance delays.
Quality Assurance
Our products are mission critical to our customers, and the superior performance and reliability of our lasers is crucial to our competitive strategy. To ensure our products perform to the high standards that we and our customers demand, we have established rigorous quality assurance protocols that are compliant with state-of-the-art industry standards. Our Vancouver, Washington, Hillsboro, Oregon, Lohja, Finland, and Shanghai, China facilities are ISO 9001:2015 registered. Our team has the expertise in quality control, manufacturing and process engineering necessary to produce highly reliable products that consistently meet customer expectations.
Regulation
We are subject to significant regulation by local, state, federal and international laws in all jurisdictions in which we operate. Compliance to these requirements can be costly and time consuming. We believe that our operations, products, services and actions substantially comply with applicable regulations in all jurisdictions. However, the risk of non-compliance cannot be eliminated and therefore there is no assurance that future costs related to these regulations will not be incurred. There is also the possibility that regulations will be retroactively applied, interpreted or applied differently to our operations, products, services and actions which will require significant time and resources.
Lasers sold in the United States are classified as Laser Products under the applicable rules and regulations of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, or CDRH, of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. CDRH regulations require a self-certification procedure pursuant to which a manufacturer must submit a filing to the CDRH with respect to each product incorporating a laser device, make periodic reports of sales and purchases and comply with product labeling standards, product safety and design features and informational requirements. Outside of the United States, most countries reference the International IEC60825-1 standard in their regulations, and our products are classified as Class 4. Our products are registered with the CDRH, but it is the responsibility of our customers to certify their product to CDRH and IEC60825 requirements.
Environmental
Our products contain hazardous substances that are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws governing environmental health and safety, including those relating to the purchase, transportation, storage, use, disposal, land-usage and human exposure. We believe that our operations are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable environmental laws 
13

and regulations, including reporting requirements. In addition, we have put in place a wide range of safety training and internal controls regarding the handling of such hazardous substances.
Occupational Health and Safety
All of our operations are also subject to regulation by local, state, federal and international worker health and safety laws in all jurisdictions in which we operate. For instance, in the United States, we are required to comply with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations and the applicable, more stringent Oregon and Washington requirements. Typical safety hazards are in the areas of laser, electrical and hazardous materials, whereas health hazards tend to be related to hazardous materials and ergonomics. We have designed controls and engage in continual improvement programs in order to better address these risks.
Export
Certain products of ours are subject to the Export Administration Regulations, administered by the Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry Security, which require that we obtain an export license before we can export products or technology to specified countries. Additionally, some of our products are subject to International Traffic in Arms Regulations, a United States regulatory regime to restrict and control the export of defense and military related technologies to safeguard U.S. national security and further U.S. foreign policy objectives. Other products of ours are controlled by similar laws in other jurisdictions. We maintain an export compliance program staffed by dedicated personnel under which we screen export transactions against current lists of restricted exports, destinations and end users with the objective of carefully managing export-related decisions and transactions and shipping logistics and ensuring compliance with these rules. We believe we have obtained all export licenses required for our shipments subject to these regulations.
