Overview 
 We are a Phase 2 clinical stage gene therapy company focused on developing potentially curative ex vivo lentiviral-based gene therapies to treat patients with rare diseases following a single dose treatment regimen. Our gene therapies employ hematopoietic stem cells that are harvested from the patient and then modified with lentiviral vectors to insert a functional copy of the gene that is defective in the target disease. We believe that our approach, which is designed to transform stem cells from patients into therapeutic products, has the potential to provide curative benefit for a range of diseases. Our initial focus is on a group of rare genetic diseases referred to as lysosomal storage diseases, some of which today are primarily managed with enzyme replacement therapies, or ERTs. These lysosomal storage diseases have well-understood biologies, identified patient populations, established standards of care yet with significant unmet needs, and represent large market opportunities with approximately $4.0 billion in worldwide net sales in 2017. 
 Our initial pipeline is comprised of four lentiviral-based gene therapy programs, including AVR-RD-01 for the treatment of Fabry disease, AVR-RD-02 for the treatment of Gaucher disease, AVR-RD-04 for the treatment of cystinosis and AVR-RD-03 for the treatment of Pompe disease. AVR-RD-01 is currently being evaluated in an investigator-sponsored Phase 1 clinical trial and a company-sponsored Phase 2 clinical trial and a total of seven patients have been dosed across both trials as of March 15, 2019. To date, AVR-RD-01 has demonstrated significant increased enzyme activity, with plasma α-galactosidase A, or AGA, enzyme activity levels in the first four patients treated in the investigator-sponsored Phase 1 clinical trial and the first patient in our company-sponsored Phase 2 clinical trial, for whom we have provided interim data, increasing above the range for males with classical Fabry disease, defined as less than 1 nmol/hr/ml. The fifth patient in the investigator-sponsored Phase 1 clinical trial of AVR-RD-01 was dosed on February 21, 2019, and we do not expect any further enrollment in this investigator-sponsored clinical trial. On December 13, 2018, the second patient was dosed in our company-sponsored Phase 2 clinical trial of AVR-RD-01. In addition, Phase 1/2 clinical trials for both AVR-RD-02 and AVR-RD-04 are being planned and we expect patients will be dosed in the second half of 2019. 
 Since its first clinical use in 2003, lentiviral-based gene therapy has been observed to be well-tolerated in third parties clinical trials for rare diseases such as beta thalassemia, adrenoleukodystrophy, or ALD, metachromatic leukodystrophy, or MLD, and ADA-SCID. The use of ex vivo lentiviral-based gene therapies was initially restricted primarily to the most acutely severe diseases where the risks of the typical requirement for ablating the patients bone marrow, which significantly impairs those patients immune systems, had a clinically justifiable risk/benefit profile due to the novelty of the approach and the severity of the diseases. To date, over 200 patients have been treated with lentiviral-based gene therapies in third parties and our rare disease clinical trials, and we believe the technology can be developed for other serious conditions based on a rigorous risk/benefit assessment. The ablation procedure, also known as the conditioning regimen, is an inherent part of the ex vivo gene therapy treatment procedure and is administered prior to the gene therapy. The more intensive the conditioning regimen, the greater the risk of toxicity. However, we believe the risk of toxicity can be managed through utilization of therapeutic drug monitoring, or TDM. We are refining our approach to conditioning to use a single-agent, myeloablative conditioning regimen administered in conjunction with TDM, which is designed to permit patients to receive appropriate levels of conditioning to promote long-term engraftment while seeking to lessen toxicity. Such an approach could potentially allow the conditioning regimen to be performed during a limited hospital stay or potentially through an outpatient procedure, on a case-by-case basis as may be directed by the patients physician. We believe our approach, utilizing a single myeloablative conditioning agent, coupled 
 
1 


  with TDM, has the potential to extend the reach of our gene therapies to a broad range of diseases as first-line therapies. Our goal is to broaden the applicability of lentiviral-based gene therapy by initially targeting diseases with tractable gene mutations, well-understood biology and that benefit from the sustained systemic delivery of an active protein. 
 We are initially targeting rare lysosomal storage diseases in which current standard of care provides the mechanistic proof that the enzymes or proteins produced endogenously following treatment with our gene therapies can offer benefit to patients. Typically, in lysosomal storage diseases, a gene mutation results in the deficiency or malfunctioning of an enzyme or other protein. This results in the inability of lysosomes to properly process cellular byproducts. As a result, these byproducts accumulate to toxic levels in the bodys cells and, in turn, disrupt the function of multiple tissues and organs. Fabry disease, Gaucher disease and Pompe disease are currently primarily managed by bi-weekly, multi-hour infusions with ERTs that seek to exogenously replace the missing enzyme. However, most ERTs typically only remain in the plasma for a short period of time and thus are not ideal because they are only dosed every two weeks. These existing therapies manage, rather than cure, the underlying diseases and, as a result, patients continue to have disease progression. Further, the frequent, periodic and life-long dosing schedule required for ERTs results in significant costs for the healthcare system and is burdensome for the patient. 
 We believe our gene therapies leverage the well-understood mechanism of ERTs by transforming a patients own cells into a drug product that enables the patient to express functional enzyme or other protein and mirror the biology seen in an otherwise healthy individual. We believe that a single dose of our gene therapies may provide meaningful life-long benefit to these patients and potentially halt the progression of these diseases while also providing significant health economic advantages. 
 Our programs leverage years of extensive preclinical and early clinical research by leading researchers, as well as our internal research and ongoing clinical efforts. The status of our initial lentiviral-based gene therapy programs is reflected below. 
 


Our lead product candidate, AVR-RD-01 for the treatment of Fabry disease, is derived from hematopoietic stem cells to which the gene encoding AGA is added in an ex vivo process using a lentiviral vector. In an ongoing investigator-sponsored Phase 1 clinical trial of patients with Fabry disease, AVR-RD-01 has been observed to be well-tolerated and has led to the production of active AGA enzyme in the first four patients treated for whom we have provided interim data. In all four patients, the level of AGA enzyme activity began to rise from nearly undetectable levels before treatment to levels above the range for males with classical Fabry disease. In this clinical trial, the protocol provides that ERT for these patients is suspended one month prior to receiving AVR-RD-01 and ERT is then resumed one month after the AVR-RD-01 treatment and continued at bi-weekly intervals. After the 18-month follow-up visit for the first patient, the investigator team for the trial recommended, and the patient consented, to discontinue the regular bi-weekly treatment with ERT and the patient remains off ERT as of 22 months post-treatment with AVR-RD-01. Additionally, the third patient in this clinical trial discontinued ERT one month prior to receiving AVR-RD-01 and voluntarily elected not to resume ERT. This patient remains off ERT as of six months post-treatment with AVR-RD-01. The second and fourth patients 
 
2 


  continue to receive concurrent ERT in accordance with the clinical trial protocol. The trial protocol has been amended to allow the investigator team, at their discretion, to discontinue ERT six months after treatment with AVR-RD-01. Plasma AGA enzyme activity levels in the first, second, third and fourth patients remained above the range for males with classical Fabry disease, defined as less than 1 nmol/hr/ml, as of twenty-two months, twelve months, six months and twenty-two days after treatment, respectively. In addition, as of six months after receiving AVR-RD-01, the level of AGA enzyme activity for the first patient in our company-sponsored Phase 2 clinical trial of AVR-RD-01 remained above the range for males with classical Fabry disease. The second patient was dosed in our company-sponsored Phase 2 clinical trial of AVR-RD-01 on December 13, 2018. We recently held a pre-investigational new drug, or IND, meeting with the FDA to discuss the requirements to commence clinical trials in the United States, and we expect to open a U.S. site for our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of AVR-RD-01 in the second half of 2019. 
 Preclinical data for both our Gaucher and cystinosis programs have demonstrated positive results and we expect that patients will begin to be dosed in Phase 1/2 clinical trials for both AVR-RD-02 (Gaucher) and AVR-RD-04 (cystinosis) in 2019. AVR-RD-03 for Pompe disease is currently in early preclinical development. We continue to seek opportunities to expand our approach to other rare and non-rare diseases. We plan to identify and develop future product candidates through our own internal research efforts as well as through collaborations with leading researchers worldwide. 
 Included in our process optimization efforts is the development of a detailed plan for the more cost efficient and scalable manufacturing of our product candidates. We are establishing global manufacturing capabilities to support all aspects of the development and, if approved, the eventual commercialization of our gene therapies, from lentiviral vector production to cell processing. We also utilize a cryopreservation process that we believe will allow for the global distribution and, if approved, commercialization of our gene therapies. Key to our strategy is to continuously improve our technology and production processes and to leverage these improvements across our gene therapies. We continue our move towards implementing our commercial-scale plato platform, including heightened vector efficiency, our closed, automated manufacturing system and utilization of a TDM conditioning regimen. These platform improvements have been designed with the intent of improving safety and enhancing the potency and long-term durability of our therapies. We are developing the plato platform to form the backbone of our commercial programs, with the intent of replacing our original academic platform with improved solutions for delivering our gene therapy candidates to patients in multiple disease indications. We believe improvements from our plato platform may lead to better patient outcomes with our gene therapy candidates. 
 Our Expertise 
 We are led by biopharmaceutical experts with extensive experience in gene and cellular therapy, and rare diseases. Our team has broad expertise in the clinical, regulatory and commercialization aspects of rare diseases as well as process development and manufacturing for cellular therapies. Members of our management team have held senior positions at Shire, Genzyme, Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline, Lonza and other companies pursuing development, manufacturing and commercialization of gene and cellular therapies and therapies to treat rare diseases. 
Our Strategy 
 Our goal is to develop and commercialize potentially curative lentiviral-based gene therapies for patients and expand the use of this approach to treat a number of diseases potentially addressable by our ex vivo gene therapy candidates. Key elements of our strategy include: 
 

 | Rapidly Advance Our Initial Gene Therapies Targeting Lysosomal Storage Diseases. We are initially targeting lysosomal storage diseases and are developing a deep pipeline of four gene therapies to treat Fabry disease, Gaucher disease, cystinosis and Pompe disease. We intend to rapidly advance these gene therapies into clinical trials and obtain initial efficacy data in patients from these development

programs. AVR-RD-01 has been well tolerated and demonstrated significant increased enzyme activity to date in an ongoing investigator-sponsored Phase 1 clinical trial. We received approval from both the Australian and Canadian regulatory authorities to initiate our company-sponsored Phase 2 clinical trial for AVR-RD-01 and, on December 13, 2018, the second patient in this clinical trial was dosed at an Australian site. In 2018, we held a pre-IND meeting with the FDA to discuss the requirements to commence clinical trials in the United States, and we expect to open a U.S. site for our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of AVR-RD-01 in the second half of 2019. In addition, we also expect enrollment in Japan for AVR-RD-01 to begin in 2020 following receipt of regulatory clearance. We are also planning to conduct a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of AVR-RD-02, and we expect patients will be dosed in that clinical trial the second half of 2019. In addition, an academic investigator-sponsored Phase 1/2 clinical trial of AVR-RD-04 is being planned and we expect patients will be dosed in that clinical trial in the second half of 2019. In addition, we intend to pursue pathways for accelerated review and approval of our product candidates by the FDA and international regulatory authorities through programs such as the Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapies, or RMAT, program in the United States.

 | Implement our plato Platform with Refined Approach to Conditioning, Enhanced Vector Technology and Optimized Manufacturing Processes. We believe our innovations in viral vector design, cellular manufacturing, cryopreservation, and other related processes are important steps towards advancing the field of lentiviral-based gene therapy and realizing its full potential to treat a number of diseases. We are continuing our move towards implementing our commercial-scale plato platform, which we believe will serve as the foundation for our anticipated worldwide commercialization activities. Our current activities include moving our cell processing to an automated, closed system, transitioning to our proprietary four-plasmid-produced lentiviral vector, or LV2, and implementing a conditioning regimen that is administered using TDM. We have developed a manufacturing process that we believe is both reproducible and scalable and intend to leverage our core competencies to implement a closed, automated manufacturing system that will enable us to deliver our gene therapies to patients at an industrialized scale. In addition, with our planned changes to our conditioning regimen, we intend to use a single-agent myeloablative conditioning that is administered using TDM. We believe this will enable us to pursue early intervention for the treatment of lysosomal storage diseases and expand into a wide range of diseases where lentiviral-based gene therapy has not been previously utilized. We will continue to leverage advancements in stem cell transplantation in order to improve patient safety and tolerability of our lentiviral-based gene therapies.

 | Build Global Infrastructure to Reach Patients Across the World. Lysosomal storage diseases afflict patients globally and we intend to build global infrastructure in order to provide treatment to patients around the world. We currently intend to conduct clinical trials across multiple geographies, including the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, Europe and Israel. We have established a global network of suppliers and contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Leverage Our Approach Beyond Our Initial Indications. We are initially developing gene therapies for the treatment of four different lysosomal storage diseases and believe that we will gain significant learnings and technical insights from these programs. We intend to leverage our technology and insights to treat a number of rare and non-rare diseases where we believe our lentiviral approach has transformative potential.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Approach 
 We develop therapies utilizing our ex vivo lentiviral-based gene therapy approach to transform a patients own cells into a drug product. Our gene therapies employ lentiviral vectors that are designed to result in stable integration of the desired genes in the chromosomes of the stem cells such that they are permanently maintained in the cell and can be reproduced as the cell divides. We focus on delivering our lentiviral-based gene therapies to patient-derived hematopoietic stem cells, which are primitive stem cells that develop into all types of blood 
 
4 


  cells, including white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets. To accomplish this, we harvest a patients hematopoietic stem cells and modify them ex vivo to add a new, functional copy of the gene that is defective in the target disease. We then infuse the modified cells back into the patient. Our gene therapies are designed to be administered to the patient as a one-time therapy following a TDM conditioning regimen. 
 We are initially focused on employing our approach to treat and potentially cure lysosomal storage diseases. These diseases have well-understood biologies, identified patient populations, established standards of care yet with significant unmet medical needs, and represent large markets with approximately $4.0 billion in worldwide net sales in 2017. We are industrializing our ex vivo lentiviral-based gene therapy approach into a robust, scalable and, if approved, commercially viable process that will allow us to deliver our potentially curative therapies to patients across different geographies with these and other serious monogenic disorders. 
 Advantages of Our Lentiviral-Based Gene Therapy Approach 
 We believe lentiviral-based gene therapy provides numerous advantages, including: 
 

 | Durable Benefit. Lentiviral vectors have the potential to provide life-long benefits with a single dose. Lentiviral vectors can integrate stably into the genome of hematopoietic stem cells and, when these cells replicate, they pass the integrated genes on to their progeny cells.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Systemic Therapeutic Effect. Progeny cells circulate systemically and may migrate into tissues and therefore have the ability to provide therapeutic benefit to affected tissues and organs throughout the body. In addition, we believe that the conditioning regimen designed to be used as part of our plato platform may have the potential to allow our gene therapies to cross the blood-brain barrier, a feature which may yield therapeutic benefit in diseases that have a central nervous system component.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Function cell correction. Lentiviral-based gene therapy has the potential to restore functional proteins in CD34 stem cell daughter cells such as macrophages.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | History of Safety. Over the past 10 years, no instances of insertional mutagenesis or leukemogenesis from lentiviral vectors have been observed in clinical trials in which over 200 total patients have been treated.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Broad Patient Applicability. Lentiviral-based gene therapies have been used to deliver treatments to patients of all ages, including children, and to patients who may be ineligible for other types of gene therapy due to the presence of preexisting antibodies that detect viral vectors and trigger the immune system to destroy the vector and cells infected by the vector.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Larger and Varied Payloads. In contrast to other viral vectors, lentiviruses have the capacity to carry larger gene sequences, which allow them to potentially address a large variety of indications.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Strategic Selection of Our Initial Indications 
 There are approximately 50 identified lysosomal storage diseases, which are characterized by an abnormal toxic build-up of by-products in the bodys cells. We are initially targeting Fabry disease, Gaucher disease, cystinosis and Pompe disease. Each of these diseases affects a meaningful number of patients, has a suboptimal standard of care with unmet medical need and, we believe, is appropriate for lentiviral-based gene therapy. We believe our approach addresses the shortcomings of existing therapies where patients disease continues to progress despite chronic dosing and that our approach has the potential to halt progression of these diseases. 
 Clinical proof of concept already exists for allogeneic bone marrow transplant in some lysosomal storage diseases, supporting the notion that transplantation of cells that produce normal enzyme can have clinical impact on disease. Experience with allogeneic bone marrow transplant in patients with Gaucher disease provides evidence to support our ex vivo gene therapy approach. Additionally, in cystinosis, transplant of human bone marrow and hematopoietic stem cells into a mouse model demonstrates proof of concept efficacy for transplant. Our ex vivo gene therapy approach allows patients to be their own cell donor, eliminating the need to find a 
 
5 


  matched bone marrow donor, while reducing the risk of complications related to the immunosuppression regimens required in allogeneic cell transplant in order to prevent both rejection and graft versus host disease, 
 Expanding the Utility of Lentiviral-Based Gene Therapy with TDM-Enabled Conditioning Regimen 
 A core part of our approach is to expand the use of lentiviral-based gene therapy to treat numerous diseases. We believe that we will be able to demonstrate durable effects in our targeted diseases utilizing a single myeloablative agent, busulfan, which we are transitioning to as part of implementing our plato platform. Busulfan is mildly immunosuppressive and is designed to be personalized to each patient using TDM to achieve the desired level of conditioning to allow for gene therapy administration while limiting complications. We believe our approach to conditioning has the potential for reduced short- and long-term toxicities and effective long-term engraftment. If realized, we believe these benefits may promote lentiviral-based gene therapy as a therapeutic option for less acutely severe diseases or diseases with approved therapies in which large unmet medical needs remain. 
 Prior to the reintroduction of ex vivo modified stem cells, a conditioning regimen is generally required to remove existing stem cells from the bone marrow in order to create space for the modified stem cells. Creating sufficient space in the bone marrow for the lentivirally-modified hematopoietic stem cells is required to enable the cells to engraft long-term and produce their progeny cells. Ablation requires the use of cytotoxic drugs that can transiently compromise the patients immune system, known as neutropenia, and ability to form blood clots, known as thrombocytopenia. 
 Since its first clinical use in 2003, lentiviral-based gene therapy has been observed to be well-tolerated in third parties clinical trials for rare diseases such as beta thalassemia, ALD, MLD and ADA-SCID. The use of ex vivo lentiviral-based gene therapies was initially restricted primarily to the most acutely severe diseases where the risks of the typical requirement for ablating the patients bone marrow, which significantly impairs those patients immune systems, had a clinically justifiable risk/benefit profile due to the novelty of the approach and the severity of the diseases. To date, over 200 patients have been treated with lentiviral-based gene therapies in third parties and our rare disease clinical trials, and we believe the technology can be developed for other serious conditions based on a rigorous risk/benefit assessment. The ablation procedure, also known as the conditioning regimen, is an inherent part of the ex vivo gene therapy treatment procedure, and is administered prior to the gene therapy. The more intensive the conditioning regimen, the greater the risk of toxicity. However, we believe the risk of toxicity can be managed through utilization of therapeutic drug monitoring, or TDM. We are refining our approach to conditioning to use a single-agent, myeloablative conditioning regimen administered in conjunction with TDM, which is designed to permit patients to receive appropriate levels of conditioning to promote long-term engraftment while seeking to lessen toxicity. Such an approach could potentially allow the conditioning regimen to be performed during a limited hospital stay or potentially through an outpatient procedure, on a case-by-case basis as may be directed by the patients physician. We believe our approach of choosing diseases where a single myeloablative conditioning agent, coupled with TDM, can manage patient tolerability, which has the potential to extend the reach of our gene therapies to a broad range of diseases as first-line therapies. Our goal is to broaden the applicability of lentiviral-based gene therapy by initially targeting diseases with tractable gene mutations, well-understood biology and that benefit from the sustained systemic delivery of an active protein. 
 plato: Our Commercial-Scale Platform 
 Since forming our company, we have centered our efforts on developing first-line gene therapies, based on preceding academic approaches. While we believe these approaches have been adequate for our development programs to date, key to our strategy is to continuously improve our technology and production processes and to leverage these improvements across our gene therapies. We have designed plato to serve as our commercial-scale platform for our anticipated future worldwide commercialization activities, and our platform improvements already include differentiated features such as cryopreserved end-product and streamlined three-day manufacturing. We are continuing our transition towards implementing our plato platform, including moving our 
 
6 


  cell processing to an automated, closed system, transitioning to utilizing our proprietary four-plasmid-produced lentiviral vector, which we refer to as LV2, and a refined approach to conditioning utilizing busulfan that is administered with TDM. If successfully implemented, we believe our plato platform will represent a significant advance in our industry towards achieving the quality and scale required for global commercialization of gene therapies. Our plato platform is designed to feature: 
 

 | Large scale vector production: We expect to have manufacturing capabilities at 200-liter bioreactor scale in the second half of 2019, with vector production capable of treating a substantial number of patients per year.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Global reach: We intend to utilize an automated, closed system for manufacturing, which is designed to allow for the flexible production of our gene therapies. The automated, closed manufacturing system is portable with proprietary AVROBIO algorithms which allow for efficient establishment of manufacturing capabilities in multiple geographies that can be expanded or adjusted as our global supply requirements evolve. We believe this approach will facilitate global manufacturing and shipping of our gene therapies, and will promote access to our products by patients and caregivers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Quality of manufacturing: Our platform is designed to utilize current good manufacturing practices, or CGMP, and we believe our automated, closed manufacturing system may result in less production variability and reduce the risk of operator error, while enhancing the potency of the drug product. We believe these features will improve the quality of our gene therapies that are produced.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Patient convenience: Our gene therapies are cryopreserved, which is a feature designed to promote a longer shelf-life. We believe that a longer shelf-life will allow patients and clinics to schedule treatment sessions with greater convenience.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Cost containment: Our platform is designed to control fixed and variable expenses associated with manufacturing our gene therapies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In 2019, we plan to introduce three upgrades to our plato platform. These upgrades include moving our cell processing to an automated closed system, upgrading our lentiviral vector and implementing TDM using busulfan in our single-agent myeloablative conditioning regimen. 
 We believe the plato platform will form the backbone of our future commercialization efforts and our goal to take gene therapy mainstream. We intend to implement our planned upgrades from our plato platform in 2019 for clinical trials investigating AVR-RD-01 and AVR-RD-02. Specifically, we plan to transition to utilizing the plato platform for the majority of our company-sponsored Phase 2 clinical trial of AVR-RD-01 for the treatment of Fabry disease and at the initiation of our Phase 1/2 clinical trial of AVR-RD-02 for Gaucher disease. 
 Next Generation Vector Technology 
 We utilize our core expertise in the development and optimization of lentiviral vectors to continuously improve the vectors used in our gene therapies. We have made and expect to continue to make enhancements to our lentiviral vectors to improve efficacy, efficiency and safety. For example, clinical trials of AVR-RD-01 to date have utilized our original academic three-plasmid-produced lentiviral vector, which we refer to as LV1. In our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of AVR-RD-01 and for future planned trials of our product candidates, we intend to transition to utilizing our proprietary LV2. Our goal is to employ vectors that are state of the art and that can be produced in a cost-effective and scalable manner. 
Automated, Closed Manufacturing System 
 Our team has significant experience in cell processing and commercial-scale cellular therapy manufacturing. We have developed and are implementing a detailed plan for more cost efficient and scalable manufacturing of our gene therapies. In contrast to a number of other gene therapy companies that have not developed their commercial scale plans from the outset, we are currently executing on our plans to move to a closed suspension 
 
7 


  bioreactor system for vector production, as well as a closed, automated system for manufacturing our gene therapy product. Our move to a closed, automated manufacturing system is expected to be complete by the end of 2019 as part of implementing upgrades from our plato platform. If successfully implemented, we believe our plato platform will feature the first automated, closed manufacturing system in CD34+ gene therapy. 
 Our manufacturing approach is intended to allow for the production of drug product using relatively small, discrete devices that can be placed in a clean room, which may reduce our reliance on large traditional clean rooms that are expensive to establish. We believe our manufacturing approach may result in greater flexibility in the location of manufacture and help to control costs associated with traditional manufacturing. In addition, we believe our automated manufacturing process may reduce operator error and yield greater consistency and less variability in the manufactured drug product. 
 We currently have a CMO partner for the production of our cellular drug product in Australia and we have established two CMO partners in the United States who are currently preparing for production with CGMP-readiness in process for AVR-RD-01 and AVR-RD-02. We also are in the process of establishing a CMO partnership in Europe. 
 Below are data generated as part of our comparability studies supporting our transition to LV2 and our automated manufacturing process. These data are derived from full-scale development runs using starting material from normal donors, as well as from a limited number of patient production runs. The results support our belief in the enhanced potency of the drug product produced using LV2 and the automated process, and show the improved efficacy of our optimized LV2 over our original LV1, as measured by increases in both vector copy number, or VCN, and enzyme activity. VCN refers to the average number of copies of the lentiviral-vector inserted gene that are integrated into the genome of a cell. We believe that our transition from LV1 to LV2 and the automated manufacturing process has the potential to increase transduction efficiency and VCN in the drug product that is delivered to the patient.

Optimization of Conditioning Regimen 
 The conditioning regimen that we have historically employed utilizes melphalan, a common chemotherapy drug, to ablate the patients bone marrow. As part of the upgrades to our plato platform, we intend to transition to utilizing busulfan, another chemotherapy drug, that has been in use since the 1950s. Busulfan is indicated for use in combination with cyclophosphamide as a conditioning regimen prior to allogeneic stem cell transplantation for chronic myeloid leukemia. Busulfan is routinely used in conditioning regimens before allogeneic stem cell transplantations for both malignant and non-malignant conditions. It has also been used as a single-agent, or in combination with an immunosuppressive agent, such as cyclophosphamide, in conditioning regimens prior to ex vivo gene therapy transplants. 
 We believe that the transition to busulfan for our conditioning regimen may confer several advantages. For example, busulfan will permit utilization of TDM in our conditioning regimen, thereby enabling physicians to personalize the dosing to each patient by titrating over four days to enhance patient tolerability to the conditioning procedure and promote cell engraftment. By contrast, melphalan is administered once with no TDM, and may cause concern of conditioning-related toxicity across patients due to individual differences in metabolism of the drug. In addition, we believe that the utilization of busulfan in our single-agent myeloablative conditioning regimen may have the potential to allow our gene therapies to cross the blood-brain barrier, a feature which may yield therapeutic benefit in diseases that have a central nervous system component, such as Fabry disease, Gaucher disease, Pompe disease and other rare and non-rare diseases. Finally, our busulfan conditioning regimen is designed to create more space in the ablated bone marrow compared to melphalan and may increase the average VCN of the patient bone marrow following treatment with the drug product, which are features that we believe will promote better cell engraftment and durability of the gene therapy.

 We are aware that there have been cases of therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome, or t-MDS, a type of blood disorder that is a potential precursor to acute myeloid leukemia, in patients with pre-existing cancer where busulfan treatment was posited to be a contributing factor to this secondary malignancy. However, we have reviewed over 700 published cases of busulfan exposure preceding bone marrow transplant, hematopoietic cell transplant, or ex-vivo gene therapy for non-malignant indications, of which 648 were from peer-reviewed literature. Of the 648 busulfan exposures reported in peer-reviewed literature, none of the cases reported t-MDS. Of the 67 exposures reported in non-peer-reviewed published abstracts, 66 reported no cases of t-MDS resulting from busulfan exposure, and in one case it was reported that a patient developed t-MDS. In that case, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, busulfan treatment was posited to be a contributing factor. We believe that due to the presence of other confounding factors in the patient, the cause of that patients t-MDS has not been conclusively determined. We also intend to utilize molecular cytogenetic screening to further reduce such risks to patients. 
 While the busulfan conditioning regimen is more intensive than the original conditioning regimen that utilizes melphalan, we believe it is still milder than some of the more aggressive conditioning regimens associated with gene therapies for other diseases, such as when busulfan is used in combination with cyclophosphamide, used at a higher dose, or when TDM is not applied. Furthermore, we believe our conditioning regimen may produce the desired effect while potentially allowing for a limited hospital stay or potentially for an outpatient procedure, on a case-by-case basis as may be directed by the patients physician. 
 Advantages of Our Approach over Existing Therapies 
 We believe our gene therapy solutions offer several potential advantages over existing therapies for lysosomal storage diseases, including: 
 

 | Curative Impact That Can Halt or Reverse Disease Progression. Existing ERTs for Fabry, Gaucher and Pompe and oral therapies for cystinosis provide some therapeutic benefit to patients. However, because of their suboptimal pharmacokinetics, these ERTs only transiently increase plasma enzyme levels and the therapies for cystinosis require multiple doses throughout the day. In contrast, our lentiviral-based gene therapies are designed to enable the body to constantly produce the functional enzyme or other protein. This can potentially halt pathological damage and, depending on the targeted indication and organ system, may even reverse disease progression. Our lentiviral-based gene therapies may provide potentially curative treatment to patients. This concept is illustrated in the graphs below.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Durable, Single-Dose Treatment. Our gene therapies offer the potential for a single dose to replace life-long, bi-weekly infusions or daily oral therapies that are often accompanied by numerous side effects and impact patients quality of life. Our gene therapies are designed to transform the patients own
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


cells into a drug product that enables the continuous delivery of functional enzyme or other protein throughout the body after a single dose.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
10 


 
 | Reduced Treatment Cost Over a Patients Lifetime. Existing ERTs and oral therapies can cost millions of dollars over a patients lifetime because these therapies require frequent doses of expensive treatments to manage symptoms. Our single-dose gene therapies are designed to replace the costly chronic intravenous and oral therapies that are the current standard of care for patients with lysosomal storage diseases.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Pipeline 
 Our initial gene therapies are AVR-RD-01 for the treatment of Fabry disease, AVR-RD-02 for the treatment of Gaucher disease, AVR-RD-04 for the treatment of cystinosis and AVR-RD-03 for the treatment of Pompe disease. AVR-RD-01 is currently being evaluated in an investigator-sponsored Phase 1 clinical trial and a company-sponsored Phase 2 clinical trial, which we initiated on June 7, 2018. In addition, Phase 1/2 clinical trials for both AVR-RD-02 and AVR-RD-04 are being planned and we expect patients will be dosed in the second half of 2019. The status of our initial lentiviral-based gene therapy programs is reflected below. 
AVR-RD-01, Our Gene Therapy for Fabry Disease 
 We are developing AVR-RD-01 for the treatment of Fabry disease. We manufacture AVR-RD-01 from stem cells that are first harvested from the patient, modified to add the gene that encodes for AGA, and then infused into the patient. AVR-RD-01 is currently being evaluated in an investigator-sponsored Phase 1 clinical trial and a company-sponsored Phase 2 clinical trial. To date, AVR-RD-01 has demonstrated significant increased enzyme activity in the first four patients treated in the investigator-sponsored Phase 1 clinical trial and the first patient in our company-sponsored Phase 2 clinical trial, for whom we have provided interim data. The fifth patient in the investigator-sponsored Phase 1 clinical trial of AVR-RD-01 was dosed on February 21, 2019, completing enrollment in this investigator-sponsored clinical trial. On December 13, 2018, the second patient was dosed in our company-sponsored Phase 2 clinical trial of AVR-RD-01.Disease Overview 
 Fabry disease is a rare lysosomal storage disease associated with significant morbidity and early mortality. It is caused by a gene defect that causes a deficiency of AGA, which breaks down a particular type of fat in the bodys cells known as globotriaosylceramide, or Gb3. As Gb3 and other related substrates increase in patients with Fabry disease, these become toxic to the patients cells. Gb3 and other glycosphingolipids accumulate and result in damage to the kidneys, heart and brain. Accumulation of Gb3 in tissues such as the heart and the vascular system can lead to life threatening vascular blockages and thus stroke and heart attacks. In addition, high levels of Gb3 substrate accumulation in the kidney can cause kidney failure. Gb3 can also accumulate in other tissues, such as the nervous system where it leads to debilitating pain. Due to end-stage renal disease and other life-threatening complications associated with Fabry disease, the average life expectancy in affected males is approximately 58 years of age. 
 Most patients with Fabry disease begin experiencing chronic pain in childhood but are often not diagnosed with Fabry disease until their twenties, due to a broad variation in patient symptoms. Over 1,000 gene mutations 
 
11 


  associated with Fabry disease have been identified. It is estimated that Fabry disease is diagnosed in approximately one in 40,000 males and one in 118,000 females in the United States, but studies have suggested that a larger number of patients may be undiagnosed. 
 Fabry disease is an X-linked disorder, meaning the gene that is responsible is located on the X chromosome. Because males have only one X chromosome, an abnormal copy of the gene that causes Fabry disease is sufficient to cause the disease. However, unlike other X-linked disorders, where female carriers of an abnormal gene are usually unaffected, Fabry disease also often causes significant morbidity in females who inherit one abnormal copy and one normal copy of the gene associated with the disease. 
 Limitations of Current Therapies 
 Fabry disease is primarily treated with periodic infusions of ERT consisting of AGA enzyme over the patients lifetime. The most commonly prescribed ERTs for Fabry disease are Fabrazyme, marketed by Sanofi Genzyme, and Replagal, marketed by Shire, which was acquired by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd. In 2018, Fabrazyme and Replagal generated worldwide net sales of over $855 million and $490 million, respectively. The annual average cost to the healthcare system per patient prescribed Fabrazyme in the United States is approximately $320,000. In addition, because ERTs are not curative and only slow, but do not halt, the progression of disease, patients deteriorate and the healthcare system incurs significant costs associated with recurring medical interventions. 
 Although ERT provides therapeutic benefit and can reduce Gb3 substrate levels and extend a patients life expectancy, ERT requires chronic infusions throughout the patients life. Patients prescribed ERT generally receive an infusion every other week. However, because of their suboptimal pharmacokinetics, ERTs only temporarily increase plasma enzyme levels. As a result, patients with Fabry disease prescribed ERT continue to have disease progression, including ongoing decline in renal function, potentially including renal failure, cardiovascular disease and ongoing debilitating pain including periods of severe pain crisis. Physicians report that patients have recurrence of symptoms as the therapeutic effect of ERT wanes between bi-weekly treatments. 
 Alternatives to ERT for patients with Fabry disease are limited. Galafold (migalastat), an oral therapy marketed by Amicus, was approved by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in May 2016, and by the FDA in August 2018. Amicus reports that only 35% to 50% of the gene mutations associated with Fabry disease are amenable to migalastat. 
 Our Solution 
 We are developing AVR-RD-01 to halt disease progression and potentially cure patients with Fabry disease with a single dose of the patients own hematopoietic stem cells modified in an ex vivo procedure. AVR-RD-01 is a lentiviral-based gene therapy that contains a codon-optimized human gene and is designed to maximize the likelihood of sustained AGA production by hematopoietic stem cells and their progeny. 
 We believe that AVR-RD-01 offers a promising treatment for Fabry disease for the following reasons: 
 

 | One-Time Delivery. Lentiviral-based gene therapy provides the potential to transform a patients own cells into a drug product that enables the continuous delivery of active enzyme throughout the body after a single dose.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Proven Biology. Years of observations of patients prescribed ERT indicate that even partial plasma AGA activity is associated with improved outcomes. Increased AGA enzyme activity is able to reduce Gb3 levels in multiple cells and tissues supporting the ability of AGA in the plasma to enter lysosomes and degrade Gb3 in a process referred to as cross correction.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Wide Therapeutic Window. We believe that even partial enzyme activity, if continuous, has the potential to provide long-term therapeutic benefit. A wide range of levels of plasma AGA activity has
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
12 


 
been demonstrated to be both safe and effective in preclinical studies, reducing the need for precise regulation of enzyme expression levels and reinforcing that overexpression of AGA is not associated with increased safety risks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Mutation Independent. AVR-RD-01 is designed to increase plasma AGA levels in a patients cells, regardless of which of the more than 1,000 specific mutations underlie the patients disease.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ongoing Multicenter Investigator-Sponsored Clinical Trial 
 In an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of AVR-RD-01 being conducted by the University Health Network, or UHN, and sponsored by Fabry Disease Clinical Research and Therapeutics, or FACTs, at three centers in Canada, a total of five patients with Fabry disease who have been treated with ERT for at least six months have been enrolled, and enrollment is complete. In this clinical trial, ERT for these patients is suspended one month prior to receiving AVR-RD-01 and ERT is then resumed one month after the AVR-RD-01 treatment and continued at bi-weekly intervals. The protocol has been amended to allow the investigator team, at their discretion, to discontinue ERT six months after treatment with AVR-RD-01. The fifth patient is the last to be enrolled and was dosed February 21, 2019. 
 The primary goal for this clinical trial is to assess the safety and toxicity of AVR-RD-01 as measured by the frequency or severity of clinically notable abnormal vital signs and laboratory values and the frequency or severity of treatment-related adverse events. The safety of our initial, academic-based conditioning regimen is also being assessed in this clinical trial. 
 A secondary objective for this clinical trial is to obtain preliminary efficacy signals of AVR-RD-01 therapy as assessed by AGA enzyme activity. Plasma AGA enzyme activity derived from administration of ERT decreases rapidly after administration with no residual plasma activity remaining approximately one day after treatment. To evaluate the ability of AVR-RD-01 to increase enzyme activity, the level of AGA activity was assessed in a patient immediately prior to the administration of the patients next dose of ERT, when limited or no plasma AGA activity from previously-administered ERT dose would be expected. 
 All five patients in this clinical trial have been dosed. To date, the treatment was generally well-tolerated. In addition, in the first four patients for whom we have provided interim data, all of whom are males with classical Fabry disease, the level of plasma AGA enzyme activity began to rise after infusion. Plasma AGA enzyme activity was observed to increase from nearly undetectable levels before treatment to a peak within six months after treatment, followed by a decline and trending to stablilize to levels above the range for males with classical Fabry disease, defined as less than 1 nmol/hr/ml. We believe that the steep initial increase reflects AGA enzyme activity from the early progeny of the transduced stem cells, while the subsequent decline and stabilization in AGA enzyme levels reflect a shift from short term progenitor cells towards the gradual secretion of AGA enzyme by long-term engraftment cells that become more predominant over time. 
 As of 22 months after receiving AVR-RD-01, the first patients plasma AGA enzyme activity levels continued to be above the range for males with classical Fabry disease. Based on the level of endogenously produced enzyme activity, at the 18-month follow-up visit for this patient, the investigator team for the trial made a clinical decision to discontinue the bi-weekly ERT and the patient remains off ERT as of 22 months post-treatment with AVR-RD-01. Additionally, the third patient in this clinical trial voluntarily elected not to resume his regular bi-weekly treatment with ERT, and the patient remains off ERT as of six months post-treatment with AVR-RD-01. The second and fourth patients continue to receive concurrent ERT in accordance with the clinical trial protocol. Plasma AGA enzyme activity levels in the first, second, third and fourth patients remained above the range for males with classical Fabry disease, defined as less than 1 nmol/hr/ml, as of twenty-two months, twelve months, six months and twenty-two days after treatment, respectively. We believe these preliminary results, particularly from the first two patients in the trial with longer-term AGA data points reported, support the potential of AVR-RD-01 to drive functional enzyme production for long durations.

 As of twenty-two days after receiving AVR-RD-01, the level of AGA enzyme activity for the fourth patient was 10.9 nmol/hr/ml. 
 The below graph illustrates the levels of plasma AGA activity following AVR-RD-01 treatment in the four patients over various points in time.

--+-------------------------------

 All four patients are classical Fabry patients who were on ERT prior to the trial and who entered the FACTs trial with negligible endogenous AGA activity. Following treatment with AVR-RD-01, patients were observed to sustain endogenous enzyme activity levels above the threshold for classical Fabry disease. 
 The substrate, Gb3, and its toxic metabolite, known as lyso-Gb3 are considered surrogate markers for disease activity and treatment response for Fabry disease. In the case of ERT-naïve patients and patients who have discontinued ERT, we believe that reductions in Gb3 levels following treatment with gene therapy are likely driven by the therapeutic effect of gene therapy. The first patient in the investigator-sponsored Phase 1 clinical trial, who suspended ERT for one month following treatment with AVR-RD-01, discontinued ERT after 18 months post-treatment and currently remains off ERT. This patient had a plasma lyso-Gb3 value of 31 nmol/hr/ml on the day of treatment with AVR-RD-01 and this value was observed to rapidly decline following treatment and resumption of ERT, to 20 nmol/hr/ml and 13 nmol/hr/ml at one and three months, respectively. Even after discontinuation of ERT, the reduction in plasma lyso-Gb3 values was sustained, and remains below levels observed prior to treatment with AVR-RD-01. The third patient in this trial discontinued ERT one month prior to treatment with AVR-RD-01 and voluntarily elected not to resume ERT. This patient had a plasma lyso-Gb3 value of 52 nmol/hr/ml on the day of treatment with AVR-RD-01, and this value was observed to decrease to 33 nmol/hr/ml at three months.

 Preliminary results from this clinical trial also indicate the presence of lentiviral-vector inserted sequences in the blood and bone marrow of the first patient, which is a signal for successful transduction of the cells. An analysis of the bone marrow from the first patient in this clinical trial measured at 14 months following treatment with AVR-RD-01 suggests engraftment through this period. 
 Safety 
 Preliminary safety data indicate AVR-RD-01 was generally well-tolerated with no serious adverse events, or SAEs, related to study drug. Adverse events, or AEs, were consistent with expectations for the melphalan conditioning regimen prescribed by the study protocol. As of November 26, 2018, there were 79 AEs reported, 67 of which were assessed by the investigator as being possibly, probably or definitely related to protocol treatment or procedures (which includes apheresis, stem cell transplant procedure, blood draws, insertion of central catheters, drugs used for mobilization of stem cells and/or conditioning, and the drug product). No new AEs have been reported for the first patient since January 17, 2018 (12 months post-transplant), for the second patient since May 9, 2018 (seven months post-transplant), and the third patient since August 6, 2018 (four weeks post-transplant). 
 
15 


 Only one event, the development of a left thigh mass, was originally reported as an SAE but has now been considered by the study investigator as not serious and has resolved in the patient. In addition, investigators observed a temporary suppression of neutrophils counts and thrombocytopenia in two patients which is expected as consequence of the conditioning regimen. These decreases were transient and not associated with any negative long-term impact on the patients. Neutrophil and platelet counts recovered after dosing. Because this clinical trial is ongoing, safety data are preliminary and subject to change. Subsequent to November 26, 2018, we have not been notified by the investigators in this clinical trial of any suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions related to the study drug. 
 Phase 2 Multinational Clinical Trial 
 We are sponsoring an open label, multinational Phase 2 clinical trial of AVR-RD-01. This study was initiated in June 2018 in Australia and enrollment in this Phase 2 clinical trial is ongoing. Eight to 12 treatment-naïve males, 16 years and older, with classical Fabry disease are expected to be enrolled in this trial. Our objectives for this trial are to assess safety and efficacy as measured by multiple indicators, such as AGA enzyme activity, lyso-Gb3 and Gb3 levels in blood and various tissues, kidney and cardiac function, gastrointestinal symptoms, and pain and quality of life scores. All enrolled patients will receive a single treatment with AVR-RD-01 and will be followed for 48 weeks to measure safety and efficacy. We received approval from both the Australian and Canadian regulatory authorities to initiate our Phase 2 clinical trial for AVR-RD-01. We also plan to submit applications to allow commencement of clinical trials in the United States to the FDA and in Japan to the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, or PMDA, following meetings with each of these respective regulatory authorities. For the United States specifically, in 2018 we held a pre-IND meeting with the FDA to discuss the requirements to commence clinical trials in the United States, and we expect to open a U.S. site for our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of AVR-RD-01 in 2019. The second patient in our Phase 2 clinical trial was dosed at an Australian site on December 13, 2018 and the data safety monitoring committee has approved the consenting of the third patient in this trial. 
 By the first month after treatment with AVR-RD-01, AGA enzyme activity was observed to increase in the first patient to levels well above the level associated with classical Fabry disease in males. These enzyme levels were sustained at three months and six months after treatment. As of six months after receiving AVR-RD-01, the level of AGA enzyme activity for the first patient was 2.9 nmol/hr/ml. In addition, during the first three months after treatment, we observed a rapid decline in lyso-Gb3 levels, which stabilized at significantly lower levels compared to those prior to treatment. Within six months of treatment with AVR-RD-01, skin biopsy assessment revealed that the first patient also achieved a substantial reduction in substrate inclusions in capillary endothelium of the skin. The skin biopsies were evaluated using a standard scoring system for Gb3 accumulation and clearance. The scoring system has a range of zero to 3, with a score of zero representing none or trace accumulation, and a score of 3 representing severe accumulation. This patient scored a 3 at baseline and scored a 2 at six months after treatment with AVR-RD-01, as assessed by two independent blinded readers. The first patient in this clinical trial, who never received ERT, had a plasma lyso-Gb3 level of 31 nmol/hr/ml at six months after treatment with AVR-RD-01, compared to 202 nmol/hr/ml prior to administration with AVR-RD-01. The observed increase and stabilization in AGA enzyme activity was observed to correlate with the observed reduction in plasma lyso-Gb3 levels.

 For the first patient, the VCN measurement for the drug product was 0.7, and average VCN measurements at one month, two months, three months and six months post-treatment were 0.2, 0.2, 0.5 and 0.2, respectively. 
 Preliminary safety data from the ongoing Phase 2 study indicates that AVR-RD-01 was generally well-tolerated in both patients enrolled in the study. 
 As of January 1, 2019, there were 39 AEs reported, one of which was deemed by the investigator to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to drug product. AEs in this study can be assigned to more than one causality assessment. 
 As of January 1, 2019, five AEs were related to study procedures, 19 were related to the medication used in the conditioning regimen, seven were related to an underlying disease, and 10 were related to other causes. 
 As of January 1, 2019, four SAEs were reported, one pre-treatment and three post-treatment. No events were related to AVR-RD-01, and two events were related to the conditioning regimen. Because this clinical trial is ongoing, safety data are preliminary and subject to change. 
 After beginning stem cell mobilization but prior to undergoing the conditioning regimen and treatment with AVR-RD-01, the first patient experienced a seizure, which is categorized as an SAE but unrelated to the study drug, conditioning regimen or stem cell mobilization. This event has resolved in the patient. In addition, during a scheduled protocol visit seven days after dosing, the same patient reported nausea and vomiting and was admitted to hospital for fluid hydration. Because the nausea and vomiting warranted hospital admission, the event was categorized as an SAE, possibly related to the conditioning regimen; nausea and vomiting have resolved in the patient. A transient suppression of neutrophils and platelets, which is an anticipated consequence of the conditioning regimen, was also observed in the patient. The treating physician decided to monitor the patient in hospital until the patients neutrophil count increased. Neutrophil and platelet counts recovered after dosing. On June 20, 2018, the patient was discharged from the hospital six days after admission and 13 days after transplant. Nausea, vomiting and dehydration resolved as of June 15, 2018. In the opinion of the investigator, the event was unrelated to the study drug or stem cell mobilization, but was deemed probably related to the conditioning regimen. 
 The second patient experienced a post-treatment SAE of drug induced dermatosis seven days post-dosing. The rash was described as small, raised red bumps and were not painful. The patient was treated with hydrocortisone cream, and the rash appeared to be resolving after a single application and is continuing to resolve as of January 1, 2019. The patient was discharged from the hospital in less than 24 hours. In the opinion of the investigator, the relationship of the SAE to the procedure was not applicable and the relationship to stem cell mobilization, conditioning regimen and AVR-RD-01 was unknown. 
 
17 


 An additional SAE of culture negative sepsis was reported in the second patient nine days after treatment on December 22, 2018. The patient was admitted to the hospital with a mild sore throat. His urine cultures were negative and his blood cultures were negative for both aerobic and anaerobic organisms. The patient was discharged from the hospital on the fourteenth day after transplant. In the opinion of the investigator, the relationship of the SAE to the conditioning regimen was definite and the relationship to stem cell mobilization and AVR-RD-01 was unrelated. 
 During our Phase 2 clinical trial, we plan to transition the lentiviral vector from LV1 to our optimized proprietary LV2 from our plato platform, which we believe will further improve the efficacy and further enhance the safety of our lentiviral-based gene therapy. Because this proposed transition only impacts the ex vivo cell transduction process, and not the actual AGA enzyme that is produced by the transduced cells, or drug product, we believe this transition will be supported with in vitro comparability studies. 
 Preclinical Data 
 AVR-RD-01 has been evaluated in multiple mouse models. Key observations from these preclinical studies serve as the foundation for our lentiviral-based gene therapy approach: 
 

 | AGA cross correction occurs by which AGA in plasma was taken up into cells confirming that efficacy of AGA is not limited only to the cells that receive the gene therapy.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Lentiviral-based gene therapy targeting stem cells in mouse models of Fabry disease led to an elevated and sustained level of AGA enzyme activity in plasma.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Increased Enzyme Activity in Fabry Mouse Model After Receiving a Murine Equivalent of our 
 Drug Product, mAVR-RD-01



In a direct test of the ability of AVR-RD-01 to correct deficiencies in plasma AGA enzyme activity, a mouse model was created using a mouse strain in which the gene for AGA was inactivated. Human stem cells were harvested from patients with Fabry disease and the gene for AGA was added using the same lentiviral vector that was used to produce AVR-RD-01. This vector was then introduced to the mice. Twelve weeks following administration, the levels of Gb3 in both the spleen and liver were reduced to a statistically significant extent compared to mice that received unmodified cells from patients with Fabry disease. The FDA utilizes reported statistical measures when evaluating the results of a clinical trial, including statistical significance as measured by p-value as an evidentiary standard of efficacy, to evaluate the reported evidence of a product candidates safety and efficacy. If not otherwise specified, we used a conventional 5% or lower p-value

18 


  (p < 0.05) to define statistical significance for the data presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Levels in other tissues such as the heart and kidney also showed downward trends in Gb3. This study demonstrated that: 
 

 | Our lentiviral vector could efficiently transform human stem cells into a gene therapy.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Vector transduced human CD34 stem cells could engraft and replicate to produce progeny cells containing the AGA gene.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The AGA gene was expressed and functionally active post-treatment.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Cross correction of AGA produced by cells containing the functional AGA gene caused reductions in Gb3 in various tissues in the mouse model.

In addition, in a peer reviewed publication, overexpression of functional AGA with levels as high as 3,000 times the normal range in the mouse model over an 18 month period was not linked to toxicity or adverse effects as determined by long-term animal studies, implying a wide therapeutic window. 
 AVR-RD-02, Our Gene Therapy for Gaucher Disease 
 We are developing AVR-RD-02 for the treatment of Type 1 Gaucher disease. We will manufacture AVR-RD-02 from hematopoietic stem cells that are first harvested from the patient, modified to add the gene that encodes for glucocerebrosidase, or GCase, and then infused into the patient. We plan to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for AVR-RD-02 in patients with Type 1 Gaucher disease and expect to dose the first patient in this clinical trial in the second half of 2019. In September 2018, we received no objections from Health Canada in connection with our Clinical Trial Application, or CTA, in Canada for this planned Phase 1/2 clinical trial. We have subsequently received no objections letters to two CTA amendments that update our manufacturing process and clinical protocol to be consistent with our plato platform. We are currently working with potential investigative sites in Canada, and have submitted this trial for institutional review board, or IRB, approval. 
Disease Overview 
 Gaucher disease is a rare, autosomal recessive, lysosomal storage disease caused by a hereditary deficiency of functional GCase, an enzyme responsible for degrading glucocerebroside, a cell membrane building block, into glucose and lipids within lysosomes of cells. In patients with Gaucher disease, the recycling of 
 
19 


  glucocerebroside from the breakdown of old red and white blood cells is inhibited, leading to its accumulation in macrophages. These abnormal macrophages, known as Gaucher cells, accumulate in multiple organs, particularly the liver, spleen and bone marrow. 
 Gaucher disease is one of the most common lysosomal storage diseases. It is diagnosed in approximately one in 44,000 births worldwide and is more prevalent in certain ethnic groups, such as people of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage. Approximately 90% of patients suffering from Gaucher disease in western countries have Type 1 Gaucher disease, which manifests as multiple morbidities including enlargement of the spleen and liver, low red blood cells, or anemia, low platelet count, or thrombocytopenia, and bone abnormalities including bone pain, fractures and arthritis. Bruising, risk of bleeding and fatigue are common due to the thrombocytopenia and anemia. Compared with the general population, patients with Type 1 Gaucher disease have an approximately 20-fold increased risk of developing Parkinsons disease. Type 1 Gaucher disease does not have manifestations of central nervous system symptoms. 
 Limitations of Current Therapies 
 Type 1 Gaucher disease is currently treated with bi-weekly infusions of ERT consisting of recombinant GCase over a patients lifetime. The most commonly prescribed ERTs for Gaucher disease are Cerezyme, marketed by Sanofi Genzyme, and VPRIV, marketed by Shire. 
 Although long-term ERT for Gaucher disease results in some therapeutic benefit, ERTs leave patients with significant unmet needs. Twenty-five percent of patients with Gaucher disease continue to experience physical limitations following two years of ERT, and a clinically significant percentage of patients continue to experience bone pain, thrombocytopenia and enlargement of spleen following ten years of ERT. In a published study of ERT therapy for Gaucher disease, six target goals were evaluated, including parameters for hemoglobin and platelet levels, spleen and liver volumes, and general bone pain and severe disabling bone pain known as bone crisis. Following at least four years of ERT in this study, approximately 60% of patients failed to achieve one or more of these six target goals. 
 In addition to ERTs, the FDA has approved several oral therapies for the treatment of Gaucher disease, including Zavesca (miglustat) marketed by Actelion and Cerdelga (eliglustat) marketed by Sanofi Genzyme. We believe these oral therapies also provide suboptimal treatment. Zavesca is approved as a second line therapy and is associated with significant toxicities, including diarrhea, weight loss and tremors. Cerdelga is not approved for use in children, has highly variable metabolism due to patient-to-patient genetic variations and is highly susceptible to interactions with other drugs. 
 Both ERTs and oral therapies for Gaucher impose significant costs on the healthcare system. In the United States, the annual average cost to the healthcare system per patient prescribed Cerezyme or VPRIV is between approximately $325,000 and $400,000. The annual average cost to the healthcare system per patient prescribed Cerdelga is approximately $250,000. In 2018, Sanofi Genzymes Cerezyme and Cerdelga together generated worldwide net sales of over $1.0 billion and Shires VPRIV generated worldwide net sales of approximately $362 million. 
 Our Solution 
 We are developing AVR-RD-02 to potentially cure patients with Type 1 Gaucher disease with a single dose of the patients own hematopoietic stem cells modified in an ex vivo procedure. AVR-RD-02 is a lentiviral-based gene therapy that contains a codon-optimized human gene and is designed to maximize the likelihood of sustained GCase production in hematopoietic stem cells and their progeny. 
Upcoming Clinical Trial 
 We plan to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of AVR-RD-02 in patients with Type 1 Gaucher disease and to begin dosing patients in this clinical trial in 2019. In September 2018, we received a no objections letter for the 
 
20 


  CTA in Canada for this planned Phase 1/2 clinical trial. Our initial clinical trial will be an adaptive trial that will include both treatment-naïve patients and patients that are currently stable on ERT. We intend to enroll 8 to 16 patients, between the ages of 16 and 35, with Type 1 Gaucher disease. Patients currently prescribed ERT will cease treatment throughout the clinical trial. All enrolled patients will receive a single treatment with AVR-RD-02 and will be followed for 52 weeks to measure safety and efficacy. Our efficacy endpoints for this clinical trial will include measures of clinical efficacy, such as liver and spleen volumes, hemoglobin, platelet counts, bone pain and bone density measures along with other blood markers used in Gaucher disease. 
 Preclinical Data 
 AVR-RD-02 is based on extensive preclinical work from our collaborators at Lund University and leverages findings published in 2015 in Molecular Therapy which concluded that, in a Gaucher disease mouse model, a lentiviral-based gene therapy containing the gene for GCase could prevent the development and reverse clinically relevant signs of the disease. 
 In preclinical studies, a mouse model of Type I Gaucher disease exhibited increased glucocerebroside levels in the clinically-relevant tissues, the bone marrow, spleen and liver, and mimicked many of the same symptoms seen in patients such as an enlarged spleen. These preclinical studies assessed glucocerebroside levels, Gaucher cell infiltration, and spleen volume in the mouse model over 20 weeks following treatment with mAVR-RD-02.4 When mice with established disease were treated with AVR-RD-02, glucocerebroside levels decreased and symptoms such as an enlarged spleen were reversed within 20 weeks. Over this period, increased enzyme levels were observed in the bone marrow, spleen and liver in the mouse model. In addition, the mice that were treated with mAVR-RD-02 prior to manifesting symptoms did not develop symptoms of the disease. These data support the potential efficacy of AVR-RD-02 to prevent, as well as reverse, symptoms in patients with Gaucher disease.

This marker gene was removed as it is not required in the clinic, and the transgene encoding functional glucocerebrosidase was inserted into the LV2 backbone.

 Spleen Volume in a Mouse Model of Gaucher Disease 
 


AVR-RD-04, Our Gene Therapy for Cystinosis 
 Together with University of California, San Diego, or UCSD, we are developing CTNS-RD-04, which we refer to as AVR-RD-04, for the treatment of patients with cystinosis. AVR-RD-04 is manufactured from hematopoietic stem cells that are first harvested from the patient, modified to add the gene that encodes for cystinosin, and then infused into the patient. In December 2018, our collaborators at UCSD received clearance from the FDA for the IND application for CTNS-RD-04, and site opening activities have been initiated at UCSD. The academic investigator has submitted a grant application to secure funding for the planned academic sponsored Phase 1/2 clinical trial, and we expect the trial will open for enrollment in mid-2019 with the first patient anticipated to be dosed in the second half of 2019. 
 Disease Overview 
 Cystinosis is a rare, genetic, autosomal recessive, lysosomal storage disease caused by the accumulation of the amino acid cystine that is produced in the lysosomes of cells as the result of protein degradation. Cystine is normally transported through the lysosomal membrane to the cytosol where it is reutilized after its transformation to cysteine. In cystinosis, cystine accumulates inside the lysosomes because of a defect in the gene that encodes cystinosin, a protein that transports cystine across the lysosomal membrane. Cystine is poorly soluble and forms crystals as its concentration increases. These crystals build up and cause complications in many organs and tissues. The kidneys and eyes are especially vulnerable to damage, and the muscles, thyroid, pancreas and testes may also be affected. 
 The most severe form of cystinosis begins in infancy, causing poor growth and a particular type of kidney damage in which certain molecules, such as glucose, amino acids, phosphate, and bicarbonate, that should be reabsorbed into the bloodstream are instead eliminated in the urine. These renal problems ultimately lead to impaired growth and may result in soft, bowed bones, especially in the legs. By the time the patient is approximately two years old, cystine crystals may be present in the cornea, and the buildup of these crystals in the eye causes pain and an increased sensitivity to light. Untreated children with cystinosis may experience complete kidney failure by the age of ten. Other signs and symptoms that may occur in untreated patients, especially after adolescence, include muscle deterioration, blindness, inability to swallow, diabetes, thyroid and nervous system problems. More than 90% of untreated patients require a kidney transplant before the age of 20. It is estimated that cystinosis disease is diagnosed in approximately one in 170,000 people. 
 
22 


 Limitations of Current Therapies 
 Cystinosis is currently treated with two oral formulations of cysteamine that enter the lysosome and stimulate the breakdown of cystine into products that do not require the cystinosin protein to be transported. Oral treatment can delay the development of kidney failure by six to ten years if it is started at a very early age, however it cannot prevent kidney failure or the development of other complications, such as the formation of cystine crystals in the cornea. The approved oral therapies for cystinosis are Procysbi (delayed release cysteamine bitartrate), marketed by Horizon Orphan and Cystagon (cysteamine bitartrate) marketed by Mylan and Recordati S.p.A. In 2018, Procysbi generated worldwide net sales of $155 million. The annual average cost to the healthcare system per patient prescribed Procysbi in the United States is between approximately $625,000 and $750,000. 
 Procysbi and Cystagon must be taken orally every 12 or six hours, respectively, leading to significant pill burden and compliance challenges. Because cysteamine works by directly binding to cystine, rather than through a typical small molecule that inhibits an enzyme or receptor, a substantial quantity is required. For adults, this can mean taking at least 12 capsules twice a day, every day. Oral therapy with cysteamine is associated with a high degree of noncompliance due to the frequency with which it must be dosed and the accompanying nausea, as well as the acrid sulfur smell that it produces in the breath and body. It has been estimated that only one third of patients are able to adhere to the strict dosing schedule. Studies have shown that adherence diminishes over time in adolescents and adults despite disease impact. Further, oral cysteamine treatment has no effect on ocular cystine crystals deposits, thus requiring patients to be treated with topical cysteamine eye drops which must be applied each hour the patient is awake. 
 Our Solution 
 We are developing AVR-RD-04 to potentially cure patients with cystinosis with a single dose of the patients own hematopoietic stem cells modified in an ex vivo procedure. AVR-RD-04 is a lentiviral-based gene therapy containing a human gene for cystinosin designed to maximize the likelihood of sustained cystinosin production in hematopoietic stem cells and their progeny. 
Upcoming Clinical Trial 
 In a planned Phase 1/2 clinical trial of AVR-RD-04 that will be conducted by our collaborators at UCSD, six patients with cystinosis who are currently being treated with cysteamine will be enrolled. Cystine levels in tissues such as white blood cells and skin will be followed in these patients as well as cystine crystal counts in the eye. Clinical parameters such as kidney function, muscle strength, bone density, and endocrine function will also be followed with the intent of identifying appropriate parameters to inform future clinical development. Our collaborators received clearance of an IND in the U.S. in December 2018. The study drug utilized in this trial will not be manufactured using our plato platform, and neither the automated, closed manufacturing system nor LV2 will be used in connection with this investigator-sponsored clinical trial. 
Preclinical Data 
 In order to mimic the human disease, the mouse model for cystinosis has the gene for cystinosin disrupted, resulting in the inability of the cystinosin protein to transport cystine out of the lysosomes. This ultimately results in the accumulation of cystine in all tissues similar to that seen in patients with cystinosis. The ability of mouse stem cells modified with a lentiviral vector containing the gene for human cystinosin to treat cystinosis was then tested in the affected mice. 
 Introduction of mAVR-RD-04 into the diseased mice was observed to significantly lower cystine levels in tissues such as the liver, spleen and, in male mice, the kidney. These lower levels persisted until the end of the 
 
23 


  experiment at eight months. AVR-RD-04 treatment was also associated with potentially improved kidney function in male mice, thus addressing an essential clinical need in patients with cystinosis. 
 mAVR-RD-04 Leads to Lower Cystine Levels in Multiple Tissues in a Mouse Model of Cystinosis 
 


In a separate experiment in this cystinosis mouse model, lentiviral-marked hematopoietic stem cell transplant using normal mouse stem cells led to the reduction of cystine crystals in the cornea, a clinically significant tissue in patients with cystinsosis. In this cystinosis mouse model, affected mice develop eye disease similar to humans, including crystal deposits in the cornea, central corneal opacification, loss of corneal cellular architecture and eventually a scarred, shrunken eye with no function. Published results from this study demonstrate that abundant hematopoietic stem cell-derived macrophages migrated into the cornea and provided functional cystinosin-bearing lysosomes to the corneal cells. The images below reflect the elimination of cystine crystals in the cornea of the mice following engraftment of the modified allogeneic stem cells. As the level of allogeneic stem cell engraftment increased, greater elimination of the cystine crystals was observed. This indicates that stem cells can migrate to the cornea and cross-correct corneal cells. This result demonstrates that it is possible to correct for the defective cystinosin gene in the eye indirectly through expression of the gene in hematopoietic cells.

 AVR-RD-03, Our Gene Therapy for Pompe Disease 
 We are developing AVR-RD-03 for the treatment of Pompe disease. We will manufacture AVR-RD-03 from hematopoietic stem cells that are first harvested from the patient, modified to add the gene that encodes for acid alpha glucosidase A, or GAA, attached to a peptide sequence known as a glycosylation-independent lysosomal targeting, or GILT, tag and then infused into the patient. AVR-RD-03 will incorporate a GILT tag because the GILT tag has been found to increase the uptake of GAA into cells, especially in muscle cells by a multiple of 25, which is a particularly important target tissue for patients with Pompe disease and a target tissue that is considered difficult to access for ERT. AVR-RD-03 is designed to incorporate a proprietary potent promoter to increase volume of system enzyme in circulation. 
 Disease Overview 
 Pompe disease is a rare, autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease caused by a mutation in the gene that encodes for GAA that results in the buildup of glycogen, a complex sugar, in the bodys cells. The accumulation of glycogen in certain organs and tissues, especially muscles, impairs normal tissue and organ function. Patients with Pompe disease experience serious muscle related problems, including progressive muscle weakness, especially in the legs and trunk, and the muscles that control breathing. As the disorder progresses, breathing problems can lead to respiratory failure. 
 The overall diagnosed incidence of Pompe disease is estimated to be approximately one in 58,000 people although frequency and disease progression varies with age of onset, ethnicity and geography. Overall diagnosed incidence of Pompe disease is projected to increase to one in 22,000 people as it is increasingly included in newborn screening panels. 
 The severity of Pompe disease symptoms and rate of progression is highly variable and correlated with age of symptom onset and the degree of enzyme deficiency. Infantile or early onset disease, the most severe form of Pompe disease, accounts for approximately 25% of all affected patients. Those with early-onset disease are usually diagnosed in the first few months of life and is associated with cardiomyopathy. Left untreated, these patients can die due to heart failure, respiratory distress or malnutrition resulting from feeding difficulties within the first year of life. Patients with late-onset disease typically have higher enzyme levels and usually have symptoms such as reduced mobility and respiratory problems but are not at increased risk of developing cardiomyopathy. Late-onset patients experience progressive difficulty walking and respiratory decline. While life expectancy can vary, Pompe disease is a life-limiting disease that can result in death due to complications from respiratory failure. 
 Limitations of Current Therapies 
 Pompe disease is currently treated with ERT delivered by bi-weekly intravenous infusion. The only approved therapy for Pompe disease is Lumizyme (known as Myozyme outside of the United States), marketed by Sanofi Genzyme, which generated worldwide net sales of over $950 million in 2018. The annual average cost to the healthcare system per patient prescribed Lumizyme in the United States is approximately $500,000. 
 Though patients treated with ERT for Pompe disease have improved survival and respiratory function, ERT is not curative, and patients in long-term observational studies continue to have increased risk of heart failure and have residual muscle weakness including difficulties swallowing with risk of aspiration. One challenge with ERT treatment for Pompe disease is that a standard dose requires approximately twenty-fold more enzyme compared to standard doses for Fabry or Gaucher diseases. Large doses of Lumizyme that are delivered systemically in order to achieve potentially therapeutic levels in the target tissues result in approximately 90% of patients developing antibodies against the therapy. These antibody responses may impact both the efficacy and safety of Lumizyme. The FDA approval of Lumizyme carries a black box warning related to the risk of severe allergic and immune mediated reactions, including life-threatening anaphylaxis. 
 
25 


 Our Solution 
 We are in early preclinical development of AVR-RD-03 to potentially cure patients with late-onset Pompe disease. We are developing AVR-RD-03 to be a gene therapy product containing a codon-optimized human gene for GAA attached to a GILT tag designed to increase uptake of GAA in muscle cells. AVR-RD-03 will target patients with late onset Pompe disease, which represent the majority of patients with this disease. In addition, we believe that the utilization of busulfan in our conditioning regimen may have the potential to allow AVR-RD-03 to cross the blood-brain barrier, a feature which may yield therapeutic benefit. 
 Preclinical Data 
 Published preclinical results from a mouse model of Pompe disease support the potential of lentiviral-based gene expression of GAA to prevent some of the symptoms of GAA deficiency. These results also demonstrated the need to further increase the uptake of GAA into muscle cells to treat patients, which is a known challenge for ERTs and leads to the use of large quantities of enzyme to attempt to deliver effective treatment levels. 
 In these published preclinical results from a mouse model of Pompe disease, treatment utilizing a lentiviral vector encoding GAA led to increased levels of active enzyme across multiple organs and tissues, including clinically relevant tissues such as heart and diaphragm. This enzyme activity was correlated with reductions in glycogen storage in these tissues. While reduction in left ventricular mass and normalization of heart rate were observed in the mouse models seven to eight months following treatment with this lentiviral-based gene expression of GAA, only lesser improvements in other muscles, such as skeletal muscle strength, were observed. 
 We believe we can use a GILT tag to address the known challenges of skeletal muscle uptake in patients with Pompe disease. Attachment of a GILT tag to a particular protein can increase the effective uptake of that protein into target tissues. We are designing AVR-RD-03 to use a GILT tag to facilitate GAA uptake into cells and thereby reduce the therapeutically required amount of GAA produced by a patients cells following gene therapy treatment. 
 In mouse models of Pompe, administration of recombinant GAA with the GILT tag demonstrated significant reduction in glycogen in cardiac and skeletal muscles as compared to the administration of recombinant GAA alone. We licensed GILT tag technology from BioMarin and are incorporating a GILT tag into our lentiviral vector with the goal of the patient producing GILT-tagged GAA following treatment with AVR-RD-03.

 Manufacturing 
 Industrializing Our Gene Therapies Through Our Outsourced Manufacture and Supply Network 
 We are establishing global manufacturing relationships that will provide us with drug product manufacturing capabilities to support all aspects of the development and eventual commercialization of our gene therapies. Our team has leveraged their broad expertise in the manufacturing of gene and cellular therapies to build a global network of CMO partners for the development and manufacture of drug products and outsourced suppliers for the supply of vectors and plasmids. We believe that our third-party CMO partners and suppliers have capacity to accommodate current and future clinical trials and we are continuing to build a global network that will have capacity to generate sufficient quantities to meet our expected commercial needs. 
 To optimize production of our gene therapies, we are moving our cell processing to an automated, closed system using disposable supplies. We believe this industrialized manufacturing process will enable a repeatable approach through which we can design and manufacture commercially viable lentiviral gene therapies to potentially treat a large variety of genetic disorders. We expect that our automation of the manufacturing processes will further increase our CMO partners manufacturing capacity. 
 Producing a Patients Gene Therapy 
 We start the process to produce a patients gene therapy with the mobilization of a patients stem cells from the bone marrow to the blood stream and isolate them using a standard procedure used in stem cell transplants. We then treat these cells with a lentiviral vector to insert a functional copy of the gene that is defective in the target disease in a 48-hour process. We preserve patients modified cells at a very low temperature, using cryopreservation to maintain the cellular material in optimal condition until it is thawed prior to being infused into the patient. The cryopreservation allows us to conduct a number of tests to validate the modified cells prior to introducing them into the patient. We believe cryopreservation will also enable us to supply our products globally, as well as significantly increase the convenience of infusion scheduling for clinicians and patients, compared to fresh ex vivo gene therapy products that may have shelf-lives of only a few hours. 
 Prior to infusion of the gene therapy-modified cells into the patient, the patients undergo a conditioning regimen to remove some of the patients unmodified cells from the bone marrow to create sufficient space for the modified hematopoietic stem cells to engraft and produce their progeny. The conditioning regimen used in our approach for AVR-RD-01, AVR-RD-02 and AVR-RD-03 may be administered in either an inpatient or an outpatient treatment setting on a case-by-case basis as may be directed by the patients physician. 
 After the conditioning regimen is complete, the lentivirally-modified stem cells are infused into the patient by intravenous administration in an outpatient setting. After infusion, these cells engraft into the bone marrow, replicate and differentiate into all the various types of blood cells that will distribute throughout the body. These widely distributed cells lead to sustained expression of the desired therapeutic enzyme or other protein. The sustained expression of the functional enzyme or protein is a direct substitute for the protein currently delivered by ERTs, which require periodic infusions. 
 Intellectual Property and Other Barriers to Entry 
 The proprietary nature of, or protection for, our gene therapy technology, our product candidates, our production methods and supply chain are an important part of our strategy to develop and commercialize novel therapies. To maximize the commercial opportunity for our gene therapies, if approved, we and our partners have been building and continue to build barriers to entry by our competitors, including: 

 | We in-license and develop know-how, including data, relating to certain of our product candidates.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | We rely on trade secret protection to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Our management team has significant experience in cell processing and commercial-scale cellular therapy manufacturing. Leveraging this experience, we are building our global network of suppliers

and CMO partners which combines their expertise in vector manufacturing with a closed, automated manufacturing system, all utilizing CGMP.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Our gene therapies are designed to potentially provide a curative benefit. If our gene therapies are approved before any other potentially curative treatments, we believe the benefits of our approach and the resulting first mover advantage may provide meaningful disincentive for companies seeking to develop potentially curative therapies that may compete with our own. See Competition.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | We are developing therapies to treat rare diseases and expect to pursue orphan-drug designation in the United States and similar protection outside of the United States. To date, we have received from the FDA orphan-drug designation for AVR-RD-01 for the treatment of Fabry disease. These and other regulatory exclusivities, if granted or applicable, can prevent competitors, during the exclusivity period, from obtaining regulatory approval of the same drug or biological product for the same indication. See Government Regulation.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | We currently in-license, and we expect to file our own, patents and patent applications relating to certain of our product candidates.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have in-licensed patents and patent applications from BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. and GenStem Therapeutics, Inc. directed to compositions and methods related to the manufacture and use of certain of our gene therapies. In addition, we have in-licensed certain intellectual property rights and know-how from the University Health Network and affiliates of Lund University. For example, we have in-licensed know-how and data related to AVR-RD-01, including certain information about the vector and its use, from University Health Network, and we have in-licensed know-how and data related to AVR-RD-02, including certain information about the vector and its use, from certain academic scientists affiliated with Lund University. Each of our licenses are limited to particular fields, such as Fabry disease, Gaucher disease, Pompe disease, or cystinosis, and are subject to certain retained rights. We do not control the prosecution and maintenance of all of our in-licensed patents and patent applications, and our rights to enforce the patents are limited in certain ways. For additional detail regarding the risks associated with our license agreements see Risk FactorsRisks Related to Intellectual Property. 
 As of March 15, 2019, our in-licensed patent portfolio relating to certain of our gene therapies included the following: 
 

 | AVR-RD-03: two United States (U.S.) patents, projected to expire in 2022 and 2023, and one U.S. patent application, which if granted, would be projected to expire in 2029, as well as corresponding patents and patent applications in certain foreign jurisdictions, as they pertain to compositions and methods for promoting lysosomal uptake of acid alpha-glucosidase and the treatment of Pompe disease.

 The term of any given patent depends upon the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the application, subject to the timely payment of maintenance fees, among other considerations. In the United States, a patents term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed commonly owned patent. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of FDA regulatory review period. However, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. In certain foreign jurisdictions similar 
 
28 


  extensions as compensation for regulatory delays are also available. The actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a claim by claim and country by country basis for each applicable product and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. Currently, we do not own or license patents or patent applications related to our AVR-RD-01 or AVR-RD-02 product candidates. We rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets and unpatented know-how that is either owned by or licensed to us to protect our technology. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. 
 License Agreements 
 Exclusive License Agreement with University Health Network 
 In November 2016, we entered into a license agreement with University Health Network, or UHN, pursuant to which UHN granted us an exclusive worldwide license under certain intellectual property rights and a non-exclusive worldwide license under certain know-how, including certain rights to data, in each case subject to certain retained rights, to develop, commercialize and sell products for use in the treatment of Fabry disease. Intellectual property licensed to us under this agreement relates to our Fabry program.

Either we or BioMarin may terminate the license agreement if the other party commits a material breach and fails to cure such breach within a certain period of time. BioMarin may also terminate the agreement in the event of any challenge or opposition to the licensed patent rights or related actions brought by us or our affiliates or sublicensees, or if we, our affiliates or sublicensees knowingly assist a third party in challenging or otherwise opposing the licensed patent rights, except as required under a court order or subpoena. In addition, BioMarin may terminate the agreement upon our bankruptcy or insolvency. We may terminate the agreement for any reason upon notice to BioMarin. 
 License Agreement with GenStem Therapeutics, Inc. 
 In October 2017, we entered into a license agreement with GenStem Therapeutics, Inc., or GenStem, pursuant to which GenStem granted us an exclusive worldwide license, subject to certain retained rights, under certain intellectual property rights owned or controlled by GenStem related to our cystinosis program, including certain rights licensed to GenStem from the University of California, San Diego, to develop, commercialize and sell products for use in the treatment of cystinosis. Under the terms of the agreement, we must use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize one or more licensed products in the United States and in at least one country from other specified markets. We also agreed to comply with certain access requirements 
 
30 


  consistent with the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine regulations and to manufacture certain licensed products substantially in the United States. 
 As consideration for the license, we paid an initial license fee in the amount of $1 million and are required to make payments upon completion of certain development milestones up to an aggregate of $16 million. Additionally, we will pay to GenStem a tiered mid to high-single digit royalty percentage on annual net sales of licensed products as well as a low double-digit percentage of sublicense income received from certain third party sublicensees. Our royalty obligation expires on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis on the eleventh anniversary of the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country or the expiration of the last valid claim under the licensed patent rights covering such licensed product in such country, which is currently projected to occur in 2038, whichever is later. 
 Unless terminated earlier, our license agreement with GenStem will terminate upon the expiration of our royalty obligation for all licensed products throughout the world. Either we or GenStem may terminate the license agreement if the other party commits a material breach and fails to cure such breach within a certain period of time. In addition, we may terminate the agreement for any reason upon notice to GenStem. 
 Competition 
 Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our potential competitors include larger pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions. Key competitive factors affecting the commercial success of our gene therapies are likely to be efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience, price and reimbursement. 
 The market for treatment of lysosomal storage diseases is especially large and competitive. The gene therapies we are currently developing, if approved, will face competition. 
 Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a small number of our competitors. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining FDA approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors products may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any product we may commercialize and may render our gene therapies obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our gene therapies. Our competitors may also obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. Finally, the development of new treatment methods for the diseases we are targeting could render our gene therapies non-competitive or obsolete. See Risk FactorsRisks related to the discovery and development of our product candidatesWe face significant competition and our competitors may achieve regulatory approval before us or develop therapies that are more advanced or effective than ours, which may adversely affect our ability to successfully market or commercialize any of our product candidates, and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding competitors and competitive products. 
 Government Regulation 
 In the United States, biological products, including gene therapy products, are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. Both the FD&C Act and the PHS Act and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biological products. Each clinical study protocol for a gene therapy product must be reviewed by the FDA and, in some instances, the National Institute of Health, or NIH, through its Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or 
 
31 


  RAC. FDA approval must be obtained before the marketing of biological products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and we may not be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals. 
 Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, regulates gene therapy products. The CBER works closely with the NIH and its RAC, which makes recommendations to the NIH on gene therapy issues and engages in a public discussion of scientific, safety, ethical and societal issues related to proposed and ongoing gene therapy protocols. The FDA and the NIH have published guidance documents with respect to the development and submission of gene therapy protocols. The FDA also has published guidance documents related to, among other things, gene therapy products in general, their preclinical assessment, observing subjects involved in gene therapy studies for delayed adverse events, potency testing, and chemistry, manufacturing and control information in INDs for gene therapies. 
 Ethical, social and legal concerns about gene therapy, genetic testing and genetic research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the processes we may use. Federal and state agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed interest in further regulating biotechnology. More restrictive regulations or claims that our products are unsafe or pose a hazard could prevent us from commercializing any products. New government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, regulations, policies or guidance changed, or interpretations by agencies or courts changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. 
 U.S. Biological Products Development Process 
 The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
 

 | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to good laboratory practices, or GLPs, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an application for an IND, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical study site before each study may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies according to the FDAs regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical studies;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with CGMPs, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological products identity, strength, quality and purity and, if applicable, the FDAs current good tissue practices, or GTPs, for the use of human cellular and tissue products;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical study sites that generated the data in support of the BLA;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
32 


 
 | payment of user fees for FDA review of the BLA (unless a fee waiver applies); and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.
--+---------------------------------------------------

 Before testing any biological product candidate, including a gene therapy product, in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. 
 Where a gene therapy study is conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving NIH funding for recombinant DNA research, prior to the submission of an IND to the FDA, a protocol and related documentation is submitted to and the study is registered with the NIH Office of Science Policy, or OSP, pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules, or NIH Guidelines. Compliance with the NIH Guidelines is mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving NIH funds for research involving recombinant DNA; however, many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. The NIH is responsible for convening the RAC, a federal advisory committee that discusses protocols that raise novel or particularly important scientific, safety or ethical considerations, at one of its quarterly public meetings. The OSP will notify the FDA of the RACs decision regarding the necessity for full public review of a gene therapy protocol. RAC proceedings and reports are posted to the OSP web site and may be accessed by the public. 
 The clinical study sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to ship an unapproved, investigational product in interstate commerce and to administer it to humans, and must become effective before clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical study on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin. With gene therapy protocols, if the FDA allows the IND to proceed, but the RAC decides that full public review of the protocol is warranted, the FDA will request at the completion of its IND review that sponsors delay initiation of the protocol until after completion of the RAC review process. The FDA also may impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, studies may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical studies to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such studies. 
 Clinical studies involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the study sponsors control. Clinical studies are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical study will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical studies must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDAs regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical study must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical study will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical studies are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical study subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed. Clinical research involving recombinant DNA that is subject to NIH guidelines also must be reviewed by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that 
 
33 


  reviews and oversees basic and clinical research conducted at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment. 
 Clinical studies typically are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
 

 | Phase 1. The biological product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 2. The biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 3. Clinical studies are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical studies are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for approval and product labeling.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval clinical studies, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. The FDA recommends that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by ten years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire, of study subjects. 
 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical study investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, the NIH and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsors initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor, acting on its own or based on a recommendation from the sponsors data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRBs requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 Human gene therapy products are a new category of therapeutics. Because this is a relatively new and expanding area of novel therapeutic interventions, there can be no assurance as to the length of the study period, the number of patients the FDA will require to be enrolled in the studies in order to establish the safety, efficacy, purity and potency of human gene therapy products, or that the data generated in these studies will be acceptable to the FDA to support marketing approval. The NIH has a publicly accessible database, the Genetic Modification Clinical Research Information System which includes information on gene transfer studies and serves as an electronic tool to facilitate the reporting and analysis of adverse events on these studies. 
 Concurrent with clinical studies, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with CGMP requirements. To help 
 
34 


  reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 U.S. Review and Approval Processes 
 After the completion of clinical studies of a biological product, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human studies, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 
 Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. In most cases, the submission of a BLA is subject to a substantial application user fee, although the fee may be waived under certain circumstances. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, for original BLAs, the FDA has ten months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date for an application with priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the BLA is submitted to the FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a filing decision. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date. 
 Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with CGMP to assure and preserve the products identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required. 
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with CGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. For a gene therapy product, the FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with GTPs. These are FDA regulations that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based 
 
35 


  products, or HCT/Ps, which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the GTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue-based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical studies were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements. To assure CGMP, GTP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control. 
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA for a novel product (e.g., new active ingredient, new indication, etc.) must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. 
 Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical studies. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. 
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical studies, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical studies, designed to further assess a biological products safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. 
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other 
 
36 


  applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same biological product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitors product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, benefits. 
 Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval and priority review, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs and biologics that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These programs do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. To be eligible for fast track designation, new drugs and biological products must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biologic may request the FDA to designate the drug or biologic as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. One benefit of fast track designation, for example, is that the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application for a product that has received Fast Track designation on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted. 
 Under the breakthrough therapy program, products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may be eligible for the benefits of the Fast Track program when preliminary clinical evidence demonstrates that such product may have substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. Additionally, FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product receives timely advice and interactive communications to help the sponsor design and conduct a development program as efficiently as possible. 
 Any product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Under priority review, the FDAs goal is to review an application in six months, compared to ten months for a standard review. 
 Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. 
 
37 


 Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapies Designation 
 As part of the 21st Century Cures Act, enacted in December 2016, Congress amended the FD&C Act to facilitate an efficient development program for, and expedite review of regenerative medicine advanced therapies, which include cell and gene therapies, therapeutic tissue engineering products, human cell and tissue products, and combination products using any such therapies or products. Regenerative medicine advanced therapies do not include those human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products regulated solely under section 361 of the Public Health Service Act and 21 CFR Part 1271. This program is intended to facilitate efficient development and expedite review of regenerative medicine therapies, which are intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and qualify for RMAT designation. A drug sponsor may request that FDA designate a drug as a RMAT concurrently with or at any time after submission of an IND. FDA has 60 calendar days to determine whether the drug meets the criteria, including whether there is preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. A BLA for a regenerative medicine therapy that has received RMAT designation may be eligible for priority review or accelerated approval through use of surrogate or intermediate endpoints reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit, or reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites. Benefits of RMAT designation also include early interactions with FDA to discuss any potential surrogate or intermediate endpoint to be used to support accelerated approval. A regenerative medicine therapy with RMAT designation that is granted accelerated approval and is subject to post-approval requirements may fulfill such requirements through the submission of clinical evidence from clinical studies, patient registries, or other sources of real world evidence, such as electronic health records; the collection of larger confirmatory data sets; or post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with such therapy prior to its approval. Like FDAs other expedited development programs, RMAT designation does not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Maintaining substantial compliance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to CGMP. We will rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the CGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products, include reporting of CGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturers tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. 
 We also must comply with the FDAs advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the products approved labeling (known as off-label use), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development 
 
38 


  process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical holds, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors or other stakeholders, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with CGMPs and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain CGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. 
 U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the products approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved biological product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. In addition, a patent can only be extended once and only for a single product. The U.S. PTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our patents, if and as applicable, to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical studies and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA. 
 A biological product can obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods, including some regulatory exclusivity periods tied to patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued Written Request for such a study. 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or Affordable Care Act or ACA or PPACA, signed into law on March 23, 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. This amendment to the PHS Act attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference 
 
39 


  biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structure of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being worked out by the FDA. 
 A reference biological product is granted four and twelve year exclusivity periods from the time of first licensure of the product. FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product, and FDA will not approve an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until twelve years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. First licensure typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength, or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity, or potency. Therefore, one must determine whether a new product includes a modification to the structure of a previously licensed product that results in a change in safety, purity, or potency to assess whether the licensure of the new product is a first licensure that triggers its own period of exclusivity. Whether a subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the first licensure of a biological product is determined on a case-by-case basis with data submitted by the sponsor. 
 Additional Regulation 
 In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations. 
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, to which we are subject, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. 
 Government Regulation outside of the United States 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical studies and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries. 
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical studies or marketing of the 
 
40 


  product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical study application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical studies. In the European Union, for example, a Clinical Trial Application, or CTA, must be submitted for each clinical trial to each countrys national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and an IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a countrys requirements, the corresponding clinical study may proceed. 
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical studies must be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational product under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the European Union, with the exception of, among other things, region-specific document requirements. The European Union also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. For example, in the European Union, upon receiving marketing authorization, innovative medicinal products generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovators data to assess a generic or biosimilar application. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovators data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the European Unions regulatory authorities to be an innovative medicinal product, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. Products receiving orphan designation in the European Union can receive ten years of market exclusivity, during which time no similar medicinal product for the same indication may be placed on the market. An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the European Union for pediatric studies. No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications. 
 The criteria for designating an orphan medicinal product in the European Union are similar in principle to those in the United States. Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the European Union to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the European Union, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, as defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. The application for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the marketing authorization application if the orphan drug designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
 The 10-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if: 

 | The second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
41 


 
 | The applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

 For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical studies must be conducted in accordance with GCPs and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 
 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 In addition to FDA restrictions on the marketing of pharmaceutical products, we may be subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute the gene therapies for which we obtain approval. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include: 

 | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity can be found guilty of violating the statute without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act, or FCA. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the FCA, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment to, or approval by Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or an obligation to pay or transmit money to the federal government, or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to cause the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The FCA also permits a private individual acting as a whistleblower to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the anti-inducement law, which prohibits, among other things, the offering or giving of remuneration, which includes, without limitation, any transfer of items or services for free or for less than fair market value (with limited exceptions), to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiarys selection of a particular supplier of items or services reimbursable by a federal or state governmental program;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
42 


 
 | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payer (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters; similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and their respective implementing regulations, which impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the federal transparency requirements under the Affordable Care Act, including the provision commonly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Childrens Health Insurance Program to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | federal government price reporting laws, which require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics in an accurate and timely manner to government programs; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Additionally, we are subject to state and foreign equivalents of each of the healthcare laws described above, among others, some of which may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of the payer. Many U.S. states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source, not just governmental payers, including private insurers. In addition, some states have passed laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the April 2003 Office of Inspector General Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and/or the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of Americas Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals. Several states also impose other marketing restrictions or require pharmaceutical companies to make marketing or price disclosures to the state. There are ambiguities as to what is required to comply with these state requirements and if we fail to comply with an applicable state law requirement we could be subject to penalties. Finally, there are state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. 
 Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including penalties, fines, imprisonment and/or exclusion or suspension from federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and debarment from contracting with the U.S. government. In addition, private 
 
43 


  individuals have the ability to bring actions on behalf of the U.S. government under the federal False Claims Act as well as under the false claims laws of several states. 
 Law enforcement authorities are increasingly focused on enforcing fraud and abuse laws, and it is possible that some of our practices may be challenged under these laws. Efforts to ensure that our current and future business arrangements with third parties, and our business generally, will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices, including our arrangements with physicians and other healthcare providers, some of whom receive stock options as compensation for services provided, may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. In addition, the approval and commercialization of any of our gene therapies outside the United States will also likely subject us to foreign equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above, among other foreign laws. 
 If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs, which may also adversely affect our business. 
 Regulators globally are also imposing greater monetary fines for privacy violations. For example, in 2016, the European Union adopted a new regulation governing data practices and privacy called the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. Non-compliance with the GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to 20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. Notably, on January 21, 2019, Google was fined almost $57 million by French regulators for violating GDPR. 
 European Data Collection 
 The collection and use of personal health data in the European Union is governed by the provisions of the Data Protection Directive, and as of May 25, 2018 the GDPR. The GDPR applies to any company established in the European Union as well as to those outside the European Union if they collect and use personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to individuals in the European Union or the monitoring of their behavior. The GDPR enhances data protection obligations for processors and controllers of personal data, including, for example, expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used, limitations on retention of information, mandatory data breach notification requirements and onerous new obligations on services providers. Non-compliance with the GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to 20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. The GDPR and other changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of personal data, such as healthcare data or other sensitive information, could greatly increase our cost of providing our products and services or even prevent us from offering certain services in jurisdictions that we may operate in. 
Healthcare Reform 
 A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payers have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products. For example, in March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; introduced a new methodology by which rebates owed by 
 
44 


  manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans; created a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 70% (as of 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for manufacturers outpatient drugs coverage under Medicare Part D; subjects drug manufacturers to new annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies share of sales to federal healthcare programs; imposes a new federal excise tax on the sale of certain medical devices; created a new Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established the Center for Medicare Innovation at Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending. 
 Since its enactment, there have been a number of significant changes to the Affordable Care Act. As a result, there have been delays in the implementation of, and action taken to repeal or replace, certain aspects of the ACA. On January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. On October 13, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order terminating the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the Affordable Care Act. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017. Further, on June 14, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than $12 billion in ACA risk corridor payments asserted to be owed to third-party payors. In addition, CMS finalized regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the Affordable Care Act for plans sold through such marketplaces. On November 30, 2018, CMS announced a proposed rule that would amend the Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit regulations to reduce out of pocket costs for plan enrollees and allow Medicare plans to negotiate lower rates for certain drugs. Among other things, the proposed rule changes would allow Medicare Advantage plans to use pre-authorization (PA) and step therapy (ST) for six protected classes of drugs, with certain exceptions, permit plans to implement PA and ST in Medicare Part B drugs, and change the definition of negotiated prices and add a definition of price concession to the regulations. It is unclear whether these proposed changes will be accepted, and if so, what effect such changes will have on our business. 
 The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or TCJA, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the individual mandate. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, or the Texas District Court Judge, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the Affordable Care Act, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. While the Trump Administration and CMS have both stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, and on December 30, 2018 the Texas District Court Judge issued an order staying the judgment pending appeal, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals and other efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act will impact the Affordable Care Act and our business. Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called Cadillac tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plan, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device exercise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to reduce the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the donut hole. Congress will likely consider other legislation to replace or modify elements of the Affordable Care Act. We continue to evaluate the 
 
45 


  effect that the Affordable Care Act and its possible repeal, replacement or further modification could have on our business. It is uncertain the extent to which any such changes may impact our business or financial condition. 
 In addition, the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 led to aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year that will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Further, on January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. More recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in proposing and passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
 Finally, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA -approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act, but the manufacturer must develop an internal policy and respond to patient requests according to that policy. 
 We expect that additional foreign, federal and state healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that foreign federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in limited coverage and reimbursement and reduced demand for our products, if approved, or additional pricing pressures. 
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any gene therapies for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any gene therapies for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. Third-party payers include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the product. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. A decision by a third-party payer not to cover our gene therapies could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, a payers decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 
 In addition, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payer to payer. One third-party payers decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payers will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. 
 
46 


 As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payer separately and will be a time-consuming process. 
 Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain and maintain coverage and reimbursement for any product, we may need to conduct expensive clinical trials in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of such product, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. If third-party payers do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit. 
 Outside of the United States, the pricing of pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control in many countries. For example, in the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular therapy to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. Other countries may allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control product volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Efforts to control prices and utilization of pharmaceutical products and medical devices will likely continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 49 full-time employees, 20 of whom have Ph.D. or M.D. degrees. Of these full-time employees, 35 employees are engaged in research and development activities and 14 employees are engaged in finance, legal, human resources, facilities and general management. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees and we have not experienced any work stoppages. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 
Website Access to Reports 
 We are subject to the informational requirements of the Exchange Act and are required to file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC.
