Overview

Prudential Financial, Inc., a financial services leader with approximately $1.377 trillion of assets under management as of December 31, 2018, has operations in the United States, Asia, Europe and Latin America. Through our subsidiaries and affiliates, we offer a wide array of financial products and services, including life insurance, annuities, retirement-related products and services, mutual funds and investment management. We offer these products and services to individual and institutional customers through proprietary and third-party distribution networks. Our principal executive offices are located in Newark, New Jersey, and our common stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “PRU”.

On December 18, 2001, Prudential Insurance converted from a mutual life insurance company owned by its policyholders to a stock life insurance company and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial. The demutualization was carried out under Prudential Insurance’s Plan of Reorganization, which required us to establish and operate a regulatory mechanism known as the “Closed Block.” The Closed Block includes certain in-force participating insurance and annuity products and corresponding assets that are used for the payment of benefits and policyholders’ dividends on these products, as well as certain related assets and liabilities.
Our principal operations are comprised of five divisions, which together encompass seven segments, and our Corporate and Other operations. The PGIM division is comprised of our PGIM segment (formerly named the “Investment Management” segment). The U.S. Workplace Solutions division consists of our Retirement and Group Insurance segments. The U.S. Individual Solutions division consists of our Individual Annuities and Individual Life segments. The International Insurance division consists of our International Insurance segment, and the Closed Block division consists of our Closed Block segment. Our Corporate and Other operations include corporate items and initiatives that are not allocated to business segments and businesses that have been or will be divested or placed in run-off. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for revenues, income and loss, and total assets by segment.
Our strategy centers on our mix of high-quality protection, retirement and investment management businesses which creates growth potential due to earnings diversification and the opportunity to provide customers with integrated cross-business solutions, as well as capital benefits from a balanced risk profile. We are well positioned to meet the needs of customers and tap into significant market opportunities through our U.S. Financial Wellness businesses (represented by our U.S. Workplace Solutions and U.S. Individual Solutions Divisions), PGIM (our investment management business) and our International Insurance business. We see an opportunity to address the evolving needs of individual customers, workplace clients, and society at large through our increasingly important financial wellness solutions. We possess the key components to execute on this strategy, including a workplace platform covering twenty million individuals; solutions that cover protection, retirement, savings, income, and investment needs; and a customer-centric approach with different ways to engage with our clients through multiple channels such as meeting with one of our financial advisors, calling or video-conferencing with an advisor, or interacting with us in a purely digital manner. Our goal is to meet our customers’ needs when, where and how they want. By leveraging technology and our scale, we aim to significantly expand the addressable market, build deeper and longer-lasting relationships with customers and clients, and make a meaningful difference in the financial wellness of their lives.

PGIM Segment (Continued)

Revenues and ProfitabilityOur revenues primarily come from:•Asset management fees which are typically calculated based upon a percentage of assets under management. In certain asset management arrangements, we also receive performance-based incentive fees when the return on the managed assets exceeds certain benchmark returns or other performance targets. •Transaction fees earned as a percentage of the transaction price associated with the sale or purchase of assets in certain funds, primarily related to real estate and private fixed income.•Investment returns from strategic investing.•Revenues from commercial mortgage origination and servicing.Our profitability is substantially impacted by:•Macro market movement (e.g. interest rates and equity market performance).•Our ability to achieve investment returns above the target benchmarks.•Our ability to attract and retain customer investments. | CompetitionWe compete with numerous asset managers and other financial institutions. For our investment management products, we compete based on a number of factors, including investment performance, strategy and process, talent, organizational stability and client relationships. We offer products across multiple asset classes, with specialized investment teams that employ approaches designed to add value in each product area or asset class. Our organizational stability and robust institutional and retail businesses have helped attract and retain talent critical to delivering investment results for clients.

Provides retirement investment and income products and services to retirement plan sponsors in the public, private and not-for-profit sectors.

ProductsFull Service•A broad range of products and services to assist in the design, delivery and administration of defined contribution, defined benefit and non-qualified retirement plans.•Recordkeeping and administrative services, actuarial advisory services, tailored participant education and communication services, comprehensive investment offerings and consulting services to assist retirement plan sponsors in managing fiduciary obligations.•Investment products including a variety of general and separate account stable value products, other fee-based products through which customer funds are held in separate accounts, retail mutual funds, institutional funds or bank collective trusts advised by affiliated and non-affiliated investment managers, as well as synthetic guaranteed investment contracts, and guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit products.Institutional Investment Products•Payout Annuities: products that provide a predictable source of monthly income, generally for the life of the participant◦Pension risk transfer - non-participating group annuity insurance contracts issued to pension plan sponsors under which we assume all investment and actuarial risk associated with a group of specified participants within a plan in return for a premium typically paid as a lump-sum at inception.◦Pension risk transfer - longevity reinsurance contracts from which we earn a fee for assuming the longevity risk of pension plans that have been insured by third-parties.

Retirement Segment (Continued)

Underwriting and PricingOur revenues primarily come in the form of:•Premiums associated with insurance and reinsurance contracts and our payout annuities.•Policy charges and fee income associated with recordkeeping and other administrative services, and investment products (including fee-based stable value) that we offer. Policy charges and fees are primarily based on account values and/or number of participants.•Investment income (which contributes to the net spread over interest credited on certain stable value products and related expenses.)Our profitability is substantially impacted by our ability to appropriately price our products. We price our products based on: •Pricing models that consider the investment environment and our risk, fees, expenses and profitability targets for our full service and institutional investment products.◦For products within our payout annuity area, our models also use assumptions for mortality and, if pertinent, early retirement risks. These assumptions may be less predictable in certain markets, and deviations in actual experience from pricing assumptions could affect the profitability of these products.◦For our investment-only stable value wrap product, our pricing risk is mitigated by several features:▪under the contracts, we have the ability to periodically reset the crediting rates, subject to a 0% minimum floor, as well as the ability to increase fees;▪generally, the contracts allow participants to withdraw funds at book value, while contractholder withdrawals occur at market value immediately or at book value over time; and▪our obligation is limited to payments that are in excess of the fund value. | CompetitionWe compete with other large, well-established insurance companies, asset managers, recordkeepers and diversified financial institutions. Full Service - we compete primarily based on:•pricing•the breadth of our service and investment offerings•the expertise of our employees•investment performance•our ability to offer product features to meet the retirement income needs of our clientsWhile we continue to have heightened pricing pressures (driven by competition, contractual limits on fee income, the influence of intermediaries and regulations requiring more standard and consistent fee disclosures across industry providers), this business has experienced strong persistency in recent years. Institutional Investment Products - we compete primarily based on:•our pricing•structuring capabilities•our ability to offer innovative product solutions and successfully execute large-scale transactionsSales of institutional investment products are affected by competitive factors such as:•investment performance•company credit and financial strength ratings•product design•marketplace visibility•distribution capabilities •fees•crediting rates•customer serviceWe are a leader in providing innovative pension risk management solutions to plan sponsors and in the stable value wrap market. We believe the pension risk transfer market continues to offer attractive opportunities that are aligned with our expertise.

Group Insurance Segment

Provides a full range of group life, long-term and short-term group disability, and group corporate-, bank- and trust-owned life insurance in the U.S. primarily to institutional clients for use in connection with employee plans and affinity groups. Also sells accidental death and dismemberment and other ancillary coverages, and provides plan administrative services in connection with our insurance coverages.

ProductsGroup Life Insurance•Employer-paid and employee-paid coverages for term life insurance, group universal life, group variable universal life, basic and voluntary accidental death and dismemberment insurance, critical illness and accident insurance. •Many of our employee-paid coverages allow employees to retain their coverage when they change employers or retire, and we offer waiver of premium coverage where required premiums are waived in the event the insured suffers a qualifying disability. •Group corporate-, bank- and trust-owned life insurance products in the form of group variable life insurance contracts utilizing separate accounts. These products are typically used by large corporations to fund deferred compensation plans and benefit plans for retired employees.Group Disability Insurance•Short-term and long-term group disability insurance which protects against loss of wages due to illness or injury. Short-term disability generally provides weekly benefits for three to six months while long-term disability benefits are typically paid monthly, following a waiting period and generally continue until the insured returns to work or reaches normal retirement age. •Plan administration and absence management services. | Marketing and DistributionWe primarily distribute products through a proprietary sales force organized around market segments in conjunction with employee benefit brokers and consultants.

Group Insurance Segment (Continued)

Underwriting and PricingOur revenues primarily come in the form of:•Premiums and policy charges for our group life and disability products.•Investment income (which contributes to the net spread over interest credited on our products and related expenses).Our profitability is substantially impacted by our ability to appropriately price our products. We price our products based on: •Underwriting practices and rating systems that consider company, industry and/or other experience. We assess the risk profile of prospective insured groups; however, certain voluntary products or coverages may require underwriting on an individual basis. We are not obligated to accept any individual certificate application and may require a prospective insured to submit evidence of insurability. •The expected pay-out of benefits and other costs that we calculate using assumptions for mortality and morbidity rates, interest rates and expenses, depending upon the specific product features. On many of our group policies, we provide multiple year premium rate guarantees, which can contribute to fluctuations in profitability. For certain policies with experience-rated premium return provisions, the final premium is adjusted to reflect the group policyholder’s actual experience during the past year. For these policies, the group contractholder bears some of the risk, or receives some of the benefit, associated with claim experience fluctuations, thus lessening the fluctuations in profitability. | CompetitionWe compete with other large, well-established life and health insurance providers in mature markets. We compete primarily based on brand recognition, service capabilities, customer relationships, financial strength, range of product offerings and price. Pricing of group insurance products is reflective of the large number of competitors in the marketplace. The majority of our premiums are derived from large corporations, affinity groups or other organizations having over 5,000 insured individuals, which we refer to as the National segment. We are also seeking to grow our client base with institutions that have between 100 and 5,000 individuals, which we refer to as the Premier segment. Employee-paid coverage is important as employers attempt to control costs and shift benefit decisions and funding to employees who continue to value benefits offered at the workplace. Our profitability is dependent, in part, on the voluntary coverage marketplace, which will be affected by future employment and compensation rates.

Individual Annuities Segment
Develops and distributes individual variable and fixed annuity products, primarily to the U.S. mass affluent (households with investable assets or annual income in excess of $100,000) and affluent (households with investable assets in excess of $250,000) markets with a focus on innovative product design and risk management strategies.

ProductsWe offer a variety of products to serve different retirement needs and goals.Variable Annuities •The Prudential Premier® Retirement Variable Annuity with Highest Daily Lifetime Income (“HDI”) offers lifetime income based on the highest daily account value plus a compounded deferral credit.•Prudential Defined Income® (“PDI”) Variable Annuity provides for guaranteed lifetime withdrawal payments, but restricts contractholder investment to a single bond sub-account within the separate accounts. PDI includes a living benefit rider which provides for a specified lifetime income withdrawal rate applied to purchase payment(s) paid, subject to annual roll-up increases until lifetime withdrawals commence, but does not have a highest daily benefit feature as discussed below.•Prudential Premier® Investment Variable Annuity (“PPI”) offers tax-deferred asset accumulation, annuitization options and an optional death benefit that guarantees the contractholder’s beneficiary a return of total purchase payments made to the contract, adjusted for any partial withdrawals, upon death. •Prudential Premier® Retirement Variable Annuity with Legacy Protection Plus (“LPP”) provides an optional enhanced death benefit based on the purchase payments rolling up at a preset rate on an annual basis until certain events occur, such as the death of the first owner (or annuitant if entity-owned) or the roll-up cap is reached. LPP cannot be elected together with any of the other optional living or death benefits we offer.Fixed Annuities:•In January 2018, the Company launched PruSecureSM, a single premium fixed index annuity, which allows the contractholder to allocate all or a portion of their account balance into an index-based strategy, such as the S&P 500. The index-based strategy provides interest or an interest component linked to, but not an investment in, the selected index, and its performance over the elected term (i.e., 1, 3 or 5 years), subject to certain contractual minimums and maximums.•In March 2018, the Company launched Guaranteed Income For Tomorrow (“GIFT”)®, a deferred income annuity. Each contribution purchases increments of guaranteed lifetime income that starts on a future date chosen at issue by the owner and continues for life.•Prudential Immediate Income Annuity (“PIIA”), a single premium immediate annuity, provides a regular stream of benefit payments. The payments are guaranteed and cannot be changed, and are higher than those guaranteed on products that provide liquidity. | Marketing and DistributionOur distribution efforts, which are supported by a network of internal and external wholesalers, are executed through a diverse group of distributors including:•Third-party broker-dealers •Banks and wirehouses•Independent financial planners•Financial professionals, including those associated with Prudential Advisors, Prudential’s proprietary nationwide sales organization•Direct response solicitation through our Group Insurance business and online (specifically for our GIFT product)

Individual Annuities Segment (Continued)

Underwriting and PricingOur revenues primarily come in the form of:•Fee income from asset management fees, as well as service fees, representing administrative service and distribution fees from many of our proprietary and non-proprietary mutual funds. The asset management fees are determined as a percentage of the average assets of our proprietary mutual funds in our variable annuity products (net of sub-advisory expenses related to non-proprietary sub-advisors).•Policy charges and fee income representing mortality, expense and other fees for various insurance-related options and features based on the average daily net asset value of the annuity separate accounts, account value, premium, or guaranteed value, as applicable.•Investment income (which contributes to the net spread over interest credited on certain of our products and related expenses).Our profitability is substantially impacted by our ability to appropriately price our products. We price our products based on: •An evaluation of the risks assumed and consideration of applicable risk management strategies, including hedging and reinsurance costs.•Assumptions regarding investment returns and contractholder behavior, including persistency (the probability that a contract will remain in force), benefit utilization and the timing and efficiency of withdrawals for contracts with living benefit features, as well as other assumptions. | CompetitionWe are among the industry’s largest providers of individual annuities and we compete with other providers of retirement savings and accumulation products, including large, well-established insurance and financial services companies. We believe our competitive advantage lies primarily in our innovative product features and our risk management strategies as well as brand recognition, financial strength, the breadth of our distribution platform and our customer service capabilities.

Individual Life Segment

Develops and distributes term life, variable life and universal life insurance products primarily to the U.S. mass middle (households with investable assets in excess of $25,000 or annual income in excess of $50,000), mass affluent (households with investable assets or annual income in excess of $100,000) and affluent (households with investable assets in excess of $250,000) with a focus on providing life insurance solutions to protect individuals, families and businesses and to support estate and wealth transfer planning.

ProductsWe offer a variety of products that serve different protection needs and goals.Term Life - coverage for a specified number of years with a guaranteed tax-advantaged death benefit•Most of our term life policies offer an income tax-free death benefit, guaranteed premiums that will stay the same during the level-premium period and access to the death benefit while the policyholder is still alive to help them if they become terminally ill. •Most of our term life policies offer a conversion option that allows the policyholder to convert the policy into a permanent policy that can potentially cover the insured for life.Variable Life - permanent coverage for life with potential to accumulate policy cash value based on underlying investment options•Our variable life policies offer flexibility in how much and when the policyholder pays premiums and the potential to accumulate cash value through a choice of over 50 underlying investment options or a fixed rate option. •We offer three types of variable life policies that, in addition to the death benefit, are tailored to prioritize different goals such as protection with moderate risk, growth with higher risk or legacy giving.Universal Life - permanent coverage for life with the potential to accumulate policy cash value•Our universal life policies offer flexibility in how much and when the policyholder pays premiums and the potential to accumulate cash value in an account that earns interest based on a crediting rate determined by the Company subject to contractual minimums. •Guaranteed universal life policies provide a guarantee that the policy will remain in force when it would otherwise lapse due to insufficient cash value. •Indexed universal life policies provide interest credited to the cash value that is linked to, but not an investment in, the S&P 500® - index performance over a 1-year period subject to certain participation rates and contractual minimums/maximums. | Marketing and DistributionWe primarily distribute products through the following two channels: •Third-party distribution ◦Independent brokers◦Banks and wirehouses◦General agencies and producer groups•Prudential Advisors◦Prudential’s proprietary nationwide sales organization that distributes Prudential life insurance, annuities and investment products with proprietary and non-proprietary investment options as well as select insurance and investment products from other carriers. ◦Offers certain retail brokerage and retail investment advisory services (through our dually registered broker-dealer and investment advisor, Pruco Securities, LLC) including brokerage accounts, discretionary and non-discretionary investment advisory programs and financial planning services. ◦Continues to execute a solutions-oriented business model centered around client relationships, while strengthening and driving Prudential’s brand promise across the country. ◦Receives a market based allowance from other Prudential business segments for distributing their products which is eliminated between the segments in consolidation.

Individual Life Segment (Continued)

Underwriting and PricingOur revenues primarily come in the form of:•Premiums that are fixed or flexible in accordance with the terms of the policies. •Policy charges and fee income consisting of in-force policy- and/or asset-based fees. •Investment income (which contributes to the net spread over interest credited on our products and related expenses).Our profitability is substantially impacted by our ability to appropriately price our products. We price our products based on: •Our assumptions of mortality and morbidity, persistency, interest rates, expenses, premium payment patterns, separate account fund performance, product generated tax deductions, as well as the level, cost and availability of financing for certain statutory reserves. | CompetitionWe compete with other large, well-established life insurance companies in a mature market. We compete primarily based on price, service, including the speed and ease of underwriting, distribution channel relationships, brand recognition and financial strength. Due to the large number of competitors, pricing is competitive. We periodically adjust product prices and features based on the market and our strategy, with a goal of managing the Individual Life business for steady, consistent sales growth across a balanced product portfolio and to avoid over-concentration in any one product type.


12

International Insurance Segment

Develops and distributes life insurance, retirement products and certain accident and health products with fixed benefits to the mass affluent and affluent markets through our Life Planner operations in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. Also provides similar products to the broad middle income and mass affluent markets across Japan, our joint ventures in Chile, Malaysia, India and Indonesia, and our strategic investment in Ghana through multiple distribution channels including banks, independent agencies and Life Consultants associated with our Gibraltar Life and Other operations.

ProductsOur products are classified into the following four categories:Life Insurance Protection Products - include various traditional whole life products that provide either level or increasing coverage, and that offer limited or lifetime premium payment options. We also offer increasing, decreasing and level benefit term insurance products that provide coverage for a specified time period, as well as protection-oriented variable universal life products. Some of these protection products are denominated in U.S. dollars and some are sold as bundled products which, in addition to death protection, include health benefits or savings elements.Retirement Products - include retirement income products which combine insurance protection similar to term life with a lifetime income stream which commences at a predefined age, savings-oriented variable universal life products which provide a non-guaranteed return linked to an underlying investment portfolio of equity and fixed income funds selected by the customer, and endowments which provide payment of the face amount on the earlier of death or policy maturity.Annuity Products - primarily represented by U.S. dollar- and Australian dollar-denominated fixed annuities sold by our Gibraltar Life operations in Japan, and Korean won- and U.S. dollar-denominated variable annuities sold by our Life Planner operation in Korea. Sales and surrenders of non-yen products can be sensitive to foreign currency relationships which are impacted by, among other things, the comparative interest rates in the respective countries. Most of our fixed annuity products impose a market value adjustment if the contract is not held to maturity.Accident and Health Products - provide benefits to cover accidental death and dismemberment, hospitalization, surgeries, and cancer and other dread diseases, often sold as supplementary riders and not as stand-alone products. We also offer waiver of premium coverage where required premiums are waived in the event the customer suffers a qualifying disability. | Marketing and DistributionProprietary agent models:•Life Planners - focuses on selling protection-oriented life insurance products on a needs basis to mass affluent and affluent customers, as well as retirement-oriented products to small businesses. We believe that our recruiting and selection process, training programs and compensation packages are key to the Life Planner model and have helped our Life Planner operations achieve higher levels of agent retention, agent productivity and policy persistency. •Life Consultants - is a proprietary distribution force for products offered by our Gibraltar Life operations. Their focus is to provide individual protection products to the broad middle income market, primarily in Japan, particularly through relationships with affinity groups. Our Life Consultant operation is based on a variable compensation plan designed to improve productivity and persistency that is similar to compensation plans in our Life Planner operations.Third-party channels:•Bank Distribution Channel - primarily consists of life insurance products intended to provide savings features, premature death protection and estate planning benefits as well as fixed annuity products primarily denominated in U.S. dollars and Australian dollars. We view the bank distribution channel as an adjunct to our core Life Planner and Life Consultant distribution channels. A significant portion of our sales in Japan through our bank channel distribution are derived through a single Japanese mega-bank; however, we have relationships with each of Japan’s four largest banks as well as many regional banks, and we continue to explore opportunities to expand our distribution capabilities through this channel, as appropriate.•Independent Agency Distribution Channel - sells protection products and high cash value products for retirement benefits through the business market and also sells a variety of other products including protection, medical and fixed annuity products through the individual market. Our focus is to maintain a diverse mix of independent agency relationships including corporate agencies and other independent agencies with a balanced focus on individual and business markets.

International Insurance Segment (Continued)

Underwriting and PricingOur revenues primarily come in the form of:•Premiums that are fixed or flexible in accordance with the terms of the policies.•Policy charges and fee income consisting of in-force policy- and/or asset-based fees. •Investment income (which contributes to the net spread over interest credited on our products and related expenses).Our profitability is substantially impacted by our ability to appropriately price our products. We price our products based on: •Local regulation that is generally more restrictive for product offerings, pricing and structure than U.S. insurance regulation. Each International Insurance operation has its own underwriting department that employs variations of U.S. practices in underwriting individual policy risks. To the extent permitted by local regulation, we base premiums and policy charges for our products on expected death and morbidity benefits, surrender benefits, expenses, required reserves, interest rates, policy persistency and premium payment patterns. In setting underwriting limits, we also consider local industry standards to prevent adverse selection and to stay abreast of industry trends. In addition, we set underwriting limits together with each operation’s reinsurers. •Achieving a targeted rate of return for each country, taking into account the country-specific costs of capital, risks, and competitive environment. The profitability of our products is impacted by differences between actual mortality, morbidity, expense, and investment experience and the related assumptions used in pricing these policies. As a result, the profitability of our products can fluctuate from period to period. Changes in local tax laws may also affect profitability. | CompetitionThe life insurance markets in Japan and Korea are mature and pricing is competitive. Rather than competing primarily based on price, we generally compete on the basis of customer service, including our needs-based approach to selling, the quality and diversity of our distribution capabilities, and our financial strength. Demographic trends in Asia suggest an increasing opportunity for product innovation, introducing insurance products that allow for savings and income as a growing portion of the population prepares for retirement. The ability to sell through multiple and complementary distribution channels is also a competitive advantage; however, competition for sales personnel, as well as access to third-party distribution channels, is intense.

Corporate and Other Operations

Includes corporate items and initiatives that are not allocated to our business segments and businesses that have been or will be divested or placed in run-off, except for the Closed Block. Results of the Closed Block, along with certain related assets and liabilities, are reported as the Closed Block division separately from the divested and run-off businesses included in Corporate and Other Operations.
Corporate Operations - consist primarily of: (1) capital that is not deployed in any business segment; (2) investments not allocated to business segments, including debt-financed investment portfolios, and tax credit and other tax-enhanced investments financed by business segments; (3) capital debt that is used or will be used to meet the capital requirements of the Company and the related interest expense; (4) our qualified and non-qualified pension and other employee benefit plans, after allocations to business segments; (5) corporate-level activities, after allocations to business segments, including strategic expenditures, corporate governance, corporate advertising, philanthropic activities, deferred compensation, and costs related to certain contingencies and enhanced regulatory supervision; (6) certain retained obligations relating to pre-demutualization policyholders; (7) our ownership interest in a life insurance joint venture in China; (8) our Capital Protection Framework; (9) the foreign currency income hedging program used to hedge certain non-U.S. dollar denominated earnings in our International Insurance segment; (10) the impact of intercompany arrangements with our PGIM segment to translate certain non-U.S. dollar-denominated earnings at fixed currency exchange rates; and (11) transactions with and between other segments, including the elimination of intercompany transactions for consolidation purposes.
Divested and Run-off Businesses - reflect the results of businesses that have been, or will be, sold or exited, including businesses that have been placed in wind down status that do not qualify for “discontinued operations” accounting treatment under Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). We exclude these results from our adjusted operating income. Divested and Run-off Businesses include: 

• | Long-Term Care: In 2012, we discontinued sales of our individual and group long-term care insurance products. We establish reserves for these products in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We use best estimate assumptions as of the most recent loss recognition date when establishing reserves for future policyholder benefits and expenses, including assumptions for morbidity, mortality, mortality improvement, persistency, expenses and interest rates. Our assumptions also include our estimate of the timing and amount of anticipated future premium rate increases and policyholder benefit reductions which will require approval by state regulatory authorities. Reserves also include claims reported but not yet paid and claims incurred but not yet reported.


• | Other:


◦ | In 2018, we sold our Pramerica of Poland subsidiary.


◦ | In 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Pramerica of Italy subsidiary subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. In February 2019, the agreement was terminated and we continue to explore strategic alternatives. 


◦ | In 2018, we exited our PGIM Brazil operations including the sale of our minority interest in a Brazilian asset management joint venture.


◦ | In 2008, we announced our intention to exit our financial advisory business, which consisted of our investment in a retail securities brokerage and clearing operations joint venture which we sold on December 31, 2009. Certain expenses relating to the businesses we originally contributed to the joint venture were retained, primarily for litigation and regulatory matters.


◦ | In 2003, we sold our property and casualty insurance companies to Liberty Mutual Group (“Liberty Mutual”). We have reinsured Liberty Mutual for adverse loss development for specific property and casualty risks that they did not want to retain.


◦ | In 1993, we ceased writing hospital expense and major medical policies. For our hospital expense and major medical policies, the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act guarantees renewal beyond age 65. Under certain circumstances, with appropriate approvals from state regulatory authorities, we are permitted to change the premiums charged for these policies if we can demonstrate the premiums have not been sufficient to pay claims.


◦ | In the early 1990s we ceased our active engagement in the assumed life reinsurance market in the United States; however, we remain subject to mortality risk for certain assumed individual life insurance policies under the terms of the reinsurance treaties.


15

Closed Block Division

In connection with the demutualization in 2001, we ceased offering domestic participating individual life insurance and annuity products, under which policyholders are eligible to receive policyholder dividends reflecting experience. The liabilities for our individual in-force participating products were segregated, together with assets to be used exclusively for the payment of benefits and policyholder dividends, expenses and taxes with respect to these products, in the Closed Block. We selected the amount of assets that were expected to generate sufficient cash flow, together with anticipated revenues from the Closed Block policies, over the life of the Closed Block to fund payments of all policyholder benefits, expenses and taxes, and to provide for the continuation of the policyholder dividend scales in effect in 2000, assuming experience underlying such scales continued. No policies sold after demutualization have been added to the Closed Block, and its in-force business is expected to decline as we pay policyholder benefits in full.
The results of the Closed Block, along with certain related assets and liabilities, comprise the Closed Block division, which is treated as a divested business under our definition of adjusted operating income and reported separately from the other divested and run-off businesses that are included in our Corporate and Other operations. 

As discussed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, if the performance of the Closed Block is more or less favorable than we originally assumed in funding, total dividends paid to Closed Block policyholders in the future may be greater or less than the total dividends that would have been paid to these policyholders if the policyholder dividend scales in effect in 2000 had been continued. Any experience in excess of amounts assumed may be available for distribution over time to Closed Block policyholders as part of policyholder dividends unless offset by future Closed Block experience that is less favorable than expected. This excess experience will not be available to shareholders. If the Closed Block has insufficient funds to make guaranteed policy benefit payments, such payments will be made from Prudential Insurance’s assets outside of the Closed Block. A policyholder dividend obligation liability is established for any excess experience. Each year, the Board of Directors of Prudential Insurance determines the dividends payable on participating policies for the following year based on the experience of the Closed Block, including investment income, net realized and unrealized investment gains and losses, mortality experience and other factors. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for revenues, income and loss, and total assets of the Closed Block division.

Our strategy is to maintain the Closed Block as required by our Plan of Reorganization over the time period of its gradual diminution as policyholder benefits are paid in full. We are permitted under the Plan of Reorganization, with the prior consent of the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance for the State of New Jersey, to enter into agreements to transfer all or any part of the risks under the Closed Block policies.

Reinsurance
We regularly enter into reinsurance agreements as either the ceding entity or the assuming entity. As a ceding entity, exposure to the risks reinsured is reduced by transferring certain rights and obligations of the underlying insurance product to a counterparty. As an assuming entity, exposure to the risks reinsured is increased by assuming certain rights and obligations of the underlying insurance products from a counterparty. We enter into reinsurance agreements as the ceding entity for a variety of reasons but primarily to reduce exposure to loss, reduce risk volatility, provide additional capacity for future growth and for capital management purposes. Under ceded reinsurance, we remain liable to the underlying policyholder if a third-party reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations. On a Company-wide basis, we evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers and monitor the concentration of counterparty risk to mitigate this exposure. We enter into reinsurance agreements as the assuming entity as part of our normal product offerings (e.g., certain pension risk transfer products in the Retirement segment) or in order to facilitate an acquisition of a block of business.
The following table summarizes our use of reinsurance in each of our insurance reporting segments.

Segment | Primary typeof reinsurance | Purpose 
Retirement | Assumed | Assumed reinsurance as part of our longevity reinsurance pension risk transfer product and in conjunction with our 2004 acquisition of CIGNA’s defined benefit and defined contribution business. 
Group Insurance | Ceded | Ceded reinsurance on most products to limit losses from large claims, in response to client requests and for capital management purposes. 
Individual Annuities | Ceded/Assumed | Ceded reinsurance to reduce exposure to our HDI v.3.0 variable annuity business issued between April 1, 2015 to December 31, 2016. Assumed reinsurance in conjunction with our 2006 acquisition of The Allstate Corporation’s (“Allstate”) annuity business and internal ceded and assumed reinsurance as part of our risk and capital management activities. 
Individual Life | Ceded/Assumed | Ceded reinsurance with both third-party reinsurers and affiliates covering a variety of products to mitigate mortality risk and for capital management purposes. On policies sold since 2000, we have reinsured a significant portion of the mortality risk assumed, with that portion varying over time depending on market factors and strategic objectives. Assumed reinsurance in conjunction with our 2013 acquisition of the Hartford Life business.
International Insurance | Ceded | Ceded reinsurance with both third-party reinsurers and affiliates to mitigate mortality risk for certain protection products and for capital management purposes. 
Closed Block | Ceded | Prudential Insurance reinsures substantially all of the outstanding liabilities of the Closed Block into a statutory guaranteed separate account of a wholly-owned subsidiary, Prudential Legacy Insurance Company of New Jersey (“PLIC”), primarily on a coinsurance basis. The reinsurance transaction provides a long-term and comprehensive capital framework for the Closed Block. 

Intangible and Intellectual Property

We capture and protect the innovation in our financial services products by applying for federal business method patents and implementing trade secret controls, as appropriate. We also use numerous federal, state, common law and foreign servicemarks, including in particular “Prudential”, the “Prudential logo”, our “Rock” symbol and “PGIM”. We believe that the value associated with many of our patents and trade secrets, and the goodwill associated with many of our servicemarks are significant competitive assets.
Since 2004, we have had an agreement with Prudential plc of the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), with whom we have no affiliation, concerning the parties’ respective rights worldwide to use the names “Prudential” and “Pru.” The agreement restricts use of the “Prudential” and “Pru” name and mark in a number of countries outside the Americas, including Europe and most parts of Asia. Where these limitations apply, we combine our “Rock” symbol with alternative word marks. We believe that these limitations do not materially affect our ability to operate or expand internationally.

Regulation

Overview

Our businesses are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision. The purpose of these regulations is primarily to protect our customers and the overall financial system and not necessarily our shareholders or debt holders. Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are regularly re-examined. Existing or future laws and regulations may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations or profitability, increase compliance costs, or increase potential regulatory exposure. In recent years we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, extensive changes in the laws and regulations, and regulatory frameworks applicable to our businesses in the U.S. and internationally. In particular, in October 2018 the Financial Stability Oversight Council (the “Council”) rescinded the Company’s designation as a non-bank financial company (a “Designated Financial Company”) subject to supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”) under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”) as discussed below. We cannot predict how current or future initiatives will further impact existing laws, regulations and regulatory frameworks.
In our international businesses, regulations may apply heightened requirements to non-domestic companies, which can reduce our flexibility as to intercompany transactions, investments and other aspects of business operations and adversely affect our liquidity and profitability. In some instances, regulators of a particular country may impose different, or more rigorous laws and requirements than in the U.S. or other countries to protect customers or their financial system from perceived systemic risk, including regulations governing privacy, consumer protection, employee protection, corporate governance and capital adequacy. In addition, certain of our international operations face political, legal, operational and other risks that we do not face in the U.S., including the risk of discriminatory regulation, labor issues in connection with workers’ associations and trade unions, nationalization or expropriation of assets, price controls and currency exchange controls or other restrictions that limit our ability to transfer funds from these operations out of the countries in which they operate or to convert local currencies we hold into U.S. dollars or other currencies. Some jurisdictions in which we operate joint ventures restrict our maximum percentage of ownership, which exposes us to additional operational, compliance, legal and joint venture partner risks and limits our array of potential remedies in the event of a breach by a partner.
The primary regulatory frameworks applicable to the Company are described further below under the following section headings:

• | Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act


◦ | Rescission of Designation


◦ | Initiatives Regarding Dodd-Frank and Financial Regulation


• | ERISA


• | Fiduciary Rules and other Standards of Care

• | Taxation


◦ | U.S. Taxation


◦ | International Taxation


• | International and Global Regulatory Initiatives

Several of our domestic and foreign regulators participate in an annual supervisory college facilitated by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance (“NJDOBI”). The purpose of the supervisory college is to promote ongoing supervisory coordination, facilitate the sharing of information among regulators and enhance each regulator’s understanding of the Company’s risk profile. The most recent supervisory college was held in October 2018.
19

 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act

Rescission of Designation
As a result of the Council’s rescission of the Company’s Designated Financial Company status, the Company is no longer subject to supervision and examination by the FRB or to the prudential standards applicable to Designated Financial Companies under Dodd-Frank. Accordingly, the Company will no longer incur FRB supervisory fees (which totaled approximately $24 million in each of the last three years) or certain consulting and other costs associated with FRB supervision.
The Council maintains the authority to designate entities, including the Company, for FRB supervision if it determines that either (i) material financial distress at the entity, or (ii) the nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, or mix of the entity’s activities, could pose a threat to domestic financial stability. The Company continues to believe it does not meet the standards for designation.
Initiatives Regarding Dodd-Frank and Financial Regulation
In November 2017, the U.S. Department of the Treasury released a report titled “Financial Stability Oversight Council Designations,” with recommendations on the Council’s standards and processes for the designation and continued designation of Designated Financial Companies. In addition, in October 2017, the U.S. Department of the Treasury released a report titled “A Financial System That Creates Economic Opportunities - Asset Management and Insurance” which recommended, among other things, that primary federal and state regulators should focus on potential systemic risks arising from products and activities, and on implementing regulations that strengthen the asset management and insurance industries as a whole, rather than focus on an entity-based regulatory regime. The report also affirmed the role of the U.S. state-based system of insurance regulation. From time to time Congress has also introduced legislation which if enacted, would amend certain provisions of Dodd-Frank, including by requiring the Council to prioritize the use of an activities-based approach to mitigate identified systemic risks.
We cannot predict whether the Treasury reports, new legislation or other initiatives aimed at revising Dodd-Frank and regulation of the financial system will ultimately form the basis for changes to laws or regulations impacting the Company.
ERISA

The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) is a comprehensive federal statute that applies to U.S. employee benefit plans sponsored by private employers and labor unions. Plans subject to ERISA include pension and profit sharing plans and welfare plans, including health, life and disability plans. ERISA provisions include reporting and disclosure rules, standards of conduct that apply to plan fiduciaries and prohibitions on transactions known as “prohibited transactions,” such as conflict-of-interest transactions and certain transactions between a benefit plan and a party in interest. ERISA also provides for civil and criminal penalties and enforcement. Our insurance, investment management and retirement businesses provide services to employee benefit plans subject to ERISA, including services where we may act as an ERISA fiduciary. In addition to ERISA regulation of businesses providing products and services to ERISA plans, we become subject to ERISA’s prohibited transaction rules for transactions with those plans, which may affect our ability to enter transactions, or the terms on which transactions may be entered, with those plans, even in businesses unrelated to those giving rise to party in interest status.
Fiduciary Rules and Other Standards of Care
The Company and our distributors are subject to rules regarding the standard of care applicable to sales of our products and the provision of advice to our customers. In recent years, many of these rules have been revised or reexamined, as described below. We cannot predict whether any proposed or new amendments to the existing regulatory framework will ultimately become applicable to our businesses. Any new standards issued by the U.S. Department of Labor (“DOL”), the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) or state regulators may affect our businesses, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 
DOL Fiduciary Rules
In June 2018 a Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals decision became effective that vacated rules issued by the DOL that redefined who would be considered a “fiduciary” for purposes of transactions with qualified plans, plan participants and Individual Retirement Accounts (“IRAs”), and generally provided that investment advice to a plan participant or IRA owner would be treated as a fiduciary activity. The rules adversely impacted sales in our annuities and retirement business and resulted in increased compliance costs prior to the rules being vacated. We cannot predict whether the DOL will issue any new fiduciary rules or what impact they would 
20

have on the Company. 
SEC Best Interest Regulation
In April 2018, the SEC proposed a package of rulemakings and interpretative guidance that would, among other things, require broker-dealers to act in the best interest of retail customers when recommending securities transactions or investment strategies to them. The proposals would also clarify the SEC’s views of the fiduciary duty that investment advisers owe to their clients. If enacted in their current form, we believe the primary impact of the proposals would be to our Individual Annuities, Retirement, PGIM and Individual Life segments and our Prudential Advisors distribution system, which we include in the results of our Individual Life segment.
U.S. State Standard of Care Regulation
The NAIC has formed an Annuity Suitability Working Group, which is developing proposed revisions to the model suitability rule applicable to the sale of annuities. Amendments to the model rule could ultimately form the basis of amendments to state insurance law suitability rules applicable to our business. In addition, certain state regulators and legislatures have adopted or are considering adopting best interest standards. For example, in July 2018, the New York State Department of Financial Services (“NY DFS”) issued an amendment to its suitability regulations which will impose a best-interest standard on the sale of annuity and life insurance products in New York. The amendments are scheduled to become effective for annuity products on August 1, 2019 and for life insurance products on February 1, 2020. In addition, in October 2018 the New Jersey Bureau of Securities issued a proposal that would impose a fiduciary standard on all New Jersey investment professionals.
Japan Standard of Care Regulation
Outside the U.S., in 2017 the Japanese Financial Services Agency (“FSA”) announced the “Principles of Fiduciary Duty,” a set of recommended general principles for businesses to adopt when performing client related financial services. The principles have been adopted by The Prudential Life Insurance Company Ltd. (“Prudential of Japan”), Gibraltar Life, and Prudential Gibraltar Financial Life Insurance Company, Ltd. (“PGFL”). The FSA encourages voluntary adoption of these fiduciary principles as a best practice, but adoption is not required by regulation. Companies’ policies regarding their fiduciary duties can be tailored based on their specific business, such as target clients and complexity of products. Once companies adopt the principles and establish a policy, they are required to implement measures to ensure their employees fulfill their fiduciary duties, and periodically assess the measures’ effectiveness. 
U.S. State Insurance Holding Company Regulation

We are subject to the insurance holding company laws in the states where our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, which currently include New Jersey, Arizona, Connecticut and Indiana, or are treated as commercially domiciled, such as New York. These laws generally require each insurance company directly or indirectly owned by the holding company to register with the insurance department in the insurance company’s state of domicile and to furnish annually financial and other information about the operations of companies within the holding company system, including an assessment of the group’s risk management and current and future solvency position. Generally, all transactions affecting the insurers in the holding company system must be fair and reasonable and, if material, require prior notice and approval or non-disapproval by the state’s insurance department.
Change of Control
Most states, including the states in which our U.S. insurance companies are domiciled, have insurance laws that require regulatory approval of a direct or indirect change of control of an insurer or an insurer’s holding company. Laws such as these that apply to us prevent any person from acquiring control of Prudential Financial or of our insurance subsidiaries unless that person has filed a statement with specified information with the insurance regulators and has obtained their prior approval. Under most states’ statutes, acquiring 10% or more of the voting stock of an insurance company or its parent company is presumptively considered a change of control, although such presumption may be rebutted. Accordingly, any person who acquires 10% or more of the voting securities of Prudential Financial without the prior approval of the insurance regulators of the states in which our U.S. insurance companies are domiciled will be in violation of these states’ laws and may be subject to injunctive action requiring the disposition or seizure of those securities by the relevant insurance regulator or prohibiting the voting of those securities and to other actions determined by the relevant insurance regulator. In addition, many state insurance laws require prior notification to state insurance departments of a change in control of a non-domiciliary insurance company doing business in that state.

Group-Wide Supervision

21

NJDOBI acts as the group-wide supervisor of Prudential Financial pursuant to New Jersey legislation that authorizes group-wide supervision of internationally active insurance groups (“IAIGs”). The law, among other provisions, authorizes NJDOBI to examine Prudential Financial and its subsidiaries, including by ascertaining the financial condition of the insurance companies for purposes of assessing enterprise risk. In accordance with this authority, NJDOBI receives information about the Company’s operations beyond those of its New Jersey domiciled insurance subsidiaries.

Additional areas of focus regarding group-wide supervision of insurance holding companies include the following:
•Group Capital Calculation. The NAIC has formed a working group to develop a U.S. group capital calculation using a risk-based capital (“RBC”) aggregation methodology. In constructing the calculation, the working group is considering group capital developments undertaken by the FRB and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (“IAIS”). The working group plans to develop a proposed calculation and begin field testing in 2019.
•Macroprudential Framework. The NAIC has established a new initiative to develop a macroprudential framework intended to: (1) improve state insurance regulators’ ability to monitor and respond to the impact of external financial and economic risks on insurers; (2) better monitor and respond to risk emanating from or amplified by insurers that might be transmitted externally; and (3) increase public awareness of NAIC/state monitoring capabilities regarding macroprudential trends. As part of this initiative, the areas identified by the NAIC for potential enhancement include liquidity reporting and stress testing, resolution and recovery, capital stress testing, and counterparty exposure and concentration. 
•Examination. State insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the books and records, financial reporting, policy filings and market conduct of insurance companies domiciled in their states, generally once every three to five years. Examinations are generally carried out in cooperation with the insurance departments of other states under guidelines promulgated by the NAIC. As group-wide supervisor, NJDOBI, along with our other insurance regulators, has expanded the periodic examinations to cover Prudential and all of its subsidiaries. In June 2018, NJDOBI, along with the insurance regulators of Arizona, Connecticut and Indiana, completed their first global consolidated group-wide examination of Prudential and its subsidiaries for the five-year period ended December 31, 2016 and had no reportable findings.
We cannot predict what, if any, additional requirements and compliance costs any new group-wide standards will impose on Prudential Financial.
U.S. Insurance Operations

State insurance laws regulate all aspects of our U.S. insurance businesses, and state insurance departments in the fifty states, the District of Columbia and various U.S. territories and possessions monitor our insurance operations. Prudential Insurance is domiciled in New Jersey and its principal insurance regulatory authority is the NJDOBI. Our other U.S. insurance companies are principally regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled. Generally, our insurance products must be approved by the insurance regulators in the state in which they are sold. Our insurance products are substantially affected by federal and state tax laws.
State Insurance Regulation

State insurance authorities have broad administrative powers with respect to all aspects of the insurance business including: (1) licensing to transact business; (2) licensing agents; (3) admittance of assets to statutory surplus; (4) regulating premium rates for certain insurance products; (5) approving policy forms; (6) regulating unfair trade and claims practices; (7) establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards; (8) fixing maximum interest rates on life insurance policy loans and minimum accumulation or surrender values; (9) regulating the type, amounts and valuations of investments permitted; (10) regulating reinsurance transactions, including the role of captive reinsurers; and (11) other matters.

State insurance laws and regulations require our U.S. insurance companies to file financial statements with state insurance departments everywhere they do business in accordance with accounting practices and procedures prescribed or permitted by these departments. The operations of our U.S. insurance companies and accounts are subject to examination by those departments at any time.

Financial Regulation

Dividend Payment Limitations. New Jersey insurance law and the insurance laws of the other states in which our insurance 
22

companies are domiciled regulate the amount of dividends that may be paid by Prudential Insurance and our other U.S. insurance companies. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Risk-Based Capital. We are subject to RBC requirements that are designed to enhance regulation of insurers’ solvency. The RBC calculation, which regulators use to assess the sufficiency of an insurer’s statutory capital, measures the risk characteristics of a company’s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items. In general, RBC is calculated by applying factors to various asset, premium, claim, expense and reserve items. Within a given risk category, these factors are higher for those items with greater underlying risk and lower for items with lower underlying risk. Insurers that have less statutory capital than required are considered to have inadequate capital and are subject to varying degrees of regulatory action depending upon the level of capital inadequacy.

Areas of the RBC framework that have been subject to reexamination or revision include the following:
•Tax Act Changes. In June 2018, the NAIC’s Capital Adequacy Task Force approved revisions to the RBC framework in respect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act of 2017”). The revisions apply to our domestic life insurance companies’ RBC ratios as of December 31, 2018. For a discussion of the impact of the Tax Act of 2017 and these changes on our RBC ratios, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Capital—Insurance Regulatory Capital.”
•Bond Factors. The NAIC’s Investment Risk-Based Capital Working Group is developing updates to the RBC factors for invested assets including expanding, for RBC purposes, the current NAIC designations from six to twenty. 
•Longevity/Mortality Risk. The NAIC’s Longevity Risk Subgroup of the Life Insurance and Annuities Committee and Financial Condition Committee is developing recommendations to recognize longevity risk in statutory reserves and/or risk-based capital related to annuities. The Company assumes this longevity risk primarily in its Retirement and Individual Annuities businesses. The NAIC is also developing updates to the existing mortality risk factors in RBC.
•Operational Risk. In 2018 the NAIC adopted operational risk charges that will be effective for year-end 2018 RBC formulas and is continuing to consider whether to add an explicit growth risk charge to the RBC formula. The operational risk charges are not expected to materially impact our 2018 RBC ratios given that we expect to hold statutory capital consistent with or in excess of the thresholds established through these new charges.
Due to the ongoing nature of the NAIC’s activities regarding RBC, we cannot determine the ultimate timing of the proposed changes or their impact on RBC or on our financial position.

Insurance Reserves and Regulatory Capital. State insurance laws require us to analyze the adequacy of our reserves annually. The respective appointed actuaries for each of our life insurance companies must each submit an opinion that our reserves, when considered in light of the assets we hold with respect to those reserves, make adequate provision for our contractual obligations and related expenses.

The reserving framework for certain of our products has undergone reexamination and revision in recent years, including in the following areas:
•Principle-Based Reserving for Life Insurance Products. In 2016, the NAIC adopted a principle-based reserving approach for life insurance products. Principle-based reserving replaces the reserving methods for life insurance products for which the current formulaic basis for reserves may not accurately reflect the risks or costs of the liability or obligations of the insurer. The principle-based reserving approach has a three-year phase-in period. At the Company's discretion, it may be applied to new individual life business beginning as early as January 1, 2017, but must be applied for all new individual life business issued January 1, 2020 and later. The Company may select different implementation dates for different products. Principle-based reserving will not affect reserves for policies in force prior to January 1, 2017. 
The Company has introduced updated versions of several products in its individual life product portfolio in conjunction with the requirement to adopt principle-based reserving by January 1, 2020. Notably, the Company adopted principle-based reserving for its guaranteed universal life products and introduced updated versions of these products in 2017. The guaranteed universal life updated products support the principle-based statutory reserve level without the need for financing through captive reinsurance under Actuarial Guideline No. 48 (“AG 48”) or its successor, the Credit for Reinsurance Model Law and the Term and Universal Life Insurance Reserving Financing 
23

Model Regulation. AG 48 prescribes an actuarial method to determine the portion of the assets held to support reserves for certain term and universal life policies that must be cash and rated securities, and the portion that may be financed or supported by other assets. The Company is continuing to assess the impact of principle-based reserving on projected statutory reserve levels and product pricing for its remaining portfolio of individual life product offerings, such as term and variable life insurance.
•Variable Annuities Framework for Change. In 2018, the NAIC adopted a framework for proposed revisions to the current Actuarial Guideline No. 43 (“AG 43”) and RBC “C-3 Phase II” system applicable to variable annuities reserve and capital requirements. Proposed changes include: (i) aligning economically-focused hedge assets with liability valuations; (ii) reforming standard scenarios for AG 43 and C3 Phase II; (iii) revising asset admissibility for derivatives and deferred tax assets; and (iv) standardizing capital market assumptions and aligning total asset requirements and reserves. The NAIC will seek to implement the revised framework in 2019 with a January 1, 2020 targeted effective date and an optional three-year phase-in. The Company does not expect material impacts to target capital levels from the revised framework. 
During 2016, we recaptured the risks related to our variable annuities living benefit riders and certain retirement products that were previously reinsured to our captive reinsurance company in a series of transactions we collectively refer to as the “Variable Annuities Recapture.” While we completed the Variable Annuities Recapture in advance of definitive guidance from the NAIC's Variable Annuity Issues Working Group, we believe the Variable Annuities Recapture is reasonably aligned with the key concept changes planned under the framework.
•New York Variable Annuity and Life Insurance Product Reserves. As a result of an agreement with the NY DFS regarding our reserving methodologies for certain variable annuity and life insurance products, certain of our New York licensed insurance subsidiaries hold additional statutory reserves on a New York basis, which reduces their New York statutory surplus. None of our U.S. operating insurance companies are domiciled in New York, and these changes do not impact statutory reserves reported in our insurance subsidiaries’ states of domicile, or any states other than New York, and therefore do not impact RBC ratios; however, the agreed reserve methodologies may require us to increase our additional New York statutory reserves in the future. If we were required to establish material additional reserves on a New York statutory accounting basis or post material amounts of additional collateral with respect to annuity or insurance products, our ability to deploy capital held within our U.S. domestic insurance subsidiaries for other purposes could be affected.
•Reinsurance. The NAIC’s Statutory Accounting Principles Working Group is reviewing the statutory accounting rules regarding reinsurance credit, including with respect to the risk transfer requirements for yearly renewable term reinsurance agreements. Certain changes currently under consideration could adversely impact statutory reserve credit for our yearly renewable term reinsurance related to our group life insurance business. 
The NAIC’s Life Actuarial Task Force is also evaluating changes to its Valuation Manual in respect of yearly renewable term reinsurance. Certain changes currently under consideration could adversely impact statutory reserve credit for yearly renewable term reinsurance related to our individual life insurance products being reserved using a principle-based approach.

•Surplus Notes. The NAIC’s Statutory Accounting Principles Working Group is evaluating changes to the accounting rules regarding surplus notes with linked assets. This change could result in the classification of the surplus notes as debt instead of surplus and require linked assets to be treated as non-admitted assets. These changes would materially adversely impact the statutory financial position of the Company’s captive reinsurance subsidiaries that use credit-linked note structures to finance Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX reserves.
Captive Reinsurance Companies. 
We have used captive reinsurance subsidiaries to finance the portion of the statutory reserves for term and universal life policies that we consider to be non-economic. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining additional financing as a result of market conditions, regulatory changes or otherwise, this could require us to increase prices, reduce our sales of certain life products, or modify certain products, any of which could adversely affect our competitiveness, capital and financial position and results of operations. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Capital—Financing Activities—Term and Universal Life Reserve Financing” for a discussion of our life product reserves and reserve financing. 
24

Market Conduct Regulation

State insurance laws and regulations include numerous provisions governing the marketplace activities of insurers, including provisions governing the form and content of disclosure to consumers, illustrations, advertising, sales practices and complaint handling. State regulatory authorities generally enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations.
Insurance Guaranty Association Assessments

Each state has insurance guaranty association laws under which insurers doing business in the state are members and may be assessed by state insurance guaranty associations for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. Typically, states assess each member insurer in an amount related to the member insurer’s proportionate share of the line of business written by all member insurers in the state. Many states offer a reimbursement of such assessments in the form of credits against future years’ premium taxes. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we paid $2.3 million, $12.6 million and $1.5 million, respectively, in assessments pursuant to state insurance guaranty association laws. The 2017 assessments reflected the Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company insolvency, which was liquidated on March 1, 2017. While we cannot predict the amount and timing of future assessments on our U.S. insurance companies under these laws, we have established estimated reserves totaling approximately $33.4 million as of December 31, 2018, for future assessments relating to insurance companies that are currently subject to insolvency proceedings including Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company, Executive Life of California and Lincoln Memorial Life Insurance Company.
In 2017, the NAIC approved amendments to the Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association Model Act to address issues relating to long-term care insurance-related insolvencies. The amendments will spread costs from future long-term care insurance-related insolvencies across the entire health and life insurance industry, resulting in increased assessments for life insurers. The amended model law will become applicable to us as it is adopted by each state. Prior insolvencies will not be included under these amendments. Given our current market share of the impacted lines of business, we expect our cost related to future insolvencies, net of premium tax credits available under current state laws, would be a small percentage of the gross industry liability.
U.S. Federal and State Securities Regulation Affecting Insurance Operations

Our variable life insurance, variable annuity and mutual fund products generally are “securities” within the meaning of federal securities laws and may be required to be registered under the federal securities laws and subject to regulation by the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”). Certain of our insurance subsidiaries are subject to SEC public reporting and disclosure requirements based on offerings of these products. Federal and some state securities regulation similar to that discussed below under “—Investment Products and Investment Management Operations” and “—Securities and Commodities Regulation” affect investment advice, sales and related activities with respect to these products.

Our mutual funds, and in certain states our variable life insurance and variable annuity products, are also “securities” within the meaning of state securities laws. As securities, these products are subject to filing and certain other requirements. Also, sales activities with respect to these products generally are subject to state securities regulation. Such regulation may affect investment advice, sales and related activities for these products.

Federal Insurance Office

Dodd-Frank established a Federal Insurance Office (“FIO”) within the Department of the Treasury headed by a director appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury. While the FIO does not have general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance, the FIO director performs various functions with respect to insurance, including serving as a non-voting member of the Council, monitoring the insurance sector and representing the U.S. on prudential aspects of international insurance matters, including at the IAIS. 
International Insurance Regulation

Our international insurance operations are principally supervised by regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they operate, including the Japanese Ministry of Finance and the Japanese FSA, the financial services regulator in Japan. In addition to Japan, we operate insurance companies in Argentina, Bermuda, Brazil, Italy, Korea, Mexico and Taiwan, and have insurance operations in China, India, Indonesia and Malaysia through joint ventures, and in Ghana through a strategic investment. The insurance regulatory bodies for these businesses typically oversee such issues as: (1) company licensing; (2) the licensing of insurance sales staff; (3) insurance product approvals; (4) sales practices; (5) claims payment practices; (6) permissible investments; (7) solvency and capital adequacy; and (8) insurance reserves, among other items. In some jurisdictions, for certain products, 
25

regulators will also mandate premium rates (or components of pricing) or minimum guaranteed interest rates. Periodic examinations of insurance company books and records, financial reporting requirements, market conduct examinations and policy filing requirements are among the techniques used by these regulators to supervise our non-U.S. insurance businesses. Finally, insurance regulatory authorities in the various jurisdictions in which our insurance companies are domiciled, including Japan, must approve any change of control of Prudential Financial or the insurance companies organized under their laws.

Solvency Regulation
In order to monitor insurers’ solvency, regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate outside the U.S. generally establish some form of minimum solvency requirements for insurance companies, similar in concept to the RBC ratios that are employed by U.S. insurance regulators. These solvency ratios are used by regulators to assess the sufficiency of an insurer’s capital and claims-paying ability and include the impact of transactions with affiliated entities. Certain jurisdictions require the disclosure of solvency ratios to the public. Insurers that have lower solvency ratios than the regulators require are considered to have inadequate capital and are subject to varying degrees of regulatory action depending upon the level of capital inadequacy.
Changes in solvency regulation from jurisdiction to jurisdiction may arise based on the regulatory standards developed by the Financial Stability Board (“FSB”), IAIS or authorities in the U.S. or the European Economic Area (“EEA”). FSB and IAIS developments are described below under “—International and Global Regulatory Initiatives.” 
 Japan Capital and Solvency Regulation. Our Japan insurance operations are subject to a consolidated basis capital standard known as the Solvency Margin Ratio framework (“SMR”). This standard prescribes the manner in which an insurance company’s capital is calculated and is meant to respond to changes in financial markets, improve risk management practices of insurers and consider risks associated with the insurer’s subsidiaries. In 2016 and 2018, the FSA conducted a field test of a potential market based alternative to the SMR framework that closely aligned with components of the IAIS’s Risk-based Global Insurance Capital Standard (“ICS”), which is described below under “—Other International and Global Regulatory Initiatives.” The FSA may continue to explore potential alternatives or revisions to the existing SMR framework. We cannot predict whether changes to the SMR will be adopted, or if they will result in additional capital requirements and compliance costs.
Korea Accounting Standards, Capital and Solvency Regulation. In 2017, the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) released a new International Financial Reporting Standard (“IFRS”) for accounting for insurance contracts, which will apply to our operations in Korea and certain other jurisdictions. The new IFRS was initially scheduled to go into effect in 2021; however, in 2018 the IASB deferred the effective date to 2022. Korea’s Financial Supervisory Service and Financial Services Commission announced plans to enhance the liability adequacy test in June 2017 as part of its adoption effort. The enhancements require life insurers to set aside additional policy reserves in phases to support the transition to IFRS, which is expected to lead to an increase in the level of reserves insurers must hold. In Japan, changes in IFRS do not currently impact our operations as they are not required to report under IFRS.
Our Korea insurance operation is subject to RBC requirements that are based in part on financial statements prepared in accordance with current accounting requirements. In 2017 and 2018, the Financial Supervisory Service (“FSS”) of Korea conducted a field test of a potential market based alternative to the RBC framework that closely aligned with components of the IAIS’ ICS. The FSS will continue to explore potential alternatives or revisions to the existing RBC framework through further quantitative impact studies with the intention of implementing changes in parallel with its implementation of the new IFRS standards for accounting for insurance contracts. We cannot predict whether changes to the RBC framework will ultimately be adopted, or if they will result in additional capital requirements and compliance costs.
Dividend Payment Limitations
The insurance regulatory bodies in some of the countries where our international insurance businesses are located regulate the amount of dividends that they can pay to shareholders. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the ability of our international subsidiaries to pay dividends to Prudential Financial.
Insurance Guaranty Fund Assessments
Certain of our international insurance operations, including those in Japan, may be subject to assessments, generally based on their proportionate share of business written in the relevant jurisdiction, for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. As we cannot predict the timing of future assessments, they may materially affect the results of operations of our international insurance operations in particular quarterly or annual periods. Under the Japanese insurance guaranty law, all licensed life insurers in Japan are required to be members of and are assessed, on a pre-funded basis, by the Japan Policyholders Protection Corporation (“PPC”). These assessments generate a collective fund which is used to satisfy certain 
26

obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. The PPC assesses each member in an amount related to its proportionate share of new business written by all member insurers. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we paid approximately $22 million, $21 million and $22 million, respectively, based on fixed currency exchange rates, in assessments pursuant to Japanese insurance guaranty association laws.
U.S. Investment and Retirement Products and Investment Management Operations

Our investment products and services are subject to federal and state securities, fiduciary, including ERISA, and other laws and regulations. The SEC, FINRA, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”), state securities commissions, state banking and insurance departments and the DOL are the principal U.S. regulators that regulate our investment management operations. In some cases our domestic U.S. investment operations are also subject to non-U.S. securities laws and regulations.

Some of the separate account, mutual fund and other pooled investment products offered by our businesses, in addition to being registered under the Securities Act, are registered as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the shares of certain of these entities are qualified for sale in some states and the District of Columbia. Separate account investment products are also subject to state insurance regulation as described above. We also have several subsidiaries that are registered as broker-dealers under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), as amended, and are subject to federal and state regulation. In addition, we have subsidiaries that are investment advisers registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. Our third-party advisors and licensed sales professionals within Prudential Advisors and other employees, insofar as they sell products that are securities, are subject to the Exchange Act and to examination requirements and regulation by the SEC, FINRA and state securities commissioners. Regulation and examination requirements also extend to various Prudential entities that employ or control those individuals. 

Congress from time to time considers pension reform legislation that could decrease or increase the attractiveness of certain of our retirement products and services to retirement plan sponsors and administrators, or have an unfavorable or favorable effect on our ability to earn revenues from these products and services. Over time, these changes could hinder our sales of defined benefit pension products and services and cause sponsors to discontinue existing plans for which we provide investment management, administrative, or other services, but could increase the attractiveness of certain products we offer in connection with pension plans.
Congress is considering legislation that would improve and enhance the U.S.’s existing employer-provided retirement system.  Among other things, certain policy measures, if enacted, would help promote plan coverage by expanding access to and use of Multiple Employer Plans; facilitate access to lifetime income disclosures for plan participants to better understand how their retirement savings translate into monthly lifetime income in retirement; improve upon the current annuity selection safe harbor; and provide lifetime income portability.
Finally, Federal and state banking laws also generally require regulatory approval for a change in control of Prudential Financial, Prudential Bank & Trust, FSB (“PB&T”) or Prudential Trust Company. The U.S. federal securities laws could also require reapproval or consent by customers of our investment advisory contracts upon a change of control, including for mutual funds included in annuity products.

U.S. Securities and Commodity Operations

We have subsidiaries that are broker-dealers, investment advisers, commodity pool operators or commodity trading advisers. The SEC, the CFTC, state securities authorities, FINRA, the National Futures Association (“NFA”), the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, and similar authorities are the principal regulators of these subsidiaries.

Our broker-dealer and commodities affiliates are members of, and are subject to regulation by, “self-regulatory organizations,” including FINRA and the NFA. Self-regulatory organizations conduct examinations of, and have adopted rules governing, their members. In addition, state securities and certain other regulators have regulatory and oversight authority over our registered broker-dealers. Broker-dealers and their sales forces in the U.S. and in certain other jurisdictions are subject to regulations that cover many aspects of the securities business, including sales methods and trading practices. The regulations cover the suitability of investments for individual customers, use and safekeeping of customers’ funds and securities, capital adequacy, recordkeeping, financial reporting and the conduct of directors, officers and employees. The SEC, CFTC and other governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory agencies, have the power to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fine, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or suspension, termination or limitation of the activities of a broker-dealer, an investment adviser or commodities firm or its employees. Our U.S. registered broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to federal net capital requirements that may limit the ability of these subsidiaries to pay dividends to Prudential Financial.

International Investment and Retirement Products and Investment Management Operations
Our non-insurance international operations are supervised primarily by regulatory authorities in the countries in which they operate. We operate investment-related businesses in, among other jurisdictions, Japan, Taiwan, the U.K., Ireland, Hong Kong, Mexico, Germany, Luxembourg, China and Singapore, and participate in investment-related joint ventures in India, Italy and China and a retirement related joint venture in Chile. These businesses may provide products such as investment management products and services, mutual funds, separately managed accounts and retirement products. The regulatory authorities for these businesses typically oversee such issues as: (1) company licensing; (2) the licensing of investment product sales staff; (3) sales practices; (4) solvency and capital adequacy; (5) mutual fund product approvals and related disclosures; and (6) securities, commodities and related laws, among other items. In some cases, our international investment operations are also subject to U.S. securities laws and regulations.

In June 2016, the U.K. approved a non-binding referendum to exit the European Union. The formal process for the U.K. to exit from the European Union remains subject to ongoing negotiation between the U.K. and the European Union on the timing and terms of the exit. The outcome of the negotiations will determine the ultimate impact of the exit on our operations and investments in those jurisdictions and may lead to volatility in currency exchange rates and asset prices, as well as changes in regulation. In the event the exit results in future restrictions on cross-border trade in financial services and products between the U.K. and the European Union, PGIM may incur additional expenses and operational burdens in order to ensure compliance with such restrictions.  PGIM has implemented a number of steps to seek to ensure it is prepared, to the extent possible, for various outcomes, including forming new legal entities and applying for licenses and permissions in certain European Union countries, and engaging in client communications.
Derivatives Regulation

Prudential Financial and our subsidiaries use derivatives for various purposes, including hedging interest rate, foreign currency and equity market exposures. Dodd-Frank established a framework for regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives markets. This framework sets out requirements regarding the clearing and reporting of derivatives transactions, as well as collateral posting requirements for uncleared swaps. Affiliated swaps entered into between our subsidiaries are generally exempt from most of these requirements. 

We continue to monitor the potential hedging cost impacts of new initial margin requirements that we will be required to comply with in 2020, and increased capital requirements for derivatives transactions that may be imposed on banks that are our counterparties. Additionally, the increased need to post cash collateral in connection with mandatorily cleared swaps may also require the liquidation of higher yielding assets for low yielding cash, resulting in a negative impact on investment income.
Privacy and Cybersecurity Regulation

We are subject to laws, regulations and directives that require financial institutions and other businesses to protect the security and confidentiality of personal information, including health-related and customer information, and to notify their customers and other individuals of their policies and practices relating to the collection and disclosure of health-related and customer information. In addition, we must comply with international privacy laws, regulations, and directives concerning the cross border transfer or use of employee and customer personal information. These laws, regulations and directives also:

• | provide additional protections regarding the use and disclosure of certain information such as social security numbers;


• | require notice to affected individuals, regulators and others if there is a breach of the security of certain personal information;


• | require financial institutions and creditors to implement effective programs to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft;


• | regulate the process by which financial institutions make telemarketing calls and send e-mail or fax messages to consumers and customers; and


• | prescribe the permissible uses of certain personal information, including customer information and consumer report information.

Financial regulators in the U.S. and international jurisdictions in which we operate continue to focus on data privacy and cybersecurity, including in proposed rulemaking, and have communicated heightened expectations and have increased emphasis in this area in their examinations of regulated entities. For example, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective in May 2018, confers additional privacy rights on individuals in the European Union and establishes penalties for violations. In addition, in the United States the Federal government has proposed a number of laws similar to the GDPR and California has enacted broad legislation effective in 2020 which is similar in many ways to the GDPR. 
28

Internationally, a number of countries such as Brazil and Argentina have enacted or are considering enacting GDPR-like regulations.

In October 2017, the NAIC adopted the Insurance Data Security Model Law. The model law requires that insurance companies establish a cybersecurity program and includes specific technical safeguards as well as requirements regarding governance, incident planning, data management, system testing, vendor oversight and regulator notification. New York implemented a similar law in March 2017 and other states have either implemented the Model Law or are anticipated to implement it in the near future.

The Company is monitoring regulatory guidance and rulemaking in this area, and may be subject to increased compliance costs and regulatory requirements. In order to respond to the threat of security breaches and cyber-attacks, we have developed a program overseen by the Chief Information Security Officer and the Information Security Office that is designed to protect and preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and continued availability of all information owned by, or in the care of the Company. As part of this program, we also maintain an incident response plan. The program provides for the coordination of various corporate functions and governance groups, and serves as a framework for the execution of responsibilities across businesses and operational roles. The program establishes security standards for our technological resources, and includes training for employees, contractors and third parties. As part of the program, we conduct periodic exercises and a response readiness assessment with outside advisors to gain a third-party independent assessment of our technical program and our internal response preparedness. We regularly engage with the outside security community and monitor cyber threat information.

Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Bribery Laws

Our businesses are subject to various anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and regulations that seek to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering. In addition, under current U.S. law and regulations we may be prohibited from dealing with certain individuals or entities in certain circumstances and we may be required to monitor customer activities, which may affect our ability to attract and retain customers. We are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to corrupt and illegal payments to government officials and others, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K.’s Anti-Bribery Law. The obligation of financial institutions, including the Company, to identify their clients, to monitor for and report suspicious transactions, to monitor dealings with government officials, to respond to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies, and to share information with other financial institutions, has required the implementation and maintenance of internal practices, procedures and controls. 
Environmental Laws and Regulations

Federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations apply to our ownership and operation of real property. Inherent in owning and operating real property are the risks of hidden environmental liabilities and the costs of any required clean-up. Although unexpected environmental liabilities can always arise, we seek to minimize this risk by undertaking environmental assessments, among other measures prior to taking title to real estate.
Unclaimed Property Laws

We are subject to the laws and regulations of states and other jurisdictions concerning the identification, reporting and escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned funds, and we are subject to audit and examination for compliance with these requirements. For additional discussion of these matters, see Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Taxation
U.S. Taxation

The Company and certain domestic subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return that includes both life insurance companies and non-life insurance companies. Certain other domestic subsidiaries file separate tax returns. The principal differences between the Company’s actual income tax expense and the applicable statutory federal income tax rate are generally deductions for non-taxable investment income, including the Dividends Received Deduction (“DRD”), foreign taxes applied at a different tax rate than the U.S. rate and certain tax credits. For tax years prior to 2018, the applicable statutory federal tax rate was 35%. For tax years starting in 2018, the applicable statutory federal income tax rate is 21%. In addition, as discussed further below, the tax attributes of our products may impact both the Company’s and our customers’ tax positions. See “Income Taxes” in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company’s tax position. As discussed further below, new tax legislation and other potential changes to the tax law may impact the Company’s tax position and the attractiveness of our products.
29

The Tax Act of 2017 was enacted into law on December 22, 2017 and was generally effective starting in 2018. The Tax Act of 2017 changes the taxation of businesses and individuals by lowering tax rates and broadening the tax base through the acceleration of taxable income and the deferral or elimination of certain deductions, as well as changing the system of taxation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The most significant changes for the Company are: (1) the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%; (2) revised methodologies for determining deductions for tax reserves and the DRD; (3) an increased capitalization and amortization period for acquisition costs related to certain products; and (4) the change from a worldwide deferred taxation system to a modified territorial system of taxation on applicable earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which includes (a) a new tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries (the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) provision ) and (b) a new alternative tax with respect to payments to non-U.S. affiliates that are at least 25% owned (the Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax (“BEAT”)). The lower corporate tax rate reduced the Company’s domestic statutory capital and risk-based capital. For additional details, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Capital—Insurance Regulatory Capital.” 
The GILTI provision applies a minimum U.S. tax to earnings of foreign subsidiaries in excess of a 10% deemed return on tangible assets of consolidated foreign subsidiaries by imposing the U.S. tax rate to 50% of earnings of such foreign affiliates and provides for a partial foreign tax credit for foreign income taxes. The amount of tax in any period on GILTI can depend on annual differences between U.S. taxable income recognition rules and taxable income recognition rules in the country of operations and the overall taxable income of U.S. operations, as well as U.S. expense allocation rules which limit the amount of foreign tax credits that can be applied to reduce the U.S. tax on the GILTI. Under certain circumstance the taxable income of U.S. operations may cause more than 50% of earnings of foreign affiliates to be subject to the GILTI provision. In years that the U.S. consolidated PFI group incurs a net operating loss or has a loss from domestic businesses, the GILTI provision would operate to cause a loss of U.S. tax benefits for some or all of those losses, effectively increasing the tax on foreign earnings.
The BEAT provision could, under certain conditions, increase our tax expense. The BEAT is an alternative tax implicated if tax deductible payments from U.S. companies to foreign affiliates that are at least 25% owned exceed 3% of total U.S. tax deductions. If implicated, the BEAT taxes modified taxable income at a rate of 5% in 2018, increasing to 10% in 2019 and 12.5% in 2026 and is due if the calculated BEAT tax amount that is determined without the benefit of foreign and certain other tax credits is greater than the regular corporate tax in any given year. In general, modified taxable income is calculated by adding back to a taxpayer’s regular taxable income the amount of certain “base erosion tax benefits” with respect to payments to foreign affiliates, as well as the “base erosion percentage” of any net operating loss deductions. It is possible that benefit and claim payments made by our U.S. insurance business to our foreign affiliates on reinsurance assumed by the U.S. affiliates could be considered base erosion payments and, in the future, cause the U.S. consolidated PFI group to be subject to the BEAT. 
During 2018 the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) promulgated Proposed Regulations on a number of provisions within or impacted by the Tax Act of 2017 including GILTI, foreign tax credits, net interest deductibility and the BEAT. The Treasury and IRS have requested comments on the Proposed Regulations. Our analysis of these Proposed Regulations is on-going and further guidance may be needed from the Treasury Department and the IRS to fully understand and implement several provisions. Other life insurance and financial services companies may benefit more or less from these tax law changes, which could impact the Company’s overall competitive position. Notwithstanding the enactment of the Tax Act of 2017, the President, Congress, as well as state and local governments, may continue to consider from time to time legislation that could increase the amount of corporate taxes we pay, thereby reducing earnings. 
U.S. federal tax law generally permits tax deferral on the inside build-up of investment value of certain retirement savings, annuities and life insurance products until there is a contract distribution and, in general, excludes from taxation the death benefit paid under a life insurance contract. The Tax Act of 2017 did not change these rules, though it is possible that some individuals with overall lower effective tax rates could be less attracted to the tax deferral aspect of the Company’s products. The general reduction in individual tax rates and elimination of certain individual deductions may also impact the Company depending on whether current and potential customers have more or less after-tax income to save for retirement and manage their mortality and longevity risk through the purchase of the Company’s products. Congress from time to time may enact other changes to the tax law that could make our products less attractive to consumers, including legislation that would modify the tax favored treatment of retirement savings, life insurance and annuities products.
The products we sell have different tax characteristics and, in some cases, generate tax deductions and credits for the Company. Changes in either the U.S. or foreign tax laws may negatively impact the deductions and credits available to the Company, including the ability of the Company to claim foreign tax credits with respect to taxes withheld on our investments supporting separate account products. These changes would increase the Company’s actual tax expense and reduce its consolidated net income.
The profitability of certain products is significantly dependent on these characteristics and our ability to continue to generate taxable income, which is taken into consideration when pricing products and is a component of our capital management strategies. 
30

Accordingly, changes in tax law, our ability to generate taxable income, or other factors impacting the availability or value of the tax characteristics generated by our products, could impact product pricing and returns or require us to reduce our sales of these products or implement other actions that could be disruptive to our businesses.
International Taxation 
Our international businesses are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the countries in which they are organized and in which they operate. Foreign governments from time to time consider legislation that could impact the amount of taxes that we pay or impact the sales of our products. For example, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development continues to study model global base erosion tax options that may be considered and adopted by foreign governments. Such changes could negatively impact sales of our products or reduce our profits.
On December 19, 2017, South Korea enacted a 2018 tax reform bill that adds a new 25% corporate income tax bracket for taxable income in excess of ₩300 billion for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. Taxable income in excess of ₩20 billion but less than ₩300 billion continues to be subject to a 22% corporate income tax. In addition, corporations continue to be subject to a local income surtax of 10% of the computed corporate income tax (e.g., 2.5% for the tax base in excess of ₩300 billion, 2.2% for the tax base between ₩20 billion and ₩300 billion). After taking into account this 10% local income tax surcharge on corporate tax, the 2018 tax reform bill increased the top corporate income tax rate in South Korea from 24.2% to 27.5%.
Prior to 2017, the Japan national corporate tax rate was reduced from 23.9% for tax years beginning on or after April 1, 2015, to 23.4% for tax years beginning on or after April 1, 2016, and to 23.2% for tax years beginning on or after April 1, 2018. In addition, there are local income taxes that are applied to our income earned in Japan. The Japanese consumption tax rate is currently 8% and is scheduled to increase to 10% on October 1, 2019. Insurance commissions paid to our Life Planners and Life Consultants are subject to consumption tax for individuals exceeding certain earnings thresholds; however, the tax is not charged on employee compensation (other than commissions) or insurance premiums.
International and Global Regulatory Initiatives

In addition to the adoption of Dodd-Frank in the United States, lawmakers around the world are actively exploring steps to avoid future financial crises. In many respects, this work is being led by the FSB, which consists of representatives of national financial authorities of the G20 nations. The G20, the FSB and related bodies have developed proposals to address such issues as financial group supervision, capital and solvency standards, systemic economic risk, corporate governance including executive compensation, and a host of related issues.

In July 2013, we along with eight other global insurers, were designated by the FSB as a global systemically important insurer (“G-SII”) through a quantitative methodology developed and implemented by the IAIS. Similar assessments were performed and subsequent G-SII designation lists were issued annually through November 2016. We remained designated as a G-SII throughout this period. In November 2017, the FSB announced that the list of G-SIIs identified in 2016 would stand until November 2018, at which point it would assess the progress made by the IAIS’ on the development of an Activities-Based Approach (“ABA”) to assessing and managing potential systemic risk in the insurance sector. Over the course of 2018, the IAIS’ work to develop an ABA evolved into the development of a Holistic Framework for Systemic Risk in the Insurance Sector (“Holistic Framework”). Key elements of the Holistic Framework include enhancements to IAIS policy measures pertaining to macroprudential surveillance, enterprise risk management, liquidity management, crisis management and recovery planning as well as the continuation of annual data collection and monitoring by the IAIS. The IAIS will finalize the Holistic Framework in 2019 for implementation in 2020. In November 2018, the FSB announced that it would not engage in an identification of G-SIIs based on progress made on the development of the Holistic Framework and that it will assess an IAIS recommendation to suspend G-SII identification from 2020 in November 2019. The FSB further announced that it will review the need to either discontinue or re-establish the annual identification of G-SIIs in November 2022. 
In addition to its work on assessing and managing potential systemic risk, the IAIS is developing the Common Framework for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups (“ComFrame”). Through ComFrame, the IAIS seeks to promote effective and globally consistent supervision of the insurance industry through uniform standards for insurer corporate governance, enterprise risk management and other control functions, group-wide supervision and group capital adequacy. The non-capital related components of ComFrame are being developed iteratively through a series of public consultations and are scheduled to be adopted by the IAIS in November 2019. The ICS, which is the capital adequacy component of ComFrame, is also being developed iteratively through both a series of public consultations and voluntary field tests. In November 2017, the IAIS announced an agreement among its members on the development and implementation of the ICS. Terms of the agreement include: adoption of the ICS by the IAIS in November 2019; a five-year monitoring phase beginning in 2020 during which IAIGs are to report ICS results to their group supervisory authorities; and implementation of the ICS at the jurisdictional level in 2025.
31

As a standard setting body, the IAIS does not have direct authority to require insurance companies to comply with the policy measures it develops, including the ICS and proposed policy measures within the Holistic Framework. However, if the policy measures were adopted by either our group supervisor or supervisors of our international operations or companies, we could become subject to these standards. Adoption of IAIS policy measures could impact the manner in which we deploy our capital, structure and manage our businesses, and otherwise operate both within the U.S. and abroad. The possibility of inconsistent and conflicting regulation of Prudential at the group level and the subsidiary level also exists as law makers and regulators in multiple jurisdictions simultaneously pursue these initiatives.

Employees

As of December 31, 2018, we had 50,492 employees and sales associates, including 29,506 located outside of the United States. We believe our relations with our employees and sales associates are satisfactory.
