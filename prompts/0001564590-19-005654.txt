ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
---------+---------

 Throughout this document, BGC Partners, Inc. is referred to as “BGC” and, together with its subsidiaries, as the “Company,” “BGC Partners,” “we,” “us,” or “our.” 
 Our Businesses
 We are a leading global brokerage and financial technology company servicing the global financial markets through our Financial Services businesses. Through brands including BGC®, GFI®, Sunrise Brokers™, Besso®, Ed. ®, Poten & Partners™ and R.P. Martin™, among others, we specialize in the brokerage of a broad range of products, including fixed income (rates and credit), foreign exchange, equities, energy and commodities, insurance, and futures. We also provide a wide range of services, including trade execution, broker-dealer services, clearing, trade compression, post-trade, information, and other back-office services to a broad range of financial and non-financial institutions. Our integrated platforms are designed to provide flexibility to customers with regard to price discovery, execution and processing of transactions, and enable them to use voice, hybrid, or in many markets, fully electronic brokerage services in connection with transactions executed either over-the-counter (“OTC”) or through an exchange. Through our electronic brands including Fenics®, BGC Trader™, CreditMatch®, Fenics Market Data™, BGC Market Data™, kACE2®, EMBonds®, Capitalab®, Swaptioniser®, CBID® and Lucera®, we offer fully electronic brokerage, financial technology solutions, market data, post-trade services and analytics related to financial instruments and markets.
 Until November 30, 2018 (the “Distribution Date”), we operated in two segments, Financial Services and Real Estate Services. For purposes of this 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Financial Services business is described below and our Real Estate Services business is described at the end of this Item 1 in a section entitled “Newmark Real Estate Services Business (Discontinued Operations).” 
 On the Distribution Date, we completed our previously announced pro-rata distribution (the “Spin-Off”) to our stockholders of all of the shares of common stock of our publicly traded subsidiary, Newmark Group, Inc. (“Newmark”), which operated our Real Estate Services businesses, owned by us as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Spin-Off.  Following the Spin-Off, we ceased to be Newmark’s controlling stockholder, and we and our subsidiaries no longer held any shares of Newmark’s common stock or other equity interests in Newmark or its subsidiaries. Following the Spin-Off, we have been operating our business solely in one segment.
 BGC, BGC Partners, BGC Trader, GFI, CreditMatch, Fenics, Fenics.com, Sunrise Brokers, Besso, Ed., Poten & Partners, R. P. Martin, kACE2, EMBonds, Capitalab, Swaptioniser, CBID and Lucera are trademarks/service marks, and/or registered trademarks/service marks of BGC Partners, Inc. and/or its affiliates.
 Our customers include many of the world’s largest banks, broker-dealers, investment banks, trading firms, hedge funds, governments, corporations, investment firms, and prior to the Spin-Off, property owners and real estate developers. BGC Partners has dozens of offices globally in major markets including New York and London, as well as in Beijing, Bogotá, Buenos Aires, Chicago, Copenhagen, Dubai, Dublin, Geneva, Hong Kong, Istanbul, Johannesburg, Madrid, Mexico City, Moscow, Nyon, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Santiago, São Paulo, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore, Sydney, Tel Aviv, Tokyo and Toronto. Prior to the Spin-Off on November 30, 2018, we had offices in Atlanta, Boston, Charlotte, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Santa Clara, and Washington, D.C.
 As of December 31, 2018, we had over 2,600 brokers, salespeople, managers and other front-office personnel across our businesses.
 Our History 
 Our Financial Services business originates from one of the oldest and most established inter-dealer or wholesale brokerage franchises in the financial intermediary industry. Cantor started our wholesale intermediary brokerage operations in 1972. In 1996, Cantor launched its eSpeed system, which revolutionized the way government bonds are traded in the inter-dealer market by providing a fully electronic trading marketplace. eSpeed, Inc. (“eSpeed”) completed an initial public offering in 1999 and began trading on NASDAQ, yet it remained one of Cantor’s controlled subsidiaries. Following eSpeed’s initial public offering, Cantor continued to operate its inter-dealer voice/hybrid brokerage business separately from eSpeed. In August 2004, Cantor announced the reorganization and separation of its inter-dealer voice/hybrid brokerage business into a subsidiary called “BGC,” in honor of B. Gerald Cantor, the pioneer in screen brokerage services and fixed income market data products. In April 2008, BGC and certain other Cantor assets merged with and into eSpeed, and the combined company began operating under the name “BGC Partners, Inc.” In June 2013, BGC sold certain assets relating to its U.S. Treasury benchmark business and the name “eSpeed” to Nasdaq, Inc. (“Nasdaq,” formerly known as “NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.”) (see “Nasdaq Transaction and Nasdaq Monetization”).

Prior to the events of September 11, 2001, our financial brokerage business was widely recognized as one of the leading full-service wholesale financial brokers in the world, with a rich history of developing innovative technological and financial solutions. After September 11, 2001 and the loss of the majority of our U.S.-based employees, our voice financial brokerage business operated primarily in Europe. 
 Since the formation of BGC in 2004, we have substantially rebuilt our U.S. presence and have continued to expand our global footprint through the acquisition and integration of established brokerage companies and the hiring of experienced brokers. Through these actions, we have been able to expand our presence in key markets and position our Financial Services business for sustained growth. Since 2015, our Financial Services acquisitions have included those of GFI Group, Inc. (“GFI”), Sunrise Brokers Group, Poten & Partners Group, Inc., Ed Broking Group Limited, Perimeter Markets Inc, Lucera, Micromega Securities Proprietary Limited, and Besso Insurance Group Limited.
 Newmark was founded in 1929 with an emphasis on New York-based investor and owner services such as tenant and agency leasing. We acquired Newmark & Company Real Estate, Inc. in 2011, and since the acquisition, Newmark has embarked on a rapid expansion throughout North America across all critical business lines in the real estate services and product sectors. 
 Newmark IPO, Separation Transaction and Spin-Off.
 
On December 13, 2017, prior to the Newmark IPO (defined below), pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement (defined below), we transferred substantially all of the assets and labilities relating to our Real Estate Services business to Newmark. In connection with the Separation (defined below), Newmark assumed certain indebtedness and made a proportional distribution of interests in Newmark Holdings, L.P. (“Newmark Holdings”) to holders of interests in BGC Holdings. 
 
In December 2017, Newmark completed its initial public offering (the “Newmark IPO”) of an aggregate of 23 million shares of its Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Class A common stock”). Prior to the Newmark IPO, Newmark was our wholly owned subsidiary. 
 
On November 30, 2018, we completed our distribution of all of the shares of Class A and Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Class B common stock”) of Newmark held by us to our stockholders as of the close of business on November 23, 2018 through a special pro-rata stock dividend pursuant to which shares of Newmark’s Class A common stock held by BGC were distributed to holders of the Class A common stock of BGC and shares of Newmark’s Class B common stock held by BGC were distributed to holders of the Class B common stock of BGC (which holders of Class B common stock of BGC were Cantor and another entity controlled by our CEO, Howard W. Lutnick). Following the Spin-Off, BGC no longer holds any shares of Newmark. 
 
For more information about these transactions, see Note 1—“Organization and Basis of Presentation” to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Overview and Business Environment – Newmark IPO, Separation Transaction and Spin-Off” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Overview and Business Environment.”

GFI Transaction
 In early 2016, we completed our merger with GFI and now own 100% of GFI’s outstanding shares following a tender offer in 2015.  GFI is a leading intermediary and provider of trading technologies and support services to the global OTC and listed markets. GFI serves institutional clients in operating electronic and hybrid markets for cash and derivative products across multiple asset classes. 
 
Overview of Our Products and Services 
 Financial Services (including Fenics) 
 Financial Brokerage 
 We are focused on serving four principal financial brokerage markets: 
  
• | traditional, liquid brokerage markets, such as government bonds, over the counter (OTC) European and U.S. interest rate, foreign exchange, and energy derivatives, as well as listed futures;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | less liquid markets, such as emerging market bonds and single name credit derivatives;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | targeted local markets throughout the world; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | wholesale insurance brokerage.
--+-------------------------------

 We provide electronic marketplaces in multiple financial markets through numerous products and services, including Fenics, BGC Trader, and several multi-asset hybrid offerings for voice and electronic execution, including BGC’s Volume Match and GFI’s CreditMatch. These electronic marketplaces include government bond markets, interest rate derivatives, spot foreign exchange, foreign exchange derivatives, corporate bonds, and credit derivatives. We believe that we offer a comprehensive application providing volume, access, speed of execution and ease of use. Our trading platform establishes a direct link between our brokers and customers and occupies valuable real estate on traders’ desktops, which is difficult to replicate. We believe that we can leverage our platform to offer fully electronic trading as additional products transition from voice and hybrid trading to fully electronic execution. 
 For the purposes of this document and subsequent SEC filings, all of our fully electronic businesses are referred to as “Fenics.”  These offerings include fully electronic brokerage products, as well as offerings in market data, software solutions, and post-trade services across both BGC and GFI. We have leveraged our hybrid platform to provide real-time product and pricing information through applications such as BGC Trader. We also provide straight-through processing to our customers for an increasing number of products. Our end-to-end solution includes real-time and auction-based transaction processing, credit and risk management tools and back-end processing and billing systems. Customers can access our trading application through our privately managed global high speed data network, over the Internet, or through third-party communication networks.

Certain categories of trades settle for clearing purposes with CF&Co, one of our affiliates. CF&Co is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) and the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”), a subsidiary of the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation. In addition, certain affiliated entities are subject to regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”), including CF&Co and BGC Financial, L.P. (“BGC Financial” or “BGCF”). We, CF&Co, BGC Financial and other affiliates act in a matched principal or principal capacity in markets by posting and/or acting upon quotes for our account. Such activity is intended, among other things, to assist us, CF&Co and other affiliates in managing proprietary positions (including, but not limited to, those established as a result of combination trades and errors), facilitating transactions, framing markets, adding liquidity, increasing commissions and attracting order flow. Similarly, when framing a market in a “name passing” marketplace, we and our affiliates may post quotations that we believe reflect contemporaneous and/or anticipated potential market interest in an effort to facilitate liquidity for market participants on our respective platforms. We and our affiliates use commercially reasonable efforts to find a counterparty for any resulting transactions, at the customary minimum size level for that market.

 Software Solutions and Post-Trade Services 
 Through our Software Solutions business, we provide customized screen-based market solutions to both related and unrelated parties. Our clients are able to develop a marketplace, trade with their customers and access our network and our intellectual property. We can add advanced functionality to enable our customers to distribute branded products to their customers through online offerings and auctions, including private and reverse auctions, via our trading platform and global network. 
 We offer a derivative price discovery, pricing analysis, risk management and trading software used by nearly 2,000 users globally at mid-tier banks, financial institutions and corporate clients. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we released our Fenics Trading Solutions™ platform, designed to enable our clients to better manage their trade flows and facilitate liquidity management, price making and distribution. During the first half of 2018, we fully integrated Fenics software and the recently purchased Kalahari software to form kACE, our new analytics brand. 
 Our Software Solutions business provides the software and technology infrastructure for the transactional and technology related elements of the Freedom International Brokerage Company marketplace as well as certain other services in exchange for specified percentages of transaction revenue from the marketplace. 
 As part of our Software Solutions business, using our Lucera® brand we deliver technology solutions designed to be performant, secure and scalable and to power demanding financial applications across several offerings: LumeFX® (distributed FX platform with managed infrastructure and software stack), Connect™ (global SDN for rapid provisioning of connectivity to counter-parties), and Compute™ (on-demand, co-located compute services in key financial data centers).
 Our Post-Trade Services include post-trade risk mitigation services provided using our Capitalab brand. Capitalab, a division of BGC Brokers L.P. (“BGC Brokers”), provides compression services that are designed to bring greater capital and operational efficiency to the global derivatives market. It assists clients in managing the growing cost of holding derivatives, while helping them to meet their regulatory mandates. Through the Swaptioniser® service for portfolio compression of Interest Rate Swaptions, Interest Rate Swaps, Caps and Floors and FX Options, as well as Initial Margin Optimization service and fully automated trade processing, Capitalab looks to simplify the complexities of managing large quantities of derivatives to promote sustainable growth and lower systemic risk and to improve resiliency in the industry.
 Aqua Business 
 In October 2007, we spun off our former eSpeed Equities Direct business to form Aqua Securities, L.P. (“Aqua”), a business owned 51% by Cantor and 49% by us. Aqua’s purpose is to provide access to new block trading liquidity in the equities markets. The SEC has granted approval for Aqua to operate an Alternative Trading System in compliance with Regulation ATS. 
Insurance Brokerage 
 In February 2017, we completed the acquisition of Besso Insurance Group Limited (“Besso”) and in January 2019, we completed the acquisition of Ed Broking Group Limited (“Ed”), an independent Lloyd’s of London insurance broker. Through Besso

Customers and Clients
 We primarily serve the wholesale financial, energy, insurance, and/or inter-dealer brokerage markets, with clients, including many of the world’s largest banks, that regularly trade in capital markets, brokerage houses, investment firms, hedge funds, and investment banks. Customers using our branded products and services also include professional trading firms, futures commission merchants, and other professional market participants and financial institutions. Our market data products and services are available through many platforms and are available to a wide variety of capital market participants, including banks, investment banks, brokerage firms, asset managers, hedge funds, investment analysts and financial advisors. We also license our intellectual property portfolio and offerings in Software Solutions to various financial markets participants. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our top ten Financial Services customers, collectively, accounted for approximately 34.6% of our total revenue on a consolidated basis, and our largest customer accounted for approximately 4.8% of our total revenue on a consolidated basis. 
Sales and Marketing 
 Our brokers and salespeople are the primary marketing and sales resources to our customers. Thus, our sales and marketing program is aimed at enhancing the ability of our brokers to cross-sell effectively in addition to informing our customers about our product and service offerings. We also employ product teams and business development professionals. We leverage our customer relationships through a variety of direct marketing and sales initiatives and build and enhance our brand image through marketing and communications campaigns targeted at a diverse audience, including traders, potential partners and the investor and media 
 9


communities. We may also market to our existing and prospective customers through a variety of co-marketing/co-branding initiatives with our partners. 
 Our brokerage product team is composed of product managers who are each responsible for a specific part of our brokerage business. The product managers seek to ensure that our brokers, across all regions, have access to technical expertise, support and multiple execution methods in order to grow and market their business. This approach of combining marketing with our product and service strategy has enabled us to turn innovative ideas into both deliverable fully electronic and hybrid solutions, such as BGC Trader, our multi-asset hybrid offering to our customers for voice and electronic execution. 
 Our team of business development professionals is responsible for growing our global footprint through raising awareness of our products and services. The business development team markets our products and services to new and existing customers. As part of this process, they analyze existing levels of business with these entities in order to identify potential areas of growth and also to cross-sell our multiple offerings. 
 Our market data, software solutions, and post-trade products and services are promoted to our existing and prospective customers through a combination of sales, marketing and co-marketing campaigns. 
 Technology 
 Pre-Trade Technology. Our financial brokers use a suite of pricing and analytical tools that have been developed both in-house and in cooperation with specialist software suppliers. The pre-trade software suite combines proprietary market data, pricing and calculation libraries, together with those outsourced from what we believe to be the best-of-breed providers in the sector. The tools in turn publish to a normalized, global market data distribution platform, allowing prices and rates to be distributed to our proprietary network, data vendor pages, secure websites and trading applications as indicative pricing. 
 Inter-Dealer and Wholesale Trading Technology. We utilize a sophisticated proprietary electronic trading platform to provide execution and market data services to our customers. The services are available through our proprietary API, FIX and a multi-asset proprietary trading platform, operating under brands including BGC Trader™, CreditMatch®, Fenics®, GFI ForexMatch®, BGCForex™, BGCCredit™, BGCRates™, FenicsFX™ and FenicsUST™.  This platform presently supports a wide and constantly expanding range of products and services, which includes FX Options, corporate bonds, credit derivatives, OTC interest rate derivatives in multiple currencies, US REPO, TIPS, MBS, government bonds, spot FX, NDFs, and other products. Every product on the platform is supported in either view-only, hybrid/managed or fully electronic mode, and can be transitioned from one mode to the next in response to market demands. The flexible BGC technology stack is designed to support feature-rich work flows required by the hybrid mode as well as delivering high throughput and low transaction latency required by the fully-electronic mode. Trades executed by our customers in any mode are, when applicable, eligible for immediate electronic confirmation through direct straight-through processing (“STP”) links as well as STP hubs. The BGC trading platform services are operated out of several globally distributed data centers and delivered to customers over BGC’s global private network, third-party connectivity providers as well as the Internet. BGC’s proprietary graphical user interfaces and the API/FIX connectivity are deployed at hundreds of major banks and institutions and service thousands of users.
 Post-Trade Technology. Our platform automates previously paper and telephone-based transaction processing, confirmation and other functions, substantially improving and reducing the cost of many of our customers’ back offices and enabling STP. In addition to our own system, confirmation and trade processing is also available through third-party hubs, including MarkitWIRE, ICElink, Reuters RTNS, and STP in FIX for various banks. 
 We have electronic connections to most mainstream clearinghouses, including The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”), CLS Group, Euroclear, Clearstream, Monte Titoli, LCH.Clearnet, Eurex Clearing, CME Clearing and the Options Clearing Corporation (“OCC”). As more products become centrally cleared, and as our customers request that we use a particular venue, we expect to expand the number of clearinghouses to which we connect in the future. 
 
Systems Architecture. Our systems consist of layered components, which provide matching, credit management, market data distribution, position reporting, customer display and customer integration. The private network currently operates from six concurrent core data centers (three of which are in the U.K., one of which is in Trumbull, Connecticut, one of which is in Weehawken, New Jersey and one of which is in Secaucus, New Jersey) and seven hub cities throughout the world acting as distribution points for all private network customers. Our network hubs beyond the core data centers are in Chicago, Mexico City, Hong Kong, Săo Paolo, Singapore, Tokyo and Toronto. The redundant structure of our system provides multiple backup paths and re-routing of data transmission in the event of failure.
 10


In addition to our own network system, we also receive and distribute secure trading information from customers using the services of multiple, major Internet service providers throughout the world. These connections enable us to offer our products and services via the Internet to our global customers. 
 Software Development 
 We devote substantial efforts to the development and improvement of our hybrid and electronic marketplaces and licensed software products and services. We work with our customers to identify their specific requirements and make modifications to our software, network distribution systems and technologies that are responsive to those needs. Our efforts focus on internal development, strategic partnering, acquisitions and licensing. As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 600 technology professionals in our continuing operations. 
Our Intellectual Property 
 We regard our technology and intellectual property rights, including our brands, as a critical part of our business. We hold various trademarks, trade dress and trade names and rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, service mark and trade secret laws, as well as contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights.  We own numerous domain names and have registered numerous trademarks and/or service marks in the United States and foreign countries.  Our trademark registrations must be renewed periodically, and, in most jurisdictions, every 10 years.  
 We have adopted a comprehensive intellectual property program to protect our proprietary technology and innovations. We currently have licenses covering various patents from related parties. We also have agreements to license technology that may be covered by several pending and/or issued U.S. patent applications relating to various aspects of our electronic trading systems, including both functional and design aspects. We have filed a number of patent applications to further protect our proprietary technology and innovations, and have received patents for some of those applications. We will continue to file additional patent applications on new inventions, as appropriate, demonstrating our commitment to technology and innovation. 
 Our patent portfolio continues to grow and we continue to look for opportunities to license and/or otherwise monetize the patents in our portfolio.

Competition 
 We encounter competition in all aspects of our businesses. We compete primarily with other inter-dealer or wholesale brokers, including for brokers, salespeople, and suitable acquisition candidates. Our existing and potential competitors are numerous and include other wholesale financial brokerage and inter-dealer brokerage firms, multi-dealer trading companies, financial technology companies, market data and information vendors, securities and futures exchanges, electronic communications networks, crossing systems, software companies, financial trading consortia, insurance brokers, shipping brokers, business-to-business marketplace infrastructure companies, as well as niche market energy and other commodity Internet-based trading systems. 
 Inter-Dealer or Wholesale Financial Brokers 
 We primarily compete with two publicly traded diversified inter-dealer and/or wholesale financial brokers. These are TP ICAP plc (“TP ICAP”) (formerly known as “Tullett Prebon plc”) and Compagnie Financière Tradition (which is majority owned by Viel & Cie) (“Tradition”), Other such competitors include a number of smaller, private firms that tend to specialize in specific product areas or geographies, such as Marex Spectron Group Limited in energy and commodities and Gottex Brokers Holding SA in OTC interest rate derivatives.     
 Demand for services of brokers is directly affected by national and international economic and political conditions, broad trends in business and finance, the level and volatility of interest rates, changes in and uncertainty regarding tax laws and substantial fluctuations in the volume and price levels of securities transactions. Other significant factors affecting competition in the brokerage industry are the quality and ability of professional personnel, the depth and pricing efficiency of the markets in which the brokers transact, the strength of the technology used to service and execute on those markets and the relative prices of products and services offered by the brokers and by competing markets and trading processes. 
 Market Data and Financial Software Vendors 
 The majority of our large inter-dealer and wholesale financial broker competitors also sell proprietary market data and information, which competes with our market data offerings. In addition to direct sales, we resell market data through large market data and information providers. These companies have established significant presences on the vast majority of trading desks in our industry. Some of these market data and information providers, such as Bloomberg L.P. and Refinitiv (the former Financial & Risk business of Thomson Reuters Corporation), include in their product mix electronic trading and execution of both OTC and listed products in addition to their traditional market data offerings. 
Exchanges and Other Trading Platforms 
 Although our businesses will often use exchanges to execute transactions brokered in both listed and OTC markets, we believe that exchanges have sought and will seek to migrate products traditionally traded in OTC markets by inter-dealer and/or wholesale financial brokers to exchanges. However, we believe that when a product goes from OTC to exchange-traded, the underlying or related OTC market often continues to experience growth in line with the growth of the exchange-traded contract. In addition, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (“ICE”) operates both regulated exchanges and OTC execution services, and in the latter it competes directly with inter-dealer and/or wholesale financial brokers in energy, commodities, and credit products. ICE entered these OTC markets primarily by acquiring independent OTC brokers. We also compete with NEX Group plc (“NEX”) (formerly known as ICAP plc). CME Group Inc. (“CME”) announced in March of 2018 that it had agreed to acquire NEX and completed the acquisition in November of 2018.  We believe that it is likely ICE, CME, or other exchange operators may seek to compete with us in the future by acquiring other such brokers, by creating futures products designed to mimic OTC products, or through other means. 
 
In addition to exchanges, other electronic trading platforms which currently operate in the dealer-to-client markets, including those run by MarketAxess Holdings Inc., have begun to compete with us in the inter-dealer markets. At the same time, we have begun to offer an increasing number of our services to the customers of firms like MarketAxess. 
 Further, ICE also operates a swap execution facility (“SEF”), as does Tradeweb, and we expect that other exchanges and trading platforms may also seek to do so. 
 12


Banks and Broker-Dealers 
 Banks and broker-dealers have in the past created and/or funded consortia to compete with exchanges and inter-dealer brokers. For example, CME’s wholesale businesses for fully electronic trading of U.S. Treasuries and spot foreign exchange both began as dealer-owned consortia before being acquired by CME’s NEX platform. An example of a current and similar consortium is Tradeweb Markets LLC. Currently, several large banks hold stakes in Tradeweb, an Internet-based market intermediary. Refinitiv is Tradeweb’s single largest shareholder. Although Tradeweb operates primarily as a dealer to customer platform, some of its offerings include a voice and electronic inter-dealer platform and a SEF. In addition, Tradeweb’s management has said that it would like to expand into other inter-dealer markets, and as such may compete with us in other areas over time. 
 In addition, certain investment management firms that traditionally deal with banks and broker-dealers have expressed a desire to have direct access to certain parts of the wholesale financial markets via firms such as ours. We believe that over time, interdealer-brokers will therefore gain a small percentage of the sales and trading market currently dominated by banks and broker-dealers. Since their collective revenues are many times those of the global inter-dealer market, we believe that our gaining a small share of banks and broker-dealers’ revenues would lead to a meaningful increase in our Financial Services revenues. 
 Overall, we believe that we may also face future competition from market data and technology companies and some securities brokerage firms, some of which are currently our customers, as well as from any future strategic alliances, joint ventures or other partnerships created by one or more of our potential or existing competitors. 
 Seasonality 
 Traditionally, the financial markets around the world experience lower volume during the summer and at the end of the year due to a general slowdown in the business environment around holiday seasons, with our Financial Services revenues tending to be strongest in the first quarter and lowest in the fourth quarter. For the year 2017, we earned approximately 26% of our revenues from continuing operations in the first quarter, while in 2018 we earned 27% of such revenues in the first quarter.
Partnership Overview 
 We believe that our partnership structure is one of the unique strengths of our business. Many of our key brokers, salespeople and other front office professionals have their own capital invested in our business, aligning their interests with our stockholders. Limited partnership interests in BGC Holdings and Newmark Holdings consist of: (i) “founding/working partner units” held by limited partners who are employees; (ii) “limited partnership units,” which consist of a variety of units that are generally held by employees such as REUs, RPUs, PSUs, PSIs, PSEs, LPUs, APSUs, APSIs, APSEs, AREUs, ARPUs and NPSUs; (iii) “Cantor units” which are the exchangeable limited partnership interests held by Cantor entities; and (iv) preferred partnership units (“Preferred Units”), which are working partner units that may be awarded to holders of, or contemporaneous with, the grant of REUs, RPUs, PSUs, PSIs, PSEs, LPUs, APSUs, APSIs, APSEs, AREUs, ARPUs and NPSUs. For further details, see “Our Organizational Structure.” NPSUs are partnership units that are not entitled to participate in partnership distributions, not allocated any items of profit or loss and may not be exchangeable into shares of our common stock. On terms and conditions determined by the General Partner of the Partnership in its sole discretion, NPSUs are expected to be replaced by a grant of PSUs, PPSUs, LPUs or PLPUs, which may be set forth in a written schedule and subject to additional terms and conditions, provided that, in all circumstances such grant of PSUs, PPSUs, LPUs or PLPUs shall be contingent upon our, including our affiliates, earning, in aggregate, at least $5 million in gross revenues in the calendar quarter in which the applicable award of PSUs, PPSUs, LPUs, or PLPUs is to be granted. In addition, we have NREUs, NPREUs, NLPUs, NPLPUs and NPPSUs (collectively, the “N Units”) which are non-distributing partnership units that may not be allocated any item of profit or loss and may not be made exchangeable into shares of our Class A common stock. Subject to the approval of the Compensation Committee or its designee, the N Units are expected to be converted into the underlying unit type (i.e., an NREU will be converted into an REU) and then participate in Partnership distributions, subject to terms and conditions determined by the General Partner of the Partnership in its sole discretion, including that the recipient continue to provide substantial services to us and comply with his or her partnership obligations. 
 We believe that our partnership structure is an effective tool in recruiting, motivating and retaining key employees. Many brokers are attracted by the opportunity to become partners because the partnership agreement generally entitles partners to quarterly distributions of income from the partnership. While BGC Holdings limited partnership interests generally entitle our partners to participate in distributions of income from the operations of our business, upon leaving BGC Holdings (or upon any other redemption or purchase of such limited partnership interests as described below), any such partners are only entitled to receive over time, and provided he or she does not violate certain partner obligations, an amount for his or her BGC Holdings limited partnership interests that reflects such partner’s capital account or compensatory grant awards, excluding any goodwill or going concern value of our business unless Cantor, in the case of the founding partners, and we, as the general partner of BGC Holdings, otherwise determine. Our partners can receive the right to exchange their BGC Holdings limited partnership interests for shares of our Class A common stock (if, in the case of founding partners, Cantor so determines and, in the case of working partners and limited partnership unit holders, the BGC Holdings general partner, with Cantor’s consent, determines otherwise) and thereby realize any higher value 
 13


associated with our Class A common stock.  Similar provisions with respect to Newmark Holdings limited partnership interests are contained in the Newmark Holdings limited partnership agreement.  We believe that, having invested in us, partners feel a sense of responsibility for the health and performance of our business and have a strong incentive to maximize our revenues and profitability.

Regulation   
 U.S. Regulation 
 The financial services industry in the United States is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws. As registered broker-dealers, introducing brokers and Futures Commissions Merchants, and other types of regulated entities as described below, certain of our subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations which cover all aspects of financial services, including sales methods, trade practices, use and safekeeping of customers’ funds and securities, minimum capital requirements, recordkeeping, business practices, securities lending and financing of securities purchases and the conduct of associated persons. We and our subsidiaries also are subject to the various anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Commodity Exchange Act, certain state securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. We also may be subject to vicarious and controlling person liability for the activities of our subsidiaries and our officers, employees and affiliated persons. 
 The SEC is the federal agency primarily responsible for the administration of federal securities laws, including adopting rules and regulations applicable to broker-dealers (other than government securities broker-dealers) and enforcing both its rules regarding broker-dealers and the Treasury’s rules regarding government securities broker-dealers. In addition, we operate a number of platforms that are governed pursuant to SEC Regulation ATS. Broker-dealers are also subject to regulation by state securities administrators in those states in which they conduct business or have registered to do business. In addition, Treasury rules relating to trading government securities apply to such activities when engaged in by broker-dealers. The Commodities Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) is the federal agency primarily responsible for the administration of federal commodities future laws and other acts, including the adoption of rules applicable to Futures Commissions Merchants, Designated Contract Markets (“DCM”) and SEFs such as BGC Derivative Markets, L.P. (“BGC Derivative Markets”) and GFI Swaps Exchange LLC. 
 
Much of the regulation of broker-dealers’ operations in the United States has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations. These self-regulatory organizations adopt rules (which are subject to approval by the SEC) that govern the operations of broker-dealers and government securities broker-dealers and conduct periodic inspections and examinations of their operations. In the case of our U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries, the principal self-regulatory organization is FINRA. FINRA was formed from the consolidation of the NASD’s member regulation operations and the regulatory arm of the NYSE Group to act as the self-regulatory organization for all broker-dealers doing business within the United States. Accordingly, our U.S. subsidiaries are subject to both scheduled and unscheduled examinations by the SEC and FINRA. In our futures-related activities, our subsidiaries are also subject to the rules of the CFTC, futures exchanges of which they are members and the National Futures Association (“NFA”), a futures self-regulatory organization. 
 The changing regulatory environment, new laws that may be passed by Congress, and rules that may be promulgated by the SEC, the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the CFTC, the NFA, FINRA and other self-regulatory organizations, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules, if adopted, may directly affect our operations and profitability and those of our competitors and customers and of the securities markets in which we participate in a way that could adversely affect our businesses. 
 The SEC, self-regulatory organizations and state securities administrators conduct informal and formal investigations of possible improprieties or illegal action by broker-dealers and their “associated persons,” which could be followed by the institution of administrative, civil and/or criminal proceedings against broker-dealers and/or “associated persons.” Among the sanctions that may result if administrative, civil or criminal proceedings were ever instituted against us or our “associated persons” are injunctions, censure, fines, penalties, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or suspension or expulsion from the industry and, in rare instances, even imprisonment. The principal purpose of regulating and disciplining broker-dealers is to protect customers and the securities markets, rather than to protect broker-dealers or their creditors or equity holders. From time to time, our “associated persons” have 
 14


been and are subject to routine investigations, none of which to date have had a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. 
 In light of recent events in the U.S. and global financial markets, regulators and legislators in the U.S. and European Union (“EU”) continue to craft new laws and regulations for the global OTC derivatives markets, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), which became law in July 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates or encourages several reforms regarding derivatives, including new regulations for swaps markets creating impartiality considerations, additional pre- and post-trade transparency requirements, and heightened collateral or capital standards, as well as recommendations for the obligatory use of central clearing for most standardized derivatives. The law also requires that standardized OTC derivatives be traded in an open and non-exclusionary manner on a DCM or a SEF. The SEC is still in the process of finalizing rules for the implementation of many of these requirements, however the SEC has not indicated when they may release their rule set surrounding security-based SEFs. The actual implementation of such rules may be phased in over a longer period. 
As these rules require authorized execution facilities to maintain robust front-end and back-office IT capabilities and to make large and ongoing technology investments, and because these execution facilities may be supported by a variety voice and auction-based execution methodologies, we expect our hybrid and fully electronic trading capability to perform strongly in such an environment. 
 Similarly, while the Volcker Rule does not apply directly to us, the Volcker Rule may have a material impact on many of the banking and other institutions with which we do business or compete. There may be continued uncertainty regarding the Volcker Rule, its impact on various affected businesses, how those businesses will respond to it, and the effect that it will have on the markets in which we do business. 
 BGC Derivative Markets, and GFI Swaps Exchange LLC, our subsidiaries, began operating as SEFs on October 2, 2013. Both BGC Derivative Markets and GFI Swaps Exchange received permanent registration approval from the CFTC as SEFs on January 22, 2016. Mandatory Dodd-Frank Act compliant execution on SEFs by eligible U.S. persons commenced in February 2014 for “made available to trade” products, and a wide range of other rules relating to the execution and clearing of derivative products have been finalized with implementation periods in 2016 and beyond. 
 We believe that the November 2016 election results in the U.S. make it possible that some of the Dodd-Frank rules may be modified or repealed, which could be a net positive for our Financial Services business and its largest customers. Along these lines, the U.S. Treasury, in a report released in June 2017, called for streamlining of rules and easing regulatory burdens on banks. However, there can be no assurance that these rules will be amended, and we continue to expect the industry to be more heavily regulated than it was prior to the financial crisis of 2008-2009, and we are prepared to operate under a variety of regulatory regimes.  While we continue to have compliance framework in place to comply with both existing and proposed rules and regulations, it is possible that the existing regulatory framework may be amended or relaxed. 
  In November 2018, the CFTC proposed significant revisions to CFTC Rule Part 37, which relates to SEFs. The proposed rules would significantly affect the trading of swaps and the facilities offering swaps trading.  The Chairman of the CFTC has recently indicated that the comment period on the proposed rules has been extended to March 15, 2019.  The proposed rules would allow for trading through “any means of interstate commerce” rather than the two methods prescribed under the current rules. The proposed rules may also expand the number and type of swaps required to be executed on SEFs. If these rules are passed, the Company’s SEFs would need to make numerous changes to facilitate trading under the new regulatory framework.
U.K. and European Regulation 
 The Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) is the relevant statutory regulator for the United Kingdom financial services industry. The FCA’s objectives are to protect customers, maintain the stability of the financial services industry and promote competition between financial services providers. It has broad rule-making, investigative and enforcement powers derived from the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and subsequent and derivative legislation and regulations. The FCA’s recent focus has been on liquidity risk management and separation of business and prudential regulation. Currently, we have subsidiaries and branches regulated by the FCA (BGC Brokers L.P., the U.K. branch of Aurel BGC, GFI Securities Ltd., GFI Brokers Limited and Sunrise Brokers LLP). 
 
From time to time, we have been and are subject to periodic examinations, inspections and investigations, including periodic risk assessment and related reviews of our U.K. group. As a result of such reviews, we may be required to include or enhance certain regulatory structures and frameworks in our operating procedures, systems and controls. We are also required to obtain approval from the FCA to acquire control of U.K.-regulated firms. 
 15


Increasingly, the FCA has developed a practice of requiring senior officers of regulated firms to provide individual attestations or undertakings as to the status of a firm’s control environment, compliance with specific rules and regulations, or the completion of required tasks. Officers of BGC Brokers L.P. and GFI Brokers Limited have given such attestations or undertakings in the past and may do so again in the future. Similarly, the FCA can seek a voluntary requirement notice, which is a voluntary undertaking on behalf of a firm that is made publicly available on the FCA’s website. 
 Recent European Regulatory Developments 
 The European Market Infrastructure Regulation on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories (“EMIR”) was adopted in July 2012. EMIR fulfills several of the EU’s G20 commitments to reform OTC derivatives markets. The reforms are designed to reduce systemic risk and bring more transparency to both OTC and listed derivatives markets. EMIR derivatives rules will apply initially to financial and non-financial firms that are counterparties to derivatives contracts in the EU and later to those trading outside the EU under certain circumstances. 
 Along with the implementation of EMIR reporting requirements, the Regulation on Wholesale Energy Markets Integrity and Transparency (“REMIT”) Implementation Acts became effective on January 7, 2015. The REMIT Implementing Acts developed by the European Commission define the details of reporting under REMIT, drawing up the list of reportable contracts and derivatives; defining details, timing and form of reporting, and establishing harmonized rules to report that information to the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (“ACER”). They enable ACER to collect information in relation to wholesale energy market transactions and fundamentals through the Agency’s REMIT Information System (ARIS), to analyze this data to detect market abuse and to report suspicious events to the National Competent Authorities, which are responsible for investigating these matters further, and if required, imposing sanctions. Market participants and third parties reporting on their behalf have had to: (i) report transactions executed at organized market places and fundamental data from the central information transparency platforms; and (ii)  report transactions in the remaining wholesale energy contracts (OTC standard and non-standard supply contracts, transportation contracts) and additional fundamental data. 
 To achieve a high level of harmonization and convergence in regular supervisory reporting requirements, the Committee of European Banking Supervisors issued guidelines on prudential reporting with the aim of developing a supervisory reporting framework based on common formats, known as COREP. COREP has become part of European Banking Authorities’ implementing technical standards on reporting under Basel III. Basel III (or the Third Basel Accord) is a global regulatory standard on bank capital adequacy, stress testing and market liquidity risk introduced by bank regulators in most, if not all, of the world’s major economies. Basel III is designed to strengthen bank capital requirements and introduces new regulatory requirements on bank liquidity and bank leverage. The ongoing adoption of these rules could restrict the ability of our large bank and broker-dealer customers to operate proprietary trading businesses and to maintain current capital market exposures under the present structure of their balance sheets, and will cause these entities to need to raise additional capital in order to stay active in our marketplaces. Meanwhile, global “Basel IV” standards are expected be adopted in the years to come. 
 Much of our global derivatives volumes continue to be executed by non-U.S. based clients outside the U.S. and subject to local prudential regulations. As such, we will continue to operate a number of EU regulated venues in accordance with EU directives and licensed by the FCA and other EU based national Competent Authorities. The second Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (“MiFID II”) was published by the European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) in September 2015, and implemented in January 2018
 MiFID II requires a significant part of the market in these instruments to trade on trading venues subject to pre- and post- trade transparency regimes and non-discriminatory fee structures and access.  In addition, it has had a particularly significant impact in a number of key areas, including corporate governance, transaction reporting, technology synchronization, best execution and investor protection.  
 MiFID II is intended to help improve the functioning of the EU single market by achieving a greater consistency of regulatory standards. By design, therefore, it is intended that Member States should have very similar regulatory regimes in relation to the matters addressed to MiFID. MiFID II also introduced a new regulated execution venue category to accompany the existing Multilateral Trading Facility regime. The new venue category is known as an Organized Trading Facility (“OTF”) and it captures much of the voice and hybrid oriented trading in EU, Certain of our existing EU derivatives and fixed income execution business now take place on OTFs, and we currently operate one OTF for each of the U.K. regulated entities, and one MTF under GFI Securities Limited. Authorization from the French Autorité des marchés financiers (“AMF”) has also been obtained to operate an OTF at Aurel BGC.  
 On June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum regarding continued membership in the EU. The exit from the EU is commonly referred to as “Brexit.” The Brexit vote passed by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum was non-binding. However, on March 29, 2017, the Prime Minister gave the European Council of the EU formal written notification of the U.K.’s intention to leave the EU, triggering the withdrawal process under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. Although the U.K. government and the EU negotiated a withdrawal agreement 
 16


that was approved by the leaders of EU member states, the agreement failed on January 16, 2019 to receive U.K. parliamentary approval. While negotiations are continuing, there remains considerable uncertainty around the withdrawal. Failure to obtain parliamentary approval of an agreed withdrawal agreement may, absent a revocation of the U.K.’s notification to withdraw or some other delay, mean that the U.K. would leave the EU on March 29, 2019 with no agreement (a so-called “hard Brexit”). Absent mitigating legislative measures by individual EU Member States, in the event of a hard Brexit the trade relationship between the U.K. and the EU would be solely based on World Trade Organization terms, thereby hindering current levels of mutual market access. If the U.K. and the EU do reach a deal by March 29, 2019 or delay such date, and when the deal takes effect or such delay, a transition period may start that lasts until December 31, 2020. Based upon the currently proposed transition plan, during this period, the U.K. would, with some exceptions, remain subject to EU law. It would also maintain access to the EU’s single market. During this transition phase, the U.K. and EU would also start negotiations on their future trade relationship. 
 In addition, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) came into effect in the EU on May 25, 2018 and creates obligations in relation to personal data.  In addition to the increased cost of compliance, the GDPR may affect our practices and will increase financial penalties for non-compliance significantly. 
 Around autumn of 2019, a new European Commission will take office which will lay out its plans for legislation and regulation of financial services for the next five years. We are unable to predict how any of these new laws and proposed rules and regulations in the U.S. or the U.K. will be implemented or in what form, or whether any additional or similar changes to statutes or rules and regulations, including the interpretation or implementation thereof or a relaxation or other amendment of existing rules and regulations, will occur in the future. Any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including important changes in market infrastructure, increased reporting costs and a potential rearrangement in the sources of available revenue in a more transparent market.  Certain enhanced regulations could subject us to the risk of fines, sanctions, enhanced oversight, increased financial and capital requirements and additional restrictions or limitations on our ability to conduct or grow our businesses, and could otherwise have an adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We believe that uncertainty and potential delays around the final form of such new rules and regulations may negatively impact our customers and trading volumes in certain markets in which we transact, although a relaxation of existing rules and requirements could potentially have a positive impact in certain markets. Increased capital requirements may also diminish transaction velocity.
 We believe that it remains premature to know conclusively the specific aspects of the U.S. and EU proposals that may directly affect our businesses, as some proposals have not yet been finalized and others which have been proposed remain subject to supervisory debate. While we generally believe the net impact of the rules and regulations may be positive for our businesses, it is possible that unintended consequences of the rules and regulations may materially adversely affect us in ways yet to be determined. 
 Insurance Regulation
 Our insurance business is regulated by various national regulators, such as the FCA in the U.K., the Monetary Authority of Singapore in Singapore and the Dubai Financial Supervisory Authority in Dubai. Our insurance operations adhere to the statutory regulatory requirements but there are occasions where regulators will conduct periodic thematic reviews into specific practices and procedures within a chosen market. We fully comply with these reviews however we may become subject of these reviews at any point, often with little or no notice.

Capital Requirements 
 U.S. 
 Every U.S.-registered broker-dealer is subject to the Uniform Net Capital Requirements. Futures Commissions Merchants (“FCMs”), such as our subsidiaries, BGC Financial and Mint Brokers (“Mint”), are also subject to CFTC capital requirements. These requirements are designed to ensure financial soundness and liquidity by prohibiting a broker or dealer from engaging in business at a time when it does not satisfy minimum net capital requirements. 
 In the United States, net capital is essentially defined as net worth (assets minus liabilities), plus qualifying subordinated borrowings and less certain mandatory deductions that result from excluding assets that are not readily convertible into cash and from conservatively valuing certain other assets, such as a firm’s positions in securities. Among these deductions are adjustments, commonly referred to as “haircuts,” to the market value of securities positions to reflect the market risk of such positions prior to their liquidation or disposition. The Uniform Net Capital Requirements also impose a minimum ratio of debt to equity, which may include qualified subordinated borrowings. 
 Regulations have been adopted by the SEC that prohibit the withdrawal of equity capital of a broker-dealer, restrict the ability of a broker-dealer to distribute or engage in any transaction with a parent company or an affiliate that results in a reduction of equity capital or to provide an unsecured loan or advance against equity capital for the direct or indirect benefit of certain persons related to the broker-dealer (including partners and affiliates) if the broker-dealer’s net capital is, or would be as a result of such withdrawal, distribution, reductions, loan or advance, below specified thresholds of excess net capital. In addition, the SEC’s regulations require certain notifications to be provided in advance of such withdrawals, distributions, reductions, loans and advances that exceed, in the aggregate, 30% of excess net capital within any 30-day period. The SEC has the authority to restrict, for up to 20 business days, such withdrawal, distribution or reduction of capital if the SEC concludes that it may be detrimental to the financial integrity of the broker-dealer or may expose its customers or creditors to loss. Notice is required following any such withdrawal, distribution, reduction, loan or advance that exceeds, in the aggregate, 20% of excess net capital within any 30 day period. The SEC’s regulations limiting withdrawals of excess net capital do not preclude the payment to employees of “reasonable compensation.” 
 Five of our subsidiaries, BGCF, GFI Securities LLC, Kyte Securities LLC, Sunrise Brokers LLC and Mint, are registered with the SEC and are subject to the Uniform Net Capital Requirements. As FCMs, BGCF and Mint are also subject to CFTC minimum capital requirements. In December of 2018, BGCF submitted an application with the CFTC to withdraw its FCM license.  After the withdrawal is approved, BGCF will conduct its business as an Introducing Broker registered with the NFA.  BGCF is also a member of the FICC, which imposes capital requirements on its members. We also hold a 49% limited partnership interest in Aqua, a U.S. registered broker-dealer and ATS. In addition, our SEFs, BGC Derivative Markets and GFI Swaps Exchange are required to maintain financial resources to cover operating costs for at least one year, keeping at least enough cash or highly liquid securities to cover six months’ operating costs. Compliance with the Uniform Net Capital Requirements may limit the extent and nature of our operations requiring the use of our registered broker-dealer subsidiaries’ capital, and could also restrict or preclude our ability to withdraw capital from our broker-dealer subsidiaries or SEFs. 
 Non-U.S. 
 Our international operations are also subject to capital requirements in their local jurisdictions. BGC Brokers, BGC European Holdings, L.P., GFI Brokers Limited. GFI Securities Limited, and Sunrise Brokers LLP, which are based in the United Kingdom, are subject to capital requirements established by the FCA. The FCA applies stringent provisions with respect to capital applicable to the operation of these firms, which vary depending upon the nature and extent of their activities. EU policymakers are currently reviewing the capital regime applying to EU Investment Firms.  
 In addition, the majority of our other foreign subsidiaries are subject to similar regulation by the relevant authorities in the countries in which they do business. Additionally, certain other of our foreign subsidiaries are required to maintain non-U.S. net capital requirements. For example, in Hong Kong, BGC Securities (Hong Kong), LLC, GFI (HK) Securities LLC and Sunrise Broker (Hong Kong) Limited are regulated by the Securities and Futures Commission. BGC Capital Markets (Hong Kong), Limited and GFI (HK) Brokers Ltd, are regulated by The Hong Kong Monetary Authority. All are subject to Hong Kong net capital requirements. In France, Aurel BGC and BGC France Holdings; in Australia, BGC Partners (Australia) Pty Limited, BGC (Securities) Pty Limited and GFI Australia Pty Ltd.; in Japan, BGC Shoken Kaisha Limited’s Tokyo branch and BGC Capital Markets Japan LLC’s Tokyo Branch; in Singapore, BGC Partners (Singapore) Limited, and GFI Group Pte Ltd; in Korea, BGC Capital Markets & Foreign Exchange Broker (Korea) Limited and GFI Korea Money Brokerage Limited; and in Turkey, BGC Partners Menkul Degerler AS, all have net capital requirements imposed upon them by local regulators. In addition, the LCH (LIFFE/LME) clearing organization, of which BGC Brokers L.P. is a member, also imposes minimum capital requirements. In Latin America, BGC Liquidez Distribuidora De Titulos E Valores Mobiliarios Ltda. (Brazil) has net capital requirements imposed upon it by local regulators. 
 19


We had net assets in our regulated subsidiaries of $551.3 million and $515.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, following the Spin-Off, we had 4,688 total employees. 
 As of the same date, following the Spin-Off, we had 2,600 brokers, salespeople, managers and other front-office personnel. Approximately 27% of our brokers, salespeople, managers and other front-office personnel were based in the Americas, and approximately 52% were based in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, with the remaining approximately 21 % based in the Asia-Pacific region. 
 Generally, our employees are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements, except for certain reimbursable employees within our former Real Estate Services segment, and certain of our employees based in our European offices that are covered by the national, industry-wide collective bargaining agreements relevant to the countries in which they work.
 Our Financial Services business’ two largest offices are located at One Churchill Place, London,  E14 5RD and 199 Water Street, 19th Floor, New York, NY 10038. Our former Real Estate Services business’ principal executive offices are located at 125 Park Avenue, New York, New York, 10017.  This office consists of approximately 130,000 square feet of space under a lease that expires in 2031. During 2019, we will be relocating our London offices to Five Churchill Place, London, E14 5HU, which is next door to our current London offices. 
 BGC operates out of over 50 offices around the world. Currently, our former Real Estate Services business operates out of 129 offices in 90 cities, with an additional 27 licensee locations.

 OUR ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE 
 
Stock Ownership 
 As of December 31, 2018, there were 291,474,768 shares of our Class A common stock outstanding.  On June 21, 2017, Cantor pledged 10,000,000 shares of our Class A common stock in connection with a partner loan program. On November 23, 2018, those Class A shares were converted into 10,000,000 shares of our Class B common stock and remain pledged in connection with the partner loan program. On November 23, 2018, BGC Partners issued 10,323,366 shares of BGC Partners Class B common stock to Cantor and 712,907 shares of BGC Partners Class B common stock to CFGM, an affiliate of Cantor, in each case in exchange for shares of our Class A common stock from Cantor and CFGM, respectively, on a one-to-one basis pursuant to Cantor’s and CFGM’s right to exchange such shares under the letter agreement, dated as of June 5, 2015, by and between BGC Partners and Cantor (the “Exchange Agreement” and such issuance, the “Class B Issuance”). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, no additional consideration was paid to BGC Partners by Cantor or CFGM for the Class B Issuance. The Class B Issuance was exempt from registration pursuant to Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act. As of December 31, 2018, Cantor and CFGM did not own any shares of our Class A common stock. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote on matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. 
 In addition, as of December 31, 2018, Cantor and CFGM held 45,884,380 shares of our Class B common stock (which represents all of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock), representing approximately 61.2% of our voting power on such date. Each share of Class B common stock is generally entitled to the same rights as a share of Class A common stock, except that, on matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, each share of Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes. The Class B common stock generally votes together with the Class A common stock on all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. 
 Through December 31, 2018, Cantor has distributed to its current and former partners an aggregate of 20,836,626 shares of our Class A common stock, consisting of (i) 19,372,634 shares to satisfy certain of Cantor’s deferred stock distribution obligations provided to such partners on April 1, 2008 (the “April 2008 distribution rights shares”), and (ii) 1,463,992 shares to satisfy certain of Cantor’s deferred stock distribution obligations provided to such partners on February 14, 2012 in connection with Cantor’s payment of previous quarterly partnership distributions (the “February 2012 distribution rights shares”). As of December 31, 2018, Cantor is still obligated 
 20


to distribute to its current and former partners an aggregate of 15,770,345 shares of our Class A common stock, consisting of 13,999,110 April 2008 distribution rights shares and 1,771,235 February 2012 distribution rights shares.
 We received shares of Newmark in connection with the Separation, and Newmark completed the Newmark IPO on December 19, 2017. However, on the Distribution Date, we completed our previously announced Spin-Off to our stockholders of all of the shares of common stock of Newmark owned by us as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Spin-Off. Following the Spin-Off, we ceased to be Newmark’s controlling stockholder, and we and our subsidiaries no longer held any shares of Newmark’s common stock or other equity interests in Newmark or its subsidiaries. For more information on the Spin-Off of Newmark, see Note 1—“Organization and Basis of Presentation” to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Overview and Business Environment –Newmark IPO, Separation Transaction and Spin-Off” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Overview and Business Environment.” 
  From time to time, we may actively continue to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock including from Cantor, Newmark, our executive officers, other employees, partners and others. 
 
BGC Partners, Inc. Partnership Structure  
 We are a holding company with no direct operations, and our business is operated through two operating partnerships, BGC Partners, L.P. (“BGC U.S. OpCo” or “BGC U.S.”), which holds our U.S. businesses, and BGC Global Holdings, L.P. (“BGC Global OpCo” or “BGC Global”), which holds our non-U.S. businesses. The limited partnership interests of the two operating partnerships are held by us and BGC Holdings, and the limited partnership interests of BGC Holdings are currently held by limited partnership unit holders, founding partners, and Cantor. We hold the BGC Holdings general partnership interest and the BGC Holdings special voting limited partnership interest, which entitle us to remove and appoint the general partner of BGC Holdings, and serve as the general partner of BGC Holdings, which entitles us to control BGC Holdings. BGC Holdings, in turn, holds the BGC U.S. OpCo general partnership interest and the BGC U.S. OpCo special voting limited partnership interest, which entitle the holder thereof to remove and appoint the general partner of BGC U.S. OpCo, and the BGC Global OpCo general partnership interest and the BGC Global OpCo special voting limited partnership interest, which entitle the holder thereof to remove and appoint the general partner of BGC Global OpCo, and serves as the general partner of BGC U.S. OpCo and BGC Global OpCo, all of which entitle BGC Holdings (and thereby us) to control each of BGC U.S. OpCo and BGC Global OpCo. BGC Holdings holds its BGC Global OpCo general partnership interest through a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands, BGC Global Holdings GP Limited.
 As of December 31, 2018, we held directly and indirectly, through wholly owned subsidiaries, BGC U.S. OpCo limited partnership interests and BGC Global OpCo limited partnership interests consisting of 337,359,148 units and 337,359,148 units, representing approximately 66.9% and 66.9% of the outstanding BGC U.S. OpCo limited partnership interests and BGC Global OpCo limited partnership interests, respectively. As of that date, BGC Holdings held BGC U.S. OpCo limited partnership interests and BGC Global OpCo limited partnership interests consisting of 167,233,715 units and 167,233,715 units, representing approximately 33.1% and 33.1% of the outstanding BGC U.S. OpCo limited partnership interests and BGC Global OpCo limited partnership interests, respectively. 
 Limited partnership unit holders, founding partners, and Cantor directly hold BGC Holdings limited partnership interests. Since BGC Holdings in turn holds BGC U.S. OpCo limited partnership interests and BGC Global OpCo limited partnership interests, limited partnership unit holders, founding partners, and Cantor indirectly have interests in BGC U.S. OpCo limited partnership interests and BGC Global OpCo limited partnership interests. Further, in connection with the Separation and Distribution Agreement, limited partnership interests in Newmark Holdings were distributed to the holders of limited partnership interests in BGC Holdings, whereby each holder of BGC Holdings limited partnership interests who at that time held a BGC Holdings limited partnership interest received a corresponding Newmark Holdings limited partnership interest, equal in number to a BGC Holdings limited partnership interest divided by 2.2 (i.e., 0.454545 of a unit in Newmark Holdings). Accordingly, existing partners at the time of the Separation in BGC Holdings are also partners in Newmark Holdings and hold corresponding units issued at the applicable ratio. Thus, such partners now also have an indirect interest in Newmark OpCo. 
 As of December 31, 2018, excluding Preferred Units and NPSUs described below, outstanding BGC Holdings partnership interests included 113,119,518 limited partnership units, 12,555,760 founding partner units and 52,362,964 Cantor units. 
 We may in the future effect additional redemptions of BGC Holdings limited partnership units and founding partner units and concurrently grant shares of our Class A common stock. We may also continue our earlier partnership restructuring programs, whereby we redeemed or repurchased certain limited partnership units and founding partner units in exchange for new units, grants of exchangeability for our Class A common stock or cash and, in many cases, obtained modifications or extensions of partners’ employment arrangements. We also generally expect to continue to grant exchange rights with respect to outstanding non-exchangeable limited partnership units and founding partner units, and to repurchase BGC Holdings partnership interests from time to time, including from Cantor, our executive officers, and other employees and partners, unrelated to our partnership restructuring programs. 
 21


Cantor units in BGC Holdings are generally exchangeable for up to 23,610,420 shares of our Class B common stock (or, at Cantor’s option or if there are no such additional authorized but unissued shares of our Class B common stock, our Class A common stock) on a one-for-one basis (subject to adjustments). Upon certain circumstances, Cantor may have the right to acquire additional Cantor units in connection with the redemption of or grant of exchangeability to certain non-exchangeable BGC Holdings founding partner units owned by persons who were previously Cantor partners prior to our 2008 acquisition of the BGC business from Cantor. Cantor has exercised this right from time to time. 
 As of December 31, 2018, there were 1,472,398 FPUs remaining which BGC Holdings had the right to redeem or exchange and with respect to which Cantor had the right to purchase an equivalent number of Cantor units. 
 In order to facilitate partner compensation and for other corporate purposes, the BGC Holdings limited partnership agreement provides for preferred partnership units (“Preferred Units”), which are working partner units that may be awarded to holders of, or contemporaneous with the grant of, PSUs, PSIs, PSEs, LPUs, APSUs, APSIs, APSEs, REUs, RPUs, AREUs, and ARPUs. These Preferred Units carry the same name as the underlying unit, with the insertion of an additional “P” to designate them as Preferred Units. 
 Such Preferred Units may not be made exchangeable into our Class A common stock and accordingly will not be included in the fully diluted share count. Each quarter, the net profits of BGC Holdings are allocated to such Units at a rate of either 0.6875% (which is 2.75% per calendar year) of the allocation amount assigned to them based on their award price, or such other amount as set forth in the award documentation (the “Preferred Distribution”), before calculation and distribution of the quarterly Partnership distribution for the remaining Partnership units. The Preferred Units will not be entitled to participate in Partnership distributions other than with respect to the Preferred Distribution. As of December 31, 2018, there were 23,552,667 such units granted and outstanding in BGC Holdings. 
 On June 5, 2015, we entered into an agreement with Cantor providing Cantor, CFGM and other Cantor affiliates entitled to hold our Class B common stock the right to exchange from time to time, on a one-to-one basis, subject to adjustment, up to an aggregate of 34,649,693 shares of our Class A common stock now owned or subsequently acquired by such Cantor entities for up to an aggregate of 34,649,693 shares of our Class B common stock. Such shares of our Class B common stock, which currently can be acquired upon the exchange of exchangeable limited partnership units owned in our Holdings, are already included in the Company’s fully diluted share count and will not increase Cantor’s current maximum potential voting power in the common equity. The exchange agreement will enable the Cantor entities to acquire the same number of shares of our Class B common stock that they are already entitled to acquire without having to exchange their exchangeable limited partnership units in our Holdings. 
 Under the exchange agreement, Cantor and CFGM have the right to exchange shares of our Class A common stock owned by them for the same number of shares of our Class B common stock. As of December 31, 2018, Cantor and CFGM do not own any shares of our Class A common stock. Cantor and CFGM would also have the right to exchange any shares of our Class A common stock subsequently acquired by either of them for shares of our Class B common stock, up to 23,613,420 shares of our Class B common stock.
 We and Cantor have agreed that any shares of our Class B common stock issued in connection with the exchange agreement would be deducted from the aggregate number of shares of our Class B common stock that may be issued to the Cantor entities upon exchange of exchangeable limited partnership units in BGC Holdings. Accordingly, the Cantor entities will not be entitled to receive any more shares of our Class B common stock under this agreement than they were previously eligible to receive upon exchange of exchangeable limited partnership units. 
 Non-distributing partnership units, or N Units, carry the same name as the underlying unit with the insertion of an additional “N” to designate them as the N Unit type and are designated as NREUs, NPREUs, NLPUs, NPLPUs and NPPSUs. The N Units are not entitled to participate in Partnership distributions, will not be allocated any items of profit or loss and may not be made exchangeable into shares of our Class A common stock. Subject to the approval of the Compensation Committee or its designee, certain N Units may be converted into the underlying unit type (i.e. an NREU will be converted into an REU) and will then participate in Partnership distributions, subject to terms and conditions determined by the general partner of BGC Holdings, in its sole discretion, including that the recipient continue to provide substantial services to the Company and comply with his or her partnership obligations. 
 On December 13, 2017, the Amended and Restated BGC Holdings Partnership Agreement was amended and restated (the “Second Amended and Restated BGC Holdings Partnership Agreement”) to include prior standalone amendments and to make certain other changes related to the Separation. The Second Amended and Restated BGC Holdings Partnership Agreement, among other things, reflects changes resulting from the division in the Separation of BGC Holdings into BGC Holdings and Newmark Holdings, including:
  
• | an apportionment of the existing economic attributes (including, among others, capital accounts and post-termination payments) of each BGC Holdings limited partnership unit outstanding immediately prior to the Separation (a “Legacy BGC Holdings Unit”) between such Legacy BGC Holdings Unit and the 0.454545 of a Newmark Holdings limited
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 22


 
partnership unit issued in the Separation in respect of each such Legacy BGC Holdings Unit, based on the relative value of BGC and Newmark as of after the Newmark IPO; and
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a right of the employer of a partner to determine whether to grant exchangeability with respect to Legacy BGC Holdings Units held by such partner.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Second Amended and Restated BGC Holdings Partnership Agreement also removes certain classes of BGC Holdings units that are no longer outstanding, and permits the general partner of BGC Holdings to determine the total number of authorized BGC Holdings units. The Second Amended and Restated BGC Holdings Limited Partnership Agreement was approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company.
 The following diagram illustrates our organizational structure as of December 31, 2018, following the Spin-Off. The diagram does not reflect the various subsidiaries of BGC, BGC U.S. OpCo, BGC Global OpCo, or Cantor, or the noncontrolling interests in our consolidated subsidiaries other than Cantor’s units in BGC Holdings.*

STRUCTURE OF BGC PARTNERS, INC. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018


*Shares of our Class B common stock are convertible into shares of our Class A common stock at any time in the discretion of the holder on a one-for-one basis. Accordingly, if Cantor and CFGM converted all of their BGC Class B common stock into Class A common stock, Cantor would hold 13.4% of the voting power, CFGM would hold 0.2% of the voting power, and the public stockholders would hold 86.4% of the voting power (and Cantor and CFGM’s indirect economic interests in BGC U.S. and BGC Global would remain unchanged). The diagram does not reflect certain BGC Class A common stock and BGC Holdings partnership units as follows: (a) any 
 24


shares of Class A common stock that may become issuable upon the conversion or exchange of any convertible or exchangeable debt securities that may in the future be sold under our shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-180331); (b) 23,552,667 Preferred Units granted and outstanding to BGC Holdings partners (see “BGC Partners, Inc. Partnership Structure” herein); and (c) 7,696,727 N Units granted and outstanding to BGC Holdings partners.
 The diagram reflects Class A common stock and BGC Holdings partnership unit activity from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018 as follows: (a) an aggregate of 30,847,027 limited partnership units granted by BGC Holdings; (b) 17,224,515 shares of Class A common stock sold by us under the April 2017 Sales Agreement pursuant to our Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-214772); (c) 16,539,792 shares of Class A common stock sold by us under the March 2018 Sales Agreement pursuant to our Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-223550), but not the remaining $95.5 million of stock remaining for sale by us under such sales agreement; (d) 788,788 shares of Class A common stock repurchased by us; (e) 527,951 shares of Class A common stock issued for vested restricted stock units; (f) 1,743,963 shares of Class A common stock issued by us under our acquisition shelf Registration Statement on Form S-4 (Registration No. 333-169232), but not the 7,208,327 of such shares remaining available for issuance by us under such Registration Statement; (g) 92,483 shares issued by us under our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-173109), but not the 9,565,891 of such shares remaining available for issuance by us under shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-196999); and (h) 18,942 shares sold by selling stockholders under our resale shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-175034), but not the 964,318 of such shares remaining available for sale by selling stockholders under such Registration Statement.

Newmark Real Estate Services Business (Discontinued Operations)
 Until the Spin-Off on November 30, 2018, we offered Real Estate Services through Newmark. Newmark completed its initial public offering on December 19, 2017, and its Class A common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “NMRK.” Newmark operates as a full-service commercial real estate services business that offers a diverse array of integrated services and products designed to meet the full needs of both real estate investors/owners and occupiers.  Newmark’s investor/owner services and products include capital markets (including investment sales), agency leasing, property management, valuation and appraisal, commercial real estate due diligence consulting and underwriting. Newmark Group’s subsidiaries also offer government sponsored enterprise (“GSE”) lending, loan servicing, mortgage broking, and equity raising. Newmark’s occupier services and products include tenant representation leasing, Global Corporate Services and consulting (“GCS”), real estate management technology systems, workplace and occupancy strategy, project management, lease administration and facilities management. Newmark enhances these services and products through innovative real estate technology solutions and data analytics designed to enable its clients to increase their efficiency and profits by optimizing their real estate portfolio. Newmark has relationships with many of the world’s largest commercial property owners, real estate developers and investors, as well as Fortune 500 and Forbes Global 2000 companies.
 Newmark offers innovative real estate technology solutions for both investors/owners and occupiers that enable its clients to increase efficiency and realize additional profits. Newmark’s differentiated, value-added and client-facing technology platforms have been utilized by clients that occupy nearly 4.5 billion square feet of commercial real estate space globally. Newmark’s N360™ platform is a powerful tool that is designed to provide access and comprehensive commercial real estate data in one place via mobile or desktop.  For its occupier clients, the Newmark VISION™ platform is designed to provide integrated business intelligence, reporting and analytics. Newmark’s deep and growing real estate database and commitment to providing innovative technological solutions empower it to provide its clients with value-adding technology products and data-driven advice and analytics.
 Newmark, N (stylized), RKF, Grubb & Ellis, Apartment Realty Advisors, ARA, Computerized Facility Integration, CFI, Spring11, Landauer, Excess Space, Excess Space Retail Services, Inc., Berkeley Point and Grubb are trademarks/service marks, and/or registered trademarks/service marks of Newmark Group, Inc. and/or its affiliates.  Knight Frank is a service mark of Knight Frank (Nominees) Limited.  
 Knight Frank Partnership
 Newmark offers services to clients on a global basis. In 2005, Newmark partnered with London-based Knight Frank in order to enhance its ability to provide best-in-class local service to its clients, throughout the world. Knight Frank is a leading independent, global real estate services firm providing integrated prime and commercial real estate services and operates in over 200 key office hubs across Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Australia and Africa. Outside of the Americas, Newmark collaborates with Knight Frank to ensure that its clients have access to local expertise and to highly-skilled professionals in the locales where they choose to transact. Newmark expects that its cross-selling efforts with Knight Frank will lead to continued growth, particularly as its growing capital markets business increases its penetration with foreign investors.
 While Newmark has the right to expand its international operations, it may be subject to certain short-term contractual restrictions due to its existing agreement with Knight Frank, which was extended, effective December 28, 2017, for a three-year period with a 90-day mutual termination right. The agreement restricts the parties from operating a competing commercial real estate business in the other party’s areas of responsibility. Newmark’s areas of responsibility are North America and South America. Knight Frank’s areas of responsibility are the Asia-Pacific region, Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
 Domestic and Latin American Real Estate Services Alliances
 In certain smaller markets in the United States and in countries in the Americas in which Newmark does not maintain owned offices, it has agreements in place to operate on a collaborative and cross-referral basis with certain independently-owned offices in return for contractual and referral fees paid to Newmark and/or certain mutually beneficial co-branding and other business arrangements. Newmark does not derive a significant portion of its revenue from these relationships. These independently owned offices generally use some variation of Newmark’s branding in their names and marketing materials. These agreements are normally multi-year contracts, and generally provide for mutual referrals in their respective markets, generating additional contract and brokerage fees. Through these independently-owned offices, Newmark’s clients have access to additional brokers with local market research capabilities as well as other commercial real estate services in locations where Newmark’s business does not have a physical presence.
 Real Estate Customers and Clients 
 Newmark’s clients include a full range of real estate owners, occupiers, tenants, investors, lenders and multi-national corporations in numerous markets, including office, retail, industrial, multifamily, student housing, hotels, data center, healthcare, self-
 26


storage, land, condominium conversions, subdivisions and special use. Newmark’s clients vary greatly in size and complexity, and include for-profit and non-profit entities, governmental entities and public and private companies. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our former Real Estate Services’ business’ top ten clients, collectively, accounted for approximately 5.3% of our former Real Estate Services business’ total revenue on a consolidated basis, and our largest client accounted for less than 2.0% of our former Real Estate Services business’ total revenue on a consolidated basis.
 Real Estate Services Sales and Marketing
 Newmark seeks to develop its brand and to highlight its expansive platform while reinforcing its position as a leading commercial real estate services firm in the United States through national brand and corporate marketing, local marketing of specific product lines and targeted broker marketing efforts.
Real Estate Services Competition
 Newmark and its subsidiaries compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate industry, including commercial property and corporate facilities management, owner-occupier, property and agency leasing, property sales, valuation, capital markets (equity and debt) solutions, GSE lending and loan servicing and development services. Each business discipline is highly competitive on a local, regional, national and global level. Depending on the geography, property type or service, it competes with other commercial real estate service providers, including outsourcing companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of its real estate management services business and have recently expanded their offerings. These competitors include companies such as Aramark, ISS A/S and ABM Industries. Newmark also competes with in-house corporate real estate departments, developers, institutional lenders, insurance companies, investment banking firms, investment managers and accounting and consulting firms in various parts of its business. Despite recent consolidation, the commercial real estate services industry remains highly fragmented and competitive. Although many of Newmark’s competitors are smaller local or regional firms, some of these competitors are more entrenched on a local or regional basis. Newmark is also subject to competition from other large multi-national firms that have similar service competencies, including CBRE Group, Inc., Jones Lang LaSalle Inc., Cushman & Wakefield plc, Savills Studley, Inc., and Colliers International Group, Inc. In addition, more specialized firms like HFF, Inc., Marcus & Millichap Inc., Eastdil Secured LLC (part of Wells Fargo & Company) and Walker & Dunlop, Inc. compete with Newmark in certain service lines. 
Real Estate Services Seasonality
 Due to the strong desire of many market participants to close real estate transactions prior to the end of a calendar year, Newmark exhibits certain seasonality, with revenue tending to be lowest in the first quarter and strongest in the fourth quarter. For the full year ended 2018, we earned 21% of our Real Estate Services revenues in the first quarter and 31% of our Real Estate Services revenues in the fourth quarter, while the comparable figures were 21% and 29%, respectively, in 2017.
Nasdaq Transaction and Nasdaq Monetization
 On June 28, 2013, we completed the sale (the “Nasdaq Transaction”) of certain assets to Nasdaq, which purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities from us and our affiliates, including the eSpeed brand name and various assets comprising the fully electronic portion of our benchmark on-the-run U.S. Treasury brokerage, market data and co-location service businesses, for cash consideration of $750 million paid at closing, plus an earn-out of up to 14,883,705 shares of Nasdaq common stock to be paid ratably in each of the fifteen years following the closing, provided that Nasdaq produces at least $25 million in gross revenues for the applicable year.  Nasdaq has recorded more than $3.0 billion in gross revenues for each of the last 10 calendar years and generated gross revenues of approximately $4.3 billion in 2018.  As of December 31, 2018, 3,968,988 shares of common stock of Nasdaq have been received by us. The right to receive the remainder of the Nasdaq payment was transferred from us to Newmark prior to the completion of the Newmark IPO and an additional 992,247 shares of common stock of Nasdaq were received by Newmark in 2018.  The shares of Nasdaq that Newmark expects to receive in 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 were monetized in two separate transactions.  See “Item 7. — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Nasdaq Transaction.” Following the transactions, Newmark continues to have the right to receive up to an aggregate of 4,961,235 shares of Nasdaq common stock beginning with the 2023 share earn-out.
BP Transaction Agreement and Real Estate LP Limited Partnership Agreement
 
On September 8, 2017, pursuant to a transaction agreement (which we refer to as the “BP Transaction Agreement”) with Cantor, CCRE, the general partner of CCRE, Real Estate LP and CF Real Estate Holdings GP, LLC, the general partner of Real Estate LP (which we refer to as the “Real Estate LP general partner”), BGC Partners purchased from CCRE all of the outstanding membership interests of Berkeley Point. The total consideration for the acquisition of Berkeley Point was $875 million, subject to certain adjustments. Concurrently with the acquisition of Berkeley Point, (i) BGC Partners invested $100 million of cash in Real Estate LP for approximately 27% of the capital of Real Estate LP, and (ii) Cantor contributed approximately $267 million of cash for approximately 73% of the capital of Real Estate LP. We refer to these transactions, collectively, as the “BP Transaction.” As part of 
 27


the Separation described above, we contributed our interests in Berkeley Point and Real Estate LP to Newmark. Newmark accounted for its minority interest in Real Estate LP as an equity investment, and it is not consolidated in Newmark’s financial statements.
 Berkeley Point Acquisition
 Pursuant to the BP Transaction Agreement, we purchased from CCRE all of the outstanding membership interests of Berkeley Point for a purchase price equal to $875 million, subject to certain adjustments, with $3.2 million of the purchase price paid in units of BGC Holdings (which we refer to as the “Berkeley Point Acquisition”). In accordance with the BP Transaction Agreement, Berkeley Point made a distribution of $69.8 million to CCRE prior to the Berkeley Point Acquisition, for the amount by which Berkeley Point’s net assets exceeded $508.6 million. Cantor is entitled to receive the profits and obligated to bear the losses of the special asset servicing business of Berkeley Point, which represents less than 10% of Berkeley Point’s servicing portfolio and generates an immaterial amount of Berkeley Point’s servicing fee revenue.
 Investment in Real Estate LP
 Concurrently with the Berkeley Point Acquisition, we invested with Cantor in Real Estate LP.  Real Estate LP may conduct activities in any real estate-related business or asset-backed securities-related business or any extensions thereof and ancillary activities thereto. Real Estate LP is operated and managed by Real Estate LP General Partner, which is controlled by Cantor.
 Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Real Estate LP (which we refer to as the “Real Estate LP limited partnership agreement”), Newmark is entitled to a cumulative annual preferred return of five percent of its capital account balance (which we refer to as the “Preferred Return”). After the Preferred Return is allocated, Cantor is then entitled to a cumulative annual preferred return of five percent of its capital account balance. Thereafter, Newmark is entitled to 60% of the gross percentage return on capital of Real Estate LP, multiplied by Newmark’s capital account balance in Real Estate LP (less any amounts previously allocated to BGC Partners or Newmark pursuant to the Preferred Return), with the remainder of the net income of Real Estate LP allocated to Cantor. Cantor will bear initial net losses of Real Estate LP, if any, up to an aggregate amount of approximately $37 million per year. These allocations of net income and net loss are subject to certain adjustments.
 At the option of Newmark, and upon one-year’s written notice to Real Estate LP delivered any time on or after the fourth anniversary of the closing of the BP Transaction, Real Estate LP will redeem in full Newmark’s investment in Real Estate LP in exchange for Newmark’s capital account balance in Real Estate LP as of such time. At the option of Cantor, at any time on or after the fifth anniversary of the closing of the BP Transaction, Real Estate LP will redeem in full Newmark’s investment in Real Estate LP in exchange for Newmark’s capital account balance in Real Estate LP as of such time. At the option of Cantor, at any time prior to the fifth anniversary of the closing of the BP Transaction, Real Estate LP will redeem in full Newmark’s investment in Real Estate LP in exchange for (i) Newmark’s capital account balance in Real Estate LP as of such time plus (ii) the sum of the Preferred Return amounts for any prior taxable periods, less (iii) any net income allocated to BGC Partners or Newmark in any prior taxable periods.
 Additional Terms of the BP Transaction Agreement
 
The BP Transaction Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants, including covenants related to intercompany referral arrangements among Cantor, BGC Partners, Newmark and their respective subsidiaries. These referral arrangements provide for profit-sharing and fee-sharing arrangements at various rates depending on the nature of a particular referral. The parties have further agreed that, subject to limited exceptions, for so long as a member of the BGC group or a member of the Newmark group maintains an investment in Real Estate LP, Real Estate LP and the Cantor group will seek certain government-sponsored and government-funded loan financing exclusively through Berkeley Point.
 Real Estate Services Regulation
 The brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions, property and facilities management, conducting real estate valuation and securing debt for clients, among other business lines, also require that Newmark complies with regulations affecting the real estate industry and maintain licenses in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Like other market participants that operate in numerous jurisdictions and in various business lines, Newmark must comply with numerous regulatory regimes.
 Newmark could be required to pay fines, return commissions, have a license suspended or revoked, or be subject to other adverse action if it conducts regulated activities without a license or violate applicable rules and regulations. Licensing requirements could also impact Newmark’s ability to engage in certain types of transactions, change the way in which it conducts business or affect the cost of conducting business. Newmark and its licensed associates may be subject to various obligations and it could become subject to claims by regulators and/or participants in real estate sales or other services claiming that it did not fulfill its obligations. This could include claims with respect to alleged conflicts of interest where Newmark acts, or are perceived to be acting, for two or more clients. While its management has overseen highly regulated businesses before and expects Newmark to comply with all applicable regulations

in a satisfactory manner, no assurance can be given that it will always be the case. In addition, federal, state and local laws and regulations impose various environmental zoning restrictions, use controls, and disclosure obligations that impact the management, development, use and/or sale of real estate. Such laws and regulations tend to discourage sales and leasing activities, as well as mortgage lending availability, with respect to such properties. In its role as property or facilities manager, Newmark could incur liability under environmental laws for the investigation or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes relating to properties it currently or formerly managed. Such liability may be imposed without regard for the lawfulness of the original disposal activity, or our knowledge of, or fault for, the release or contamination. Further, liability under some of these may be joint and several, meaning that one of multiple liable parties could be responsible for all costs related to a contaminated site. Certain requirements governing the removal or encapsulation of asbestos-containing materials, as well as recently enacted local ordinances obligating property or facilities managers to inspect for and remove lead-based paint in certain buildings, could increase Newmark’s costs of regulatory compliance and potentially subject us to violations or claims by regulatory agencies or others. Additionally, under certain circumstances, failure by Newmark’s brokers acting as agents for a seller or lessor to disclose environmental contamination at a property could result in liability to a buyer or lessee of an affected property.
 Berkeley Point, a subsidiary of Newmark, is required to meet and maintain various eligibility criteria from time to time established by the GSEs and HUD, as well as applicable state and local licensing agencies, to maintain its status as an approved lender. These criteria include minimum net worth, operational liquidity and collateral requirements, and compliance with reporting requirements. Berkeley Point also is required to originate its loans and perform its loan servicing functions in accordance with the applicable program requirements and guidelines from time to time established by the GSEs and HUD.
