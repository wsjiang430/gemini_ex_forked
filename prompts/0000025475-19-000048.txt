CRAWFORD SPECIALTY SOLUTIONS.  The Crawford Specialty Solutions segment accounted for 28.4% of the Company's revenues before reimbursements in 2018.

MATERIAL CUSTOMERS
No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenues in 2018, 2017 or 2016. However, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our Crawford Specialty Solutions segment derived in excess of 10% of its revenue from one customer, and during the year ended December 31, 2016, our Crawford Claims Solutions segment derived more than 10% of its revenue from one customer.
In the event we are not able to retain these significant relationships, or replace any lost revenues from such relationships, revenues and operating earnings within these segments, and possibly for the Company as a whole, could be materially adversely affected.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND TRADEMARKS
The Company's intellectual property portfolio is an important asset which it seeks to expand and protect globally through a combination of trademarks, trade names, copyrights and trade secrets. The Company owns a number of active trademark applications and registrations which expire at various times. As the laws of many countries do not protect intellectual property to the same extent as the laws of the U.S., the Company cannot ensure that it will be able to adequately protect its intellectual property assets outside of the U.S. The failure to protect our intellectual property assets could have a material adverse affect on our business; however, the loss of any single patent, trademark or service mark, taken alone, would not have a material adverse effect on any of our segments or on the Company as a whole.
SERVICE DELIVERY
The Company's claims management services are offered primarily through its global network serving clients in more than 70 countries. Contractor Connection services are offered by providing high-quality outsourced contractor management to national and regional insurance carriers. WeGoLook services are offered through a mobile platform of independent contractors.

COMPETITION
The global claims management services market is highly competitive and comprised of a large number of companies that vary in size and that offer a varied scope of services. The demand from insurance companies and self-insured entities for services provided by independent claims service firms like us is largely dependent on industry-wide claims volumes, which are affected by, among other things, the insurance underwriting cycle, weather-related events, general economic activity, overall employment levels and workplace injury rates. Demand is also impacted by decisions insurance companies and self-insured entities make with respect to the level of claims outsourced to independent claim service firms as opposed to those handled by their own in-house claims adjusters. In addition, our ability to retain clients and maintain or increase case referrals is also dependent in part on our ability to continue to provide high-quality, competitively priced services and effective sales efforts.
We typically earn our revenues on an individual fee-per-claim basis for claims management services we provide to insurance companies and self-insured entities. Accordingly, the volume of claim referrals to us is a key driver of our revenues. Generally, fees are earned over time on cases as services are provided, which generally occurs in the period the case is assigned to us, although sometimes a portion or substantially all of the revenues generated by a specific case assignment will be earned in subsequent periods. We cannot predict the future trend of case volumes for a number of reasons, including the frequency and severity of weather-related cases and the occurrence of natural and man-made disasters, which are a significant source of cases for us and are not subject to accurate forecasting.
The Company competes with a substantial number of smaller local and regional claims management services firms. Many of these smaller firms have rate structures that are lower than the Company's or may, in certain markets, have local knowledge which provides a competitive advantage. We do not believe these smaller firms offer the broad spectrum of claims management services in the range of locations the Company provides and, although such firms may secure business which has a local or regional source, the Company believes its quality product offerings, broader scope of services, and geographically dispersed offices provide us with an overall competitive advantage in securing business from both U.S. and international clients. There are also national and global independent companies that provide a similar broad spectrum of claims management services and who directly compete with the Company.
EMPLOYEES
At December 31, 2018, our total number of full-time equivalent employees ("FTEs") was approximately 9,000. In addition, the Company from time to time, uses the resources of a pool of temporary employees and a network of independent contractors, as and when the demand for services requires. These temporary employees primarily provide catastrophe adjuster services. The Company provides many of its employees with formal classroom training in basic and advanced skills relating to claims administration and healthcare management services. In many cases, employees are required to complete these or other professional courses in order to qualify for promotions. The Company generally considers its relations with its employees to be good.
