ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview and Strategy
 
Anavex Life Sciences Corp. is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development of differentiated therapeutics by applying precision medicine to central nervous system (“CNS”) diseases with high unmet need. We analyze genomic data from clinical studies to identify biomarkers, which we use to select patients that will receive the therapeutic benefit for the treatment of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases.
 
Our lead compound, ANAVEX®2-73, is being developed to treat Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and potentially other central nervous system diseases, including rare diseases, such as Rett syndrome, a rare severe neurological monogenic disorder caused by mutations in the X-linked gene, methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (“MECP2”).
 
Our total portfolio currently consists of five programs. To prioritize the allocation of our resources, we designate certain programs as core programs and others as seed programs. We currently have two core programs and three seed programs. Our core programs are at various stages of clinical and preclinical development, in neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases.
 
The following table summarizes key information about our programs:

Anavex has a portfolio of compounds varying in sigma-1 receptor (S1R) binding activities. The SIGMAR1 gene encodes the S1R protein, which is an intracellular chaperone protein with important roles in cellular communication. S1R is also involved in transcriptional regulation at the nuclear envelope and restores homeostasis and stimulates recovery of cell function when activated. In order to validate the ability of our compounds to activate quantitatively the S1R, we performed, in collaboration with Stanford University, a quantitative Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging scan in mice, which demonstrated a dose-dependent ANAVEX®2-73 target engagement or receptor occupancy (RO) with S1R in the brain.
 


Cellular Homeostasis
 
Many diseases are possibly directly caused by chronic homeostatic imbalances or cellular stress of brain cells. In pediatric diseases like Rett syndrome or infantile spasms, the chronic cellular stress is possibly caused by the presence of a constant genetic mutation. In neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, chronic cellular stress is possibly caused by age-correlated buildup of cellular insult and hence chronic cellular stress. Specifically, defects in homeostasis of protein or ribonucleic acid (“RNA”) lead to the death of neurons and dysfunction of the nervous system. The spreading of protein aggregates resulting in a proteinopathy, a characteristic finding in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases that results from disorders of protein synthesis, trafficking, folding, processing or degradation in cells. The clearance of macromolecules in the brain is particularly susceptible to imbalances that result in aggregation and degeneration in nerve cells. For example, Alzheimer’s disease pathology is characterized by the presence of amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, which are aggregates of hyperphosphorylated Tau protein that are a marker of other diseases known as tauopathies as well as inflammation of microglia. With the SIGMAR1 activation through SIGMAR1 agonists like ANAVEX®2-73, our approach is to restore cellular balance, i.e. homeostasis. Therapies that correct defects in cellular homeostasis might have the potential to halt or delay neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disease progression.

ANAVEX®2-73-specific Biomarkers
 
A full genomic analysis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients treated with ANAVEX®2-73 resulted in the identification of actionable genetic variants. A significant impact of the genomic biomarkers SIGMAR1, the direct target of ANAVEX®2-73 and COMT, a gene involved in memory function, on the drug response level was identified, leading to an early ANAVEX®2-73-specific biomarker hypothesis. It is expected that excluding patients with these two identified biomarker variants (approximately 10%-20% of the population) in prospective studies would identify approximately 80%-90% patients that would display clinically significant improved functional and cognitive scores. The consistency between the identified DNA and RNA data related to ANAVEX®2-73, which are considered independent of AD pathology, as well as multiple endpoints and time-points, provides support for precision medicine clinical development of ANAVEX®2-73 by using genetic biomarkers identified within the study population itself to target patients who are most likely to respond to ANAVEX®2-73 treatment in AD as well as indications like Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD) or Rett syndrome (RTT) in which ANAVEX®2-73 is currently studied.


Clinical Studies Overview
 
Alzheimer’s Disease
 
In November 2016, we completed a Phase 2a clinical trial, consisting of PART A and PART B, which lasted a total of 57 weeks, for ANAVEX®2-73 in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s patients. This open-label randomized trial met both primary and secondary endpoints and was designed to assess the safety and exploratory efficacy of ANAVEX®2-73 in 32 patients. ANAVEX®2-73 targets sigma-1 and muscarinic receptors, which have been shown in preclinical studies to reduce stress levels in the brain believed to restore cellular homeostasis and to reverse the pathological hallmarks observed in Alzheimer’s disease. In October 2017, we presented positive pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data from the Phase 2a study, which established a concentration-effect relationship between ANAVEX®2-73 and study measurements. These measures obtained from all patients who participated in the entire 57 weeks include exploratory cognitive and functional scores as well as biomarker signals of brain activity. Additionally, the study appears to show that ANAVEX®2-73 activity is enhanced by its active metabolite (ANAVEX19-144), which also targets the sigma-1 receptor and has a half-life approximately twice as long as the parent molecule.
 
In March 2016, we received approval from the Ethics Committee in Australia to extend the Phase 2a clinical trial by an additional 108 weeks, which had been requested by patients and their caregivers. Subsequently, in May 2018, we received approval from the Ethics Committee in Australia to further extend the Phase 2a extension trial for an additional two years. The two consecutive trial extensions have allowed participants who completed the 52-week PART B of the study to continue taking ANAVEX®2-73, providing an opportunity to gather extended safety data for a cumulative time period of five years.
 
In October 2018, we presented new long-term clinical data for ANAVEX®2-73 in a presentation at the 2018 Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease (CTAD) Meeting. At 148 weeks into the five-year extended Phase 2a clinical study, data confirmed a significant association between ANAVEX®2-73 concentration and both exploratory functional and cognitive endpoints as measured by the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) evaluation and the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), respectively. The cohort of patients treated with higher ANAVEX®2-73 concentration maintained ADCS-ADL performance compared to the lower concentration cohort (p<0.0001). As well, the patient cohort with the higher ANAVEX®2-73 concentration performed better at MMSE compared to the lower concentration cohort (p<0.0008). A significant impact on the drug response levels of both the SIGMAR1 (p<0.0080) and COMT (p<0.0014) genomic biomarkers, identified and specified at week 57, was also confirmed over the 148-week period. Further, ANAVEX®2-73 demonstrated continued favorable safety and tolerability through 148 weeks.

A larger Phase 2b/3 double-blind, placebo-controlled study of ANAVEX®2-73 in Alzheimer’s disease commenced in August 2018, which is independent of the ongoing Phase 2a extension study. The Phase 2b/3 study will enroll approximately 450 patients for 48 weeks, randomized 1:1:1 to two different ANAVEX®2-73 doses or placebo. The trial is currently taking place in Australia; however, additional regions are being added. The ANAVEX®2-73 Phase 2b/3 study design incorporates genomic precision medicine biomarkers identified in the ANAVEX®2-73 Phase 2a study. Primary and secondary endpoints will assess safety and both cognitive and functional efficacy, measured through Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale – Cognition (ADAS-Cog), ADCS-ADL and Clinical Dementia Rating – Sum of Boxes for cognition and function (CDR-SB).


In October 2019, we initiated a long-term open label extension study, entitled the ATTENTION-AD study, for patients who have completed the 48-week Phase 2b/3 placebo-controlled trial. This study is expected to last two years and will give patients the opportunity to continue their treatment.
 
Rett Syndrome 
 
In February 2016, we presented positive preclinical data for ANAVEX®2-73 in Rett syndrome, a rare neurodevelopmental disease. The study was funded by the International Rett Syndrome Foundation (“Rettsyndrome.org”). In January 2017, we were awarded a financial grant from Rettsyndrome.org of a minimum of $0.6 million to cover some of the costs of a multicenter Phase 2 clinical trial of ANAVEX®2-73 for the treatment of Rett syndrome. This award is being received in quarterly instalments which commenced during fiscal 2018.
 
In March 2019, we commenced the first Phase 2 clinical trial in a planned Rett syndrome program of ANAVEX®2-73 for the treatment of Rett syndrome. The studies will be conducted in a range of patient age demographics and geographic regions.
 
The first Phase 2 study, which commenced in March 2019, is taking place in the United States and is a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and efficacy study of oral liquid ANAVEX®2-73 formulation to treat Rett syndrome. Pharmacokinetic and dose findings will be investigated in a total of 21 patients over a 7-week treatment period including ANAVEX®2-73-specific genomic precision medicine biomarkers. All patients who participate in the study will be eligible to receive ANAVEX®2-73 under a voluntary open label extension protocol. Primary and secondary endpoints include safety as well as Rett syndrome conditions such as cognitive impairment, motor impairment, behavioral symptoms and seizure activity. The ANAVEX®2-73 Phase 2 Rett syndrome study designs incorporate genomic precision medicine biomarkers identified in the ANAVEX®2-73 Phase 2a Alzheimer’s disease study.
 
In June 2019, we commenced the second Phase 2 study of ANAVEX®2-73 for the treatment of Rett syndrome, called the AVATAR study. This study is taking place in Australia using a convenient once-daily oral liquid ANAVEX®2-73 formulation. Similar to the United States-based Phase 2 study for Rett syndrome, the study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of ANAVEX®2-73 in approximately 33 patients over a 7-week treatment period including ANAVEX®2-73 specific precision medicine biomarkers. All patients who participate in the study will be eligible to receive ANAVEX®2-73 under a voluntary open label extension protocol.
 
In September 2019, we announced approval from the Australian Human Research Ethics Committee to commence the third study of ANAVEX®2-73 for the treatment of Rett syndrome, called the EXCELLENCE study. Similar to the AVATAR study, this study is taking place in Australia and is using a convenient once-daily oral liquid ANAVEX®2-73 formulation. The study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of ANAVEX®2-73 in approximately 69 pediatric patients, aged 5 to 18, over a 12-week treatment period incorporating ANAVEX®2-73 specific precision medicine biomarkers. All patients who participate in the study will be eligible to receive ANAVEX®2-73 under a voluntary open label extension protocol.

Parkinson’s Disease
 
In September 2016, we presented positive preclinical data for ANAVEX®2-73 in Parkinson’s disease, which demonstrated significant improvements on all measures: behavioral, histopathological, and neuroinflammatory endpoints. The study was funded by the Michael J. Fox Foundation. Additional data was announced in October 2017 from the model for experimental parkinsonism. The data presented indicates that ANAVEX®2-73 induces robust neurorestoration in experimental parkinsonism. The encouraging results we have gathered in this model, coupled with the favorable profile of this compound in the Alzheimer’s disease trial, support the notion that ANAVEX®2-73 is a promising clinical candidate drug for Parkinson’s disease.
 
In October 2018, we initiated a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial with ANAVEX®2-73 in Parkinson’s Disease Dementia (PDD), which will study the effect of the compound on both the cognitive and motor impairment of Parkinson’s disease. The Phase 2 study will enroll approximately 120 patients for 14 weeks, randomized 1:1:1 to two different ANAVEX®2-73 doses or placebo. The ANAVEX®2-73 Phase 2 PDD study design incorporates genomic precision medicine biomarkers identified in the ANAVEX®2-73 Phase 2a study. The study is currently taking place in Spain and Australia.
 
Our Pipeline
 
Our research and development pipeline includes ANAVEX®2-73 currently in three different clinical studies, and several other compounds in different stages of pre-clinical study.
 
Our proprietary SIGMACEPTOR™ Discovery Platform produced small molecule drug candidates with unique modes of action, based on our understanding of sigma receptors. Sigma receptors may be targets for therapeutics to combat many human diseases, both of neurodegenerative nature, including Alzheimer’s disease, as well as of neurodevelopmental nature, like Rett syndrome. When bound by the appropriate ligands, sigma receptors influence the functioning of multiple biochemical signals that are involved in the pathogenesis (origin or development) of disease.
 
Compounds that have been subjects of our research include the following:
 
ANAVEX®2-73
 
ANAVEX®2-73 may offer a disease-modifying approach in neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases by activation of sigma-1 receptors.
 
In Rett syndrome, administration of ANAVEX®2-73 resulted in both significant and dose related improvements in an array of behavioral paradigms in the MECP2 HET Rett syndrome disease model. In addition, in a further experiment sponsored by Rettsyndrome.org, ANAVEX®2-73 was evaluated in automatic visual response and respiration tests in 7-month old mice, an age at which advanced pathology is evident. Vehicle-treated MECP2 mice demonstrated fewer automatic visual responses than wild-type mice. Treatment with ANAVEX®2-73 for four weeks significantly increased the automatic visual response in the MECP2 Rett syndrome disease mouse. Additionally, chronic oral dosing daily for 6.5 weeks of ANAVEX®2-73 starting at ~5.5 weeks of age was conducted in the MECP2 HET Rett syndrome disease mouse model assessed the different aspects of muscular coordination, balance, motor learning and muscular strengths, some of the core deficits observed in Rett syndrome. Administration of ANAVEX®2-73 resulted in both significant and dose related improvements in an array of these behavioral paradigms in the MECP2 HET Rett syndrome disease model.
 
In March 2019, we commenced the first Phase 2 clinical trial in a planned Rett syndrome program of ANAVEX®2-73 for the treatment of Rett syndrome. The studies will be conducted in a range of patient age demographics and geographic regions, as more fully described above under Clinical Studies Overview – Rett Syndrome.

In May 2016 and June 2016, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation to ANAVEX®2-73 for the treatment of Rett syndrome and infantile spasms, respectively. Further, in November 2019, the FDA granted to ANAVEX®2-73 the Rare Pediatric Disease (RPD) designation for the treatment of Rett syndrome. The RPD designation provides priority review by the FDA to encourage the development of treatments for rare pediatric diseases.
 
For Parkinson’s disease, data demonstrates significant improvements and restoration of function in a disease modifying animal model of Parkinson’s disease. Significant improvements were seen on all measures tested: behavioral, histopathological, and neuroinflammatory endpoints. In July 2018 the Company received approval from the Spanish Agency for Medicinal Products and Medical Devices (AEMPS), to initiate its Phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled 14-week trial of the safety and efficacy of ANAVEX®2-73 for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease dementia. The Phase 2 study commenced in October 2018 and will enroll 120 patients, randomized 1:1:1 to two different ANAVEX®2-73 doses or placebo, in up to 24 clinical study sites across Spain and Australia.
 
In Alzheimer’s disease (AD) animal models, ANAVEX®2-73 has shown pharmacological, histological and behavioral evidence as a potential neuroprotective, anti-amnesic, anti-convulsive and anti-depressive therapeutic agent, due to its potent affinity to sigma-1 receptors and moderate affinities to M1-4 type muscarinic receptors. In addition, ANAVEX®2-73 has shown a potential dual mechanism which may impact both amyloid and tau pathology. In a transgenic AD animal model Tg2576, ANAVEX®2-73 induced a statistically significant neuroprotective effect against the development of oxidative stress in the mouse brain, as well as significantly increased the expression of functional and synaptic plasticity markers that is apparently amyloid-beta independent. It also statistically alleviated the learning and memory deficits developed over time in the animals, regardless of sex, both in terms of spatial working memory and long-term spatial reference memory.
 
Based on the results of pre-clinical testing, we initiated and completed a Phase 1 single ascending dose (SAD) clinical trial of ANAVEX®2-73. In this Phase 1 SAD trial, the maximum tolerated single dose was defined per protocol as 55-60 mg. This dose is above the equivalent dose shown to have positive effects in mouse models of AD. There were no significant changes in laboratory or electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters. ANAVEX®2-73 was well tolerated below the 55-60 mg dose with only mild adverse events in some subjects. Observed adverse events at doses above the maximum tolerated single dose included headache and dizziness, which were moderate in severity and reversible. These side effects are often seen with drugs that target CNS conditions, including AD.
 
The ANAVEX®2-73 Phase 1 SAD trial was conducted as a randomized, placebo-controlled study. Healthy male volunteers between the ages of 18 and 55 received single, ascending oral doses over the course of the trial. Study endpoints included safety and tolerability together with pharmacokinetic parameters. Pharmacokinetics includes the absorption and distribution of a drug, the rate at which a drug enters the blood and the duration of its effect, as well as chemical changes of the substance in the body. This study was conducted in Germany in collaboration with ABX-CRO, a clinical research organization that has conducted several Alzheimer’s disease studies, and the Technical University of Dresden.
 
In December 2014, a Phase 2a clinical trial was initiated for ANAVEX®2-73, for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. The open-label randomized trial was designed to assess the safety and exploratory efficacy of ANAVEX®2-73 in 32 patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease. ANAVEX®2-73 targets sigma-1 and muscarinic receptors, which have been shown in preclinical studies to reduce stress levels in the brain believed to restore cellular homeostasis and to reverse the pathological hallmarks observed in Alzheimer’s disease.

The Phase 2a study met both primary and secondary objectives of the study. The 31-week preliminary exploratory safety and efficacy data from the Phase 2a study of ANAVEX®2-73 in Alzheimer’s patients, with most receiving also donepezil, the current standard of care, demonstrated favorable safety, maximum tolerated dose, positive dose response, sustained efficacy response through 31 weeks for both cognitive and functional measures, as well as positive unexpected therapeutic response events. ANAVEX®2-73 continued to demonstrate a favorable adverse event (AE) profile through 31 weeks in a patient population of elderly Alzheimer’s patients with varying degrees of physical fragility. The most common side effects across all AE categories tended to be of mild severity grade 1 and were resolved with dose reductions that were anticipated within the adaptive design of the study protocol.
 
Through 57 weeks, Alzheimer’s patients taking a daily oral dose between 10mg and 50mg of ANAVEX®2-73 was well tolerated. There were no clinically significant treatment-related adverse events and no serious adverse events. Despite non-optimized dosing of ANAVEX®2-73 throughout the 57-week study, continued significant improvements from baseline of cognitive, functional and behavioral scores in a group of patients were observed, respectively. This data was analyzed using refined mathematical modeling methods in conjunction with the detailed pharmacokinetic (PK) information.
 
In October 2017, we presented positive PK and PD data from the Phase 2a study, which established a concentration-effect relationship between ANAVEX®2-73 and study measurements. These measures, obtained from all patients who participated in the entire 57 weeks, include exploratory cognitive and functional scores as well as biomarker signals of brain activity. Additionally, the study appears to show that ANAVEX®2-73 activity is enhanced by its active metabolite (ANAVEX19-144), which also targets the sigma-1 receptor and has a half-life approximately twice as long as the parent molecule.
 
Pre-specified exploratory analyses included the cognitive (MMSE) and the functional (ADCS-ADL) changes from baseline. A continued stabilization of both cognitive and functional measures in patients treated with ANAVEX®2-73 was observed. This correlation was positive within all measured scores (MMSE, ADCS-ADL, Cogstate, HAM-D and EEG/ERP).
 
In July 2018, we presented the results of a genomic DNA and RNA evaluation of the participants in the Phase 2a study. More than 33,000 genes were analyzed using unbiased, data driven, machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI) system for analyzing DNA & RNA data in patients exposed to ANAVEX®2-73. The analysis identified genetic variants that impacted response to ANAVEX®2-73, among them variants related to the Sigma-1 receptor (SIGMAR1), the target for ANAVEX®2-73. Results showed that study participants without the SIGMAR1 (rs1800866) variants, which is about 80 percent of the population worldwide, demonstrated improved cognitive (MMSE) and the functional (ADCS-ADL) scores. The results from this evaluation may enable a precision medicine approach, since these signatures can now be applied to neurological indications tested in clinical studies with ANAVEX®2-73 including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease dementia and Rett syndrome.
 
ANAVEX®2-73 data presented met prerequisite information in order to progress into a Phase 2b/3 placebo-controlled study. On July 2, 2018, the Human Research Ethics Committee in Australia approved the initiation of our Phase 2b/3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 48-week safety and efficacy trial of ANAVEX®2-73 for the treatment of early Alzheimer’s disease. This Phase 2b/3 study design incorporates inclusion of genomic precision medicine biomarkers identified in the ANAVEX®2-73 Phase 2a study. The Phase 2b/3 study, which is expected to enroll approximately 450 patients, randomized 1:1:1 to either two different ANAVEX®2-73 doses or placebo, commenced in October 2018.
 
Preclinical data also validates ANAVEX®2-73 as a prospective platform drug for other neurodegenerative diseases beyond Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease or Rett syndrome, more specifically, epilepsy, infantile spasms, Fragile X syndrome, Angelman syndrome, multiple sclerosis and, more recently, tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). ANAVEX®2-73 demonstrated significant improvements in all of these indications in the respective preclinical animal models.

In a study sponsored by the Foundation for Angelman Syndrome, ANAVEX®2-73 was assessed in a mouse model for the development of audiogenic seizures. The results indicated that ANAVEX®2-73 administration significantly reduced audiogenic-induced seizures. In a study sponsored by FRAXA Research Foundation regarding Fragile X syndrome, data demonstrated that ANAVEX®2-73 restored hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression to normal levels. BDNF under-expression has been observed in many neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative pathologies. BDNF signaling promotes maturation of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. ANAVEX®2-73 normalization of BDNF expression could be a contributing factor for the positive data observed in both neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders like Angelman and Fragile X syndromes.
 
Preclinical data presented also indicates that ANAVEX®2-73 demonstrates protective effects of mitochondrial enzyme complexes during pathological conditions, which, if impaired, are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases.
 
Preclinical data on ANAVEX®2-73 related to multiple sclerosis indicates that ANAVEX®2-73 may promote remyelination in multiple sclerosis disease. Further, data also demonstrates that ANAVEX®2-73 provides protection for oligodendrocytes (“OL’s”) and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (“OPC’s”), as well as central nervous system neurons in addition to helping repair by increasing OPC proliferation and maturation in tissue culture.
 
In March 2018, we presented preclinical data of ANAVEX®2-73 in a genetic mouse model of tuberous sclerosis complex (“TSC”). TSC is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the growth of numerous benign tumors in many parts of the body with a high incidence of seizures. The new preclinical data demonstrates that treatment with ANAVEX®2-73 significantly increases survival and reduces seizures.
 
ANAVEX®3-71
 
ANAVEX®3-71 is a preclinical drug candidate with a novel mechanism of action via sigma-1 receptor activation and M1 muscarinic allosteric modulation, which has been shown to enhance neuroprotection and cognition in Alzheimer’s disease models. ANAVEX®3-71 is a CNS-penetrable mono-therapy that bridges treatment of both cognitive impairments with disease modifications. It is highly effective in very small doses against the major Alzheimer’s hallmarks in transgenic (3xTg-AD) mice, including cognitive deficits, amyloid and tau pathologies, and also has beneficial effects on inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunctions. ANAVEX®3-71 indicates extensive therapeutic advantages in Alzheimer’s and other protein-aggregation-related diseases given its ability to enhance neuroprotection and cognition via sigma-1 receptor activation and M1 muscarinic allosteric modulation.
 
A preclinical study examined the response of ANAVEX®3-71 in aged transgenic animal models and showed a significant reduction in the rate of cognitive deficit, amyloid beta pathology and inflammation with the administration of ANAVEX 3-71. In April 2016, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation to ANAVEX®3-71 for the treatment of Frontotemporal dementia (FTD).
 
During pathological conditions ANAVEX®3-71 demonstrated the formation of new synapses between neurons (synaptogenesis) without causing an abnormal increase in the number of astrocytes. In neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, synaptogenesis is believed to be impaired. Additional preclinical data presented also indicates that in addition to reducing oxidative stress, ANAVEX®3-71 demonstrates protective effects of mitochondrial enzyme complexes during pathological conditions, which, if impaired, are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases.
 
ANAVEX®1-41
 
ANAVEX®1-41 is a sigma-1 agonist. Pre-clinical tests revealed significant neuroprotective benefits (i.e., protects nerve cells from degeneration or death) through the modulation of endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondrial and oxidative stress, which damages and impairs cell viability. In addition, in animal models, ANAVEX®1-41 prevented the expression of caspase-3, an enzyme that plays a key role in apoptosis (programmed cell death) and loss of cells in the hippocampus, the part of the brain that regulates learning, emotion and memory. These activities involve both muscarinic and sigma-1 receptor systems through a novel mechanism of action.

Preclinical data presented also indicates that ANAVEX®1-41 demonstrates protective effects of mitochondrial enzyme complexes during pathological conditions, which, if impaired, are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases.
 
ANAVEX®1066
 
ANAVEX®1066, a mixed sigma-1/sigma-2 ligand is designed for the potential treatment of neuropathic and visceral pain. ANAVEX®1066 was tested in two preclinical models of neuropathic and visceral pain that have been extensively validated in rats. In the chronic constriction injury model of neuropathic pain, a single oral administration of ANAVEX®1066 dose-dependently restored the nociceptive threshold in the affected paw to normal levels while leaving the contralateral healthy paw unchanged. Efficacy was rapid and remained significant for two hours. In a model of visceral pain, chronic colonic hypersensitivity was induced by injection of an inflammatory agent directly into the colon and a single oral administration of ANAVEX®1066 returned the nociceptive threshold to control levels in a dose-dependent manner. Companion studies in rats demonstrated the lack of any effects on normal gastrointestinal transit with ANAVEX®1066 and a favorable safety profile in a battery of behavioral measures.
 
Our compounds are in the pre-clinical and clinical testing stages of development, and there is no guarantee that the activity demonstrated in pre-clinical models will be shown in human testing.
 
ANAVEX®1037 
 
ANAVEX®1037 is designed for the treatment of prostate and pancreatic cancer. It is a low molecular weight, synthetic compound exhibiting high affinity for sigma-1 receptors at nanomolar levels and moderate affinity for sigma-2 receptors and sodium channels at micromolar levels. In advanced pre-clinical studies, this compound revealed antitumor potential. It has also been shown to selectively kill human cancer cells without affecting normal/healthy cells and also to significantly suppress tumor growth in immune-deficient mice models. Scientific publications highlight the possibility that these ligands may stop tumor growth and induce selective cell death in various tumor cell lines. Sigma receptors are highly expressed in different tumor cell types. Binding by appropriate sigma-1 and/or sigma-2 ligands can induce selective apoptosis. In addition, through tumor cell membrane reorganization and interactions with ion channels, our drug candidates may play an important role in inhibiting the processes of metastasis (spreading of cancer cells from the original site to other parts of the body), angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels) and tumor cell proliferation.
 
We continue to identify and initiate discussions with potential strategic and commercial partners to most effectively advance our programs and realize maximum shareholder value. Further, we may acquire or develop new intellectual property and assign, license, or otherwise transfer our intellectual property to further our goals.
 
Our Target Indications
 
We have developed compounds with potential application to two broad categories and several specific indications. including:
 
Central Nervous System Diseases
 

· | Alzheimer’s disease – In 2019, an estimated 5.8 million Americans were suffering from Alzheimer’s disease. The Alzheimer’s Association® reports that by 2025, 7.2 million Americans will be afflicted by the disease, about a 24 percent increase from currently affected patients. Medications on the market today treat only the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease and do not have the ability to stop its onset or its progression. There is an urgent and unmet need for both a disease modifying cure for Alzheimer’s disease as well as for better symptomatic treatments.

· | Parkinson’s disease – Parkinson’s disease is a progressive disease of the nervous system marked by tremors, muscular rigidity, and slow, imprecise movement. It is associated with degeneration of the basal ganglia of the brain and a deficiency of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Parkinson’s disease afflicts more than 10 million people worldwide, typically middle-aged and elderly people. The Parkinson’s disease market is set to expand to $3.2 billion by 2021, according to business intelligence provider GBI Research.

· | Rett syndrome - Rett syndrome is a rare X-linked genetic neurological and developmental disorder that affects the way the brain develops, including protein transcription, which is altered and as a result leads to severe disruptions in neuronal homeostasis. It is considered a rare, progressive neurodevelopmental disorder and is caused by a single mutation in the MECP2 gene. Because males have a different chromosome combination from females, boys who have the genetic MECP2 mutation are affected in devastating ways. Most of them die before birth or in early infancy. For females who survive infancy, Rett syndrome leads to severe impairments, affecting nearly every aspect of the child’s life; severe mental retardation, their ability to speak, walk and eat, sleeping problems, seizures and even the ability to breathe easily. Rett syndrome affects approximately 1 in every 10,000-15,000 females.

· | Depression - Depression is a major cause of morbidity worldwide according to the World Health Organization. Pharmaceutical treatment for depression is dominated by blockbuster brands, with the leading nine brands accounting for approximately 75% of total sales. However, the dominance of the leading brands is waning, largely due to the effects of patent expiration and generic competition.

· | Epilepsy - Epilepsy is a common chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures. These seizures are transient signs and/or symptoms of abnormal, excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, epilepsy affects 3.4 million Americans. Today, epilepsy is often controlled, but not cured, with medication that is categorized as older traditional anti-epileptic drugs and second generation anti-epileptic drugs. Because epilepsy afflicts sufferers in different ways, there is a need for drugs used in combination with both traditional anti-epileptic drugs and second generation anti-epileptic drugs.

· | Neuropathic Pain – We define neuralgia, or neuropathic pain, as pain that is not related to activation of pain receptor cells in any part of the body. Neuralgia is more difficult to treat than some other types of pain because it does not respond well to normal pain medications. Special medications have become more specific to neuralgia and typically fall under the category of membrane stabilizing drugs or antidepressants.

Cancer
 

· | Malignant Melanoma - Predominantly a skin cancer, malignant melanoma can also occur in melanocytes found in the bowel and the eye. Malignant melanoma accounts for 75% of all deaths associated with skin cancer. The treatment includes surgical removal of the tumor, adjuvant treatment, chemo and immunotherapy, or radiation therapy. According to IMS Health the worldwide malignant melanoma market is expected to grow to $4.4 billion by 2022.

We also own other patent applications directed to enantiomers, formulations and uses that may provide additional protection for one or more of our product candidates.  
 
We regard patents and other intellectual property rights as corporate assets. Accordingly, we attempt to optimize the value of intellectual property in developing our business strategy including the selective development, protection, and exploitation of our intellectual property rights. In addition to filings made with intellectual property authorities, we protect our intellectual property and confidential information by means of carefully considered processes of communication and the sharing of information, and by the use of confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and provisions for the same in contractor’s agreements. While no agreement offers absolute protection, such agreements provide some form of recourse in the event of disclosure, or anticipated disclosure.
 
Our intellectual property position, like that of many biomedical companies, is uncertain and involves complex legal and technical questions for which important legal principles are unresolved. For more information regarding challenges to our existing or future patents, see Item 1A “Risk Factors.”
 
Government Approval
 
Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and foreign countries is a significant factor in the development, manufacture, and expected marketing of our potential drug compounds and in potential future research and development activities. The nature and extent to which such regulation will apply to us will vary depending on the nature of any potential drug compounds developed. We anticipate that all of our potential drug compounds will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization.
 
The process of obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with the appropriate federal statutes and regulations requires substantial time and financial resources. For more information regarding the risks related to obtaining government approvals, see Item 1A “Risk Factors.”
 
The steps ordinarily required before a new drug may be marketed in the United States, which are similar to steps required in most other countries, include:
 

· | non-clinical laboratory tests, non-clinical studies in animals, formulation studies and the submission to the FDA of an IND;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the submission of a new drug application, or NDA, or biologic license application, or BLA, to the FDA; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | FDA review and approval of the New Drug Application (NDA) or biologics license application (BLA).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Non-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of potential drug compound chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal studies. The results of non-clinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. A 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND is required prior to commencement of clinical testing in humans. At any time during the 30-day period or at any time thereafter, the FDA may halt proposed or ongoing clinical trials until the FDA authorizes trials under specified terms. The FDA may require additional animal testing after an initial IND is approved and prior to Phase III trials.
 
Clinical trials to support NDAs are typically conducted in three sequential phases, although the phases may overlap. During Phase I, clinical trials are conducted with a small number of subjects to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacological actions and safety, including side effects associated with increasing doses. Phase II usually involves studies in a limited patient population to assess the efficacy of the drug in specific, targeted indications; assess dosage tolerance and optimal dosage; and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.

If a compound is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase I and II evaluations, Phase III trials are undertaken to further demonstrate clinical efficacy and to further test for safety within an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites.
 
After successful completion of the required clinical trials, a NDA is generally submitted. The FDA may request additional information before accepting the NDA for filing, in which case the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA and responds to the applicant. The FDA’s requests for additional information or clarification often significantly extends the review process. The FDA may refer the NDA to an appropriate advisory committee for review, evaluation, and recommendation as to whether the NDA should be approved, although the FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee.
 
Under the United States Orphan Drug Act, a sponsor may request that the FDA designate a drug intended to treat a “rare disease or condition” as an “orphan drug.” A “rare disease or condition” is one which affects less than 200,000 people in the United States, or which affects more than 200,000 people, but for which the cost of developing and making available the product is not expected to be recovered from sales of the product in the United States. Upon the approval of the first NDA or BLA for a drug designated as an orphan drug for a specified indication, the sponsor of that NDA or BLA is entitled to seven years of exclusive marketing rights in the United States unless the sponsor cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities to meet the needs of persons with the disease. However, orphan drug status is particular to the approved indication and does not prevent another company from seeking approval of an off-patent drug that has other labeled indications that are not under orphan or other exclusivities. Orphan drugs may also be eligible for federal income tax credits for costs associated with the drugs’ development. In order to increase the development and marketing of drugs for rare disorders, regulatory bodies outside the United States have enacted regulations similar to the Orphan Drug Act.
 
Sales outside the United States of potential drug compounds we develop will also be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials and marketing for drugs. The requirements vary widely from country to country, but typically the registration and approval process takes several years and requires significant resources. In most cases, if the FDA has not approved a potential drug compound for sale in the United States, the potential drug compound may be exported for sale outside of the United States, only if it has been approved in any one of the following: the European Union, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Israel, Switzerland and South Africa. There are specific FDA regulations that govern this process.
