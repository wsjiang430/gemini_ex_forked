Overview
Terreno Realty Corporation (“Terreno”, and together with its subsidiaries, “we”, “us”, “our”, “our Company” or “the Company”) acquires, owns and operates industrial real estate in six major coastal U.S. markets: Los Angeles, Northern New Jersey/New York City, San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, Miami, and Washington, D.C. We invest in several types of industrial real estate, including warehouse/distribution (approximately 92.5% of our total portfolio square footage as of December 31, 2018), flex (including light industrial and research and development, or R&D) (approximately 5.4%) and transshipment (approximately 2.1%). We target functional buildings in infill locations that may be shared by multiple tenants and that cater to customer demand within the various submarkets in which we operate. Infill locations are geographic locations surrounded by high concentrations of already developed land and existing buildings. As of December 31, 2018, we owned a total of 205 buildings aggregating approximately 12.8 million square feet that were approximately 98.4% leased to 454 customers, the largest of which accounted for approximately 3.9% of our total annualized base rent, 16 improved land parcels consisting of approximately 55.2 acres and five properties under redevelopment expected to contain approximately 0.7 million square feet upon completion.
We are an internally managed Maryland corporation and elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2010.
Our Investment Strategy
We acquire, own and operate industrial properties in six major coastal U.S. markets: Los Angeles, Northern New Jersey/New York City, San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, Miami, and Washington, D.C.
As described in more detail below, we invest in several types of industrial real estate, including warehouse/distribution, flex (including light industrial and R&D) and transshipment. We target functional buildings in infill locations that may be shared by multiple tenants and that cater to customer demand within the various submarkets in which we operate.
Industrial Facility General Characteristics
Warehouse / distribution (approximately 92.5% of our total portfolio square footage as of December 31, 2018)


• | Single and multiple tenant facilities that typically serve tenants greater than 10,000 square feet of space


• | Generally less than 20% office space


• | Typical clear height from 18 feet to 36 feet


• | May include production/manufacturing areas


• | Interior access via dock high and/or grade level doors


• | Truck court for large and small truck distribution options, possibly including staging for a high volume of truck activity and/or trailer storage

Flex (including light industrial and R&D, approximately 5.4% of our total portfolio square footage as of 
December 31, 2018)


• | Single and multiple tenant facilities that typically serve tenants less than 10,000 square feet of space


• | Facilities generally accommodate both office and warehouse/manufacturing activities


• | Typically has a larger amount of office space and shallower bay depths than warehouse/distribution facilities


• | Parking consistent with increased office use


• | Interior access via grade level and/or dock high doors


• | Staging for moderate truck activity


• | May include a showroom, service center, or assembly/light manufacturing component


• | Enhanced landscaping

2

Transshipment (approximately 2.1% of our total portfolio square footage as of December 31, 2018)


• | Includes truck terminals and other transshipment facilities, which serve both single and multiple tenants


• | Typically has a high number of dock high doors, shallow bay depth and lower clear height


• | Staging for a high volume of truck activity and trailer storage

In addition, we have approximately 55.2 acres of improved land. Such land is used for truck, trailer and container storage and/or car parking. In the future, we may redevelop some or all of such land.
We selected our target markets by drawing upon the experience of our executive management investing and operating in over 50 global industrial markets located in North America, Europe and Asia, the fundamentals of supply and demand, and in anticipation of trends in logistics patterns resulting from population changes, regulatory and physical constraints, changes in technology, e-commerce, potential long term increases in carbon prices and other factors. We believe that our target markets have attractive long-term investment attributes. We target assets with characteristics that include, but are not limited to, the following:


• | Located in high population coastal markets;


• | Close proximity to transportation infrastructure (such as sea ports, airports, highways and railways);


• | Situated in supply-constrained submarkets with barriers to new industrial development, as a result of physical and/or regulatory constraints;


• | Functional and flexible layout that can be modified to accommodate single and multiple tenants;


• | Acquisition price at a discount to the replacement cost of the property;


• | Potential for enhanced return through re-tenanting or operational or physical improvements; and


• | Opportunity for higher and better use of the property over time.

In general, we prefer to utilize local third-party property managers for day-to-day property management. We believe outsourcing property management is cost effective and provides us with operational flexibility and is a source of acquisition opportunities. We may directly manage properties in the future if we determine such direct property management is in our best interest.
We have no current intention to acquire undeveloped or unimproved industrial land or to pursue greenfield ground-up development. However, we may pursue redevelopment, renovation and expansion opportunities of properties that we own, acquire properties and improved land parcels with the intent to redevelop in the near-term, or acquire adjacent land to expand our existing facilities.
We expect that we will continue to acquire the significant majority of our investments as equity interests in individual properties, portfolios of properties or improved industrial land parcels which may be rented without a building in place. We may also acquire industrial properties through the acquisition of other corporations or entities that own industrial real estate. We will opportunistically target investments in debt secured by industrial real estate that would otherwise meet our investment criteria with the intention of ultimately acquiring the underlying real estate. We currently do not intend to target specific percentages of holdings of particular types of industrial properties. This expectation is based upon prevailing market conditions and may change over time in response to different prevailing market conditions.
The properties we acquire may be stabilized (fully leased) or unstabilized (have near term lease expirations or be partially or fully vacant). During the period from February 16, 2010 to December 31, 2018, we have stabilized 69 properties.
We sell properties from time to time when we believe the prospective total return from a property is particularly low relative to its market value or the market value of the property is significantly greater than its estimated replacement cost. Capital from such sales is reinvested into properties that are expected to provide better prospective returns or returned to shareholders. We have disposed of 15 properties since inception in 2010 for an aggregate sales price of approximately $242.5 million and a total gain of approximately $83.7 million.
Competitive Strengths
We believe we distinguish ourselves from our competitors through the following competitive advantages:


• | Focused Investment Strategy. We invest exclusively in six major coastal U.S. markets and focus on infill locations. We selected our six target markets based upon the experience of our executive management investing and operating in over 50 global industrial markets located in North America, Europe and Asia, the fundamentals of supply and demand, and in anticipation of trends in logistics patterns resulting from population changes, regulatory and physical

constraints, changes in technology, e-commerce, potential long term increases in carbon prices and other factors. We have no current intention to acquire undeveloped or unimproved land or pursue greenfield ground-up development, but we may pursue redevelopment, renovation and expansion activities.

• | Highly Aligned Compensation Structure. We believe that executive compensation should be closely aligned with long-term stockholder value creation. As a result, the long-term equity incentive compensation of our executive officers is based primarily on our total shareholder return exceeding the total shareholder return of the MSCI U.S. REIT Index (RMS) or the FTSE National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit”) Equity Industrial Index.


• | Commitment to Strong Corporate Governance. We are committed to strong corporate governance, as demonstrated by the following:


• | all members of our board of directors serve annual terms;


• | we have adopted a majority voting standard in non-contested director elections;


• | we have opted out of three Maryland anti-takeover provisions and, in the future, we may not opt back in to these provisions without stockholder approval;


• | we designed our ownership limits solely to protect our status as a REIT and not for the purpose of serving as an anti-takeover device; and


• | we have no stockholder rights plan. In the future, we will not adopt a stockholder rights plan unless our stockholders approve in advance the adoption of such a plan or, if adopted by our board of directors, we will submit the stockholder rights plan to our stockholders for a ratification vote within 12 months of adoption or the plan will terminate.

Our Financing Strategy
The primary objective of our financing strategy is to maintain financial flexibility with a conservative capital structure using retained cash flows, proceeds from dispositions of properties, long-term debt and the issuance of common and perpetual preferred stock to finance our growth. Over the long term, we intend to:

• | limit the sum of the outstanding principal amount of our consolidated indebtedness and the liquidation preference of any outstanding perpetual preferred stock to less than 35% of our total enterprise value;


• | maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio in excess of 2.0x;


• | maintain a debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio below 6.0x;


• | limit the principal amount of our outstanding floating rate debt to less than 20% of our total consolidated indebtedness; and


• | have staggered debt maturities that are aligned to our expected average lease term (5-7 years), positioning us to re-price parts of our capital structure as our rental rates change with market conditions.

We intend to preserve a flexible capital structure with a long-term goal to maintain our investment grade rating and be in a position to issue additional unsecured debt and additional perpetual preferred stock. Fitch Ratings assigned us an issuer rating of BBB with a stable outlook. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit rating. Our credit rating can affect the amount and type of capital we can access, as well as the terms of any financings we may obtain. In the event our current credit rating is downgraded, it may become difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments. We intend to primarily utilize senior unsecured notes, term loans, credit facilities, dispositions of properties, common stock and perpetual preferred stock. We may also assume debt in connection with property acquisitions which may have a higher loan-to-value.
Our Corporate Structure
We are a Maryland corporation formed on November 6, 2009 and have been publicly held and subject to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, reporting obligations since 2010. We are not structured as an Umbrella Partnership Real Estate Investment Trust, or UPREIT, although we could put in place a similar structure to facilitate an acquisition if needed. We currently own our properties indirectly through subsidiaries and may utilize one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries as appropriate.

Our Tax Status
We elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2010. We believe that our organization and method of operation has enabled and will continue to enable us to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. To maintain REIT status we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we annually distribute at least 90% of our net taxable income to our stockholders, excluding net capital gains. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on REIT taxable income we currently distribute to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to some federal, state and local taxes on our income or property and the income of our taxable REIT subsidiaries, if any, will be subject to taxation at regular corporate rates. We do not currently own any taxable REIT subsidiaries but may in the future.
Competition
We believe the current market for industrial real estate acquisitions to be competitive. We compete for real property investments with pension funds and their advisors, bank and insurance company investment accounts, other public and private real estate investment companies, including other REITs, real estate limited partnerships, owner-users, individuals and other entities engaged in real estate investment activities, some of which have greater financial resources than we do. We believe the leasing of real estate to be highly competitive. We experience competition for customers from owners and managers of competing properties. As a result, we may have to provide free rental periods, incur charges for tenant improvements or offer other inducements, all of which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
Environmental Matters
The industrial properties that we own and will acquire are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws. Under these laws, courts and government agencies have the authority to require us, as owner of a contaminated property, to clean up the property, even if we did not know of or were not responsible for the contamination. These laws also apply to persons who owned a property at the time it became contaminated, and therefore it is possible we could incur these costs even after we sell some of our properties. In addition to the costs of cleanup, environmental contamination can affect the value of a property and, therefore, an owner’s ability to borrow using the property as collateral or to sell the property. Under applicable environmental laws, courts and government agencies also have the authority to require that a person who sent waste to a waste disposal facility, such as a landfill or an incinerator, pay for the clean-up of that facility if it becomes contaminated and threatens human health or the environment.
Furthermore, various court decisions have established that third parties may recover damages for injury caused by property contamination. For instance, a person exposed to asbestos at one of our properties may seek to recover damages if he or she suffers injury from the asbestos. Lastly, some of these environmental laws restrict the use of a property or place conditions on various activities. An example would be laws that require a business using chemicals to manage them carefully and to notify local officials that the chemicals are being used.
We could be responsible for any of the costs discussed above. The costs to clean up a contaminated property, to defend against a claim, or to comply with environmental laws could be material and could adversely affect the funds available for distribution to our stockholders. We generally obtain “Phase I environmental site assessments”, or ESAs, on each property prior to acquiring it. However, these ESAs may not reveal all environmental costs that might have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, results of operations or liquidity and may not identify all potential environmental liabilities.
In general, we utilize local third-party property managers for day-to-day property management and will rely on these third parties to operate our industrial properties in compliance with applicable federal, state and local environmental laws in their daily operation of the respective properties and to promptly notify us of any environmental contaminations or similar issues. As a result, we may become subject to material environmental liabilities of which we are unaware. We can make no assurances that (1) future laws or regulations will not impose material environmental liabilities on us, or (2) the environmental condition of our industrial properties will not be affected by the condition of the properties in the vicinity of our industrial properties (such as the presence of leaking underground storage tanks) or by third parties unrelated to us. We were not aware of any significant or material exposures as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.
Employees
As of February 6, 2019, we have 23 employees. None of our employees is a member of any union.
