ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
History
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 10, 2017 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of RealBiz Media Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“RealBiz”). On October 27, 2017, we, RealBiz, Anshu Bhatnagar and Alex Aliksanyan entered into a Contribution and Spin-Off Agreement, as amended by a First Amendment to Contribution and Spin-Off Agreement dated as of January 29, 2018 (the “Spin-Off Agreement”). Under the Spin-Off Agreement, we and RealBiz agreed, among other things, to use commercially reasonable efforts to effectuate a pro rata distribution of our common stock to RealBiz stockholders. In addition, in furtherance of the separation and distribution described in the Spin-Off Agreement, RealBiz contributed to us certain of its assets and liabilities, including all tangible and intangible assets related to its digital media and marketing services for the real estate industry.
 
On July 31, 2018, RealBiz effectuated our spin-off from RealBiz. Upon completion of the spin-off, RealBiz stockholders owned 100% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. The spin-off was effectuated by way of a pro rata distribution of our common stock to the RealBiz stockholders of record as of July 2, 2018. Each RealBiz stockholder received one share of our common stock for every 900 shares of RealBiz common stock held by such stockholder on the record date. No fractional shares of our common stock were issued. Instead, RealBiz stockholders received a check that represented cash in lieu of fractional shares.
 
The Company
 
We are engaged in the business of providing digital media and marketing services for the real estate industry. We currently generate revenue from service fees (video creation and production and website hosting (ReachFactor)) and product sales (Microvideo app). We were formed through the merging of three divisions: (i) our fully licensed real estate division (formerly known as Webdigs); (ii) our TV media contracts (Home Preview Channel /Extraordinary Vacation Homes) division; and (iii) our Real Estate Virtual Tour and Media group (Realbiz 360). The assets of these divisions were used to create a new suite of real estate products and services that create stickiness through the utilization of video, social media and loyalty programs. At the core of our programs is our proprietary video creation technology which allows for an automated conversion of data (text and pictures of home listings) to a video with voice and music. We provide video search, storage and marketing capabilities on multiple platform dynamics for web and mobile. Once a home, personal or community video is created using our proprietary technology, it can be published to social media, email or distributed to multiple real estate websites.

Products and Services
 
We currently offer the following products and services:
 
Enterprise Video Production: We service some of the largest and well known franchisor accounts in the North America Real Estate Market in compiling listings into a Video format and distributing to those franchisor’s websites, brokers and agents and lead generation platforms 24/7. Some of these multiyear contracts produced over 10 million video listings from 2012-2014. These volumes, however, have declined in 2017 and 2018. We currently have the ability to produce over 15,000 videos per day and have exclusive agreements with key players such as NRT systems.
 
The Virtual Tour (VT) and Microvideo App (MVA): These programs were developed and implemented to allow agents to access specific video based product strategies that are designed specifically to increase the SEO rank and traffic credit to real estate franchise systems and/or their brokers. The MVA is a proprietary video widget marketing application designed to deliver video and integrate SEO strategies, traffic generation, e-mail, lead generation with mobile-friendly viewing. This solution gives those franchises and brokers a much needed tool to lower their cost of prospect acquisition.
 
ReachFactor: Our social media and marketing platform under the “ReachFactor” brand name offers a variety of solutions to agents and brokers such as web design and web hosting.
 
We launched a new real estate platform in the direct to consumer space in October 2018. The new product is designed to enable buyers and sellers of residential real estate to market and sell properties to each other without an agent. This platform is the result of two years of engineering and development work by our engineering team. All work was performed by in house staff and all licenses are owned by us. The new product represents our first foray into the business to consumer space that will attract the great majority of US homeowners. We expect to complete test marketing of the new platform in the first quarter of 2019 upon completion of which we plan to move the platform into full marketing implementation on a nationwide basis.
 
Growth Strategy
 
Key Elements of our growth strategy during fiscal 2019 include:
 
Leverage our proprietary video technology. While our proprietary video technology has been developed for the real estate industry, we believe this technology can be applied to other industries as well. In particular, we believe that the used car sale industry could benefit from our automated and seamless development engine. We will continue to explore these and other similar opportunities.

Design and develop technology for the real estate industry. We will continue working to develop technologies to increase sales and efficiencies for the real estate professional. We are in the preliminary stages of creating a new website to enter into the business-to-consumer segment of the real estate industry. In October 2018, we launched a new real estate platform in the direct to consumer space to enable buyers and sellers of residential real estate to market and sell properties to each other without an agent.
 
Background and Industry Trends
 
We believe that the real estate market is undergoing a dramatic change not dissimilar to that previously experienced by traditional stock brokerages. We believe that the most critical aspect driving this change is the advent of the Internet as a tool for searching for and researching real estate, eliminating the commitments of time and expense involved with visiting multiple properties in person. According to the National Association of Realtors’ 2014 “Member Profile,” 89% of home buyers use the internet to search for a home, up from 74% in 2010. This mirrors the 69% who use a realtor for their search. Note: many buyers use both the internet and a realtor in their search. In addition, home sellers can use the Internet to check home valuations, track the housing market and research comparable sales information. The majority of consumers used the Internet frequently to search for homes (81%), with consumers aged 33 or younger being higher than average (92%) and 59-67 year olds below (although still high at 69%). Searches are often conducted on mobile devices such as iPhones (47%), iPads (40%) or Androids (24%). One of the most significant trends for our business is that 70% of homebuyers search for and watch video home tours. Also, real estate searches on Google have grown 253% over the past four years.
 
The increased use of technology throughout the entire process of a typical residential real estate transaction is an important development in the real estate market. For instance, electronic communication and electronic data storage permits a real estate brokerage to quickly reproduce standard real estate transaction documents, store such documents and store other important information about customers and properties, and communicate quickly with other parties involved in real estate transactions (e.g., title companies, insurers, surveyors, inspectors and governmental agencies), all of which permits increased efficiencies in the process of buying and selling a home. The technological changes and developments generally make it possible to effect a greater volume of transactions with less effort and expense.
 
We believe the technological developments in the real estate market and the increased amount of information available to and used by ordinary consumers appear to be circumstances that are similar to those developments that eventually gave rise to the non-traditional stock brokerages which have intruded upon the market dominance of traditional stock brokerages over the past two decades. For example, we note that the non-traditional stock brokerages developed their services and products to compete primarily on the bases of price, consumer effort and technology. Their websites, such as TD Ameritrade or e-Trade, provide not only trading capacity for the average consumer, but also a tremendous amount of information about companies. In this regard, we note that there has recently been a proliferation of various Internet-related real estate businesses that seek to provide either specific and limited services or information relating to residential real estate transactions (e.g., ForSaleByOwner.com, BuyOwner.com, Realtor.com, Trulia.com and Zillow.com). Like the non-traditional stock brokerages, these businesses typically rely on consumer effort, technology and price as the bases for competition.
 
However, the market models of Zillow/Trulia and Realtor are now in direct conflict with the enterprises that own the listings and that make the actual sales. The Zillow group’s main revenues are generated by advertising the listing as though another agent owned the listing, an agent that had paid Zillow for such display. Unaware, the consumer thus interacts with the displayed agent thinking they are the one that controls the listing. Then the display agent contacts the true agent and askes to 50/50 split the commission due on the sale. As the consumer power of the Zillow group has grown exponentially, they have substantially cut into the profits of the enterprises and agents that actually own the listings. Thus the battle lines are now drawn between the Zillow group and groups such as Realogy member of companies and Keller Williams.

We foresee direct and continuous pushback in 2019 by the enterprises against the Zillow group, in trying to neutralize their marketing power and take ownership back of their listings. As publicly owned companies the Zillow group can only grow revenues by increasing advertising rates to the agent community which strikes deep into agent discontent with the enterprises and the resulting demand in action. This competitive model is unique to the real estate industry and clearly will not follow the path of the aforementioned financial portals.
 
Website and Mobile Applications
 
We are utilizing our proprietary technology along with our industry contracts to create two separate and very important critical paths for real estate professionals and their organizations to follow. By using our video processing capabilities combined with micro-site and website building techniques we have created an agent/broker micro-site product that leverages best practices in SEO (search engine optimization) on the agent/brokers behalf and delivers a web and mobile friendly rich media experience to consumers. This solution provides the broker a significant increase in organic ranking in local searches, increased site traffic and by doing so, reduces the agent/broker dependency on traditional listing aggregators. Secondly, by integrating marketing capabilities into a single powerful platform, we have entered the direct to agent sales model through Nestbuilder Agent 2.0, our proprietary marketing toolset. This strategy lowers risk threshold by distributing revenues throughout 1,200,000 registered agents in the US as well as providing a pathway to developing accelerating revenue stream via a monthly subscription model. While the former video generator intensive model for us will continue to be our primary revenue generator, we believe that our Nestbuilder Agent 2.0 will become the next generation of marketing for the real estate industry.
Market and Competition
 
The National Association of Realtors has approximately 1.2 million members, of which we estimate roughly half are active and associated with at least one real estate brokerage firm.
 
Presently, Zillow is the largest independent real estate market site, as measured by homes in its database and unique visitors to its website. In 2015, Zillow completed its acquisition of Trulia making it the single most powerful name in the real estate web marketplace. A full 29% of web property searches were conducted on the joint platforms in 2015. As part of the industry consolidation, NewsCorp recently acquired the 3rd largest real estate portal, Realtor.com. Additionally there are a variety of other websites which have meaningful market share and listing information. We believe a battle for the consumer mindset is now underway as the real estate enterprises enter into a competitive setting against Zillow/Trulia/Realtor/Homes. We also believe we can benefit from the acrimony as we have positioned ourselves as the friends of the enterprises and offer products and capabilities that will enhance the position of the enterprises by leveraging our technology.

Customers
 
We have experienced substantial customer losses in our legacy businesses due to our proprietary Virtual Tour technology being overtaken by open source coding and clients taking the service in house and offering as an added benefit to agents, free of charge. As a result, in 2018, our legacy business revenue was down 32%.
Industry Segments
 
We currently operate in one primary operating segment, real estate, mainly through web-assisted services.
 
Seasonality of Business
 
The residential real estate market has traditionally experienced seasonality, with a peak in the spring and summer seasons and a decrease in activity during the fall and winter seasons. Revenues in each quarter can be significantly affected by activity during the prior quarter, given the time lag between contract execution and closing. A typical real estate transaction has a 30 day lag between contract signing and closing of the transaction.
Environmental Regulation
 
We are not subject to environmental regulations that have a material effect upon our capital expenditures or otherwise.
 
Other Regulation
 
We are subject to governmental regulation by federal, state and local regulatory authorities with respect to our operations. We operate several Internet websites that we use to distribute information about and provide our services and content. Internet services are now subject to regulation in the United States relating to the privacy and security of personally identifiable user information and acquisition of personal information from children under the age of 13, including the federal Child Online Protection Act (COPA) and the federal Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (CAN-SPAM). In addition, a majority of states have enacted laws that impose data security and security breach obligations. Additional federal and state laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the Internet or other online services, covering such issues as user privacy, child safety, data security, advertising, pricing, content, copyrights and trademarks, access by persons with disabilities, distribution, taxation and characteristics and quality of products and services. In addition, to the extent we offer products and services to online consumers outside the United States, the laws and regulations of foreign jurisdictions, including, without limitation, consumer protection, privacy, advertising, data retention, intellectual property, and content limitations, may impose additional compliance obligations on us.
Intellectual Property
 
We have been granted perpetual licenses of patents which the Company uses for imaging and streaming tiled images as well as 3D image and warping technologies.
 
Employees
 
The Company currently has 2 full-time employees.
