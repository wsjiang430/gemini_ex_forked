Item 1. Business
​
We are a leading diversified metal solutions provider and the largest metals service center company in North America (U.S. and Canada) based on revenues, with 2022 net sales of $17.03 billion. 
​
We have been in business over 80 years since our original organization on February 3, 1939, operating a single metals service center in Los Angeles, California fabricating steel reinforcing bar. We reincorporated in the State of Delaware in 2015. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “RS” and was first traded on September 16, 1994.
​
We believe we have a unique and sustainable business model predicated on the following key attributes:
​

● | Diversity of Products, Customers and Services
--+----------------------------------------------

We operate through a network of approximately 315 locations in 40 U.S. states and in 12 foreign countries. We distribute a full line of over 100,000 metal products, including alloy, aluminum, brass, copper, carbon steel, stainless steel, titanium and specialty steel products.
​
We have more than 125,000 customers in a variety of industries, including general manufacturing, non-residential construction (including infrastructure), transportation (rail, truck trailer and shipbuilding), aerospace (commercial; military, defense and space), energy (oil and natural gas), electronics and semiconductor fabrication, and heavy industry (agricultural, construction and mining equipment). We also service the auto industry, primarily through our toll processing operations where we process the metal for a fee, without taking ownership of the metal.
​
Our diversification by product, end market and geography helps mitigate volatility in metals pricing and changing end market conditions. We are not dependent on any particular customer or industry because we process and distribute a variety of metals. This diversity of product type and material reduces our exposure to fluctuations or other weaknesses in the financial stability of particular customers or industries. We are also less dependent on any particular suppliers as a result of our product diversification. As a result, we have remained profitable every year, even during recessionary periods and a global pandemic, since our initial public offering in 1994.
​

● | Customer Relationships
--+-----------------------

We believe that our focus on servicing customers with small order sizes and quick turnaround, along with our growth and diversification strategy, has been instrumental in our ability to produce industry-leading operating results among publicly traded metals service center companies in North America. In 2022, approximately 97% of our orders were from repeat customers and we delivered approximately 40% of our orders within 24 hours of the customer placing the order with us. 
​

● | Value-Added Solutions Provider
--+-------------------------------

We provide a wide variety of processing services to meet our customers’ specifications and deliver products to fabricators, manufacturers and other end users. We believe that few other metals service centers offer the broad range of processing services and metals that we provide. Our primary processing services range from cutting, leveling or sawing to more complex processes such as machining or electropolishing. We generally only process specific metals to non-standard sizes pursuant to customer purchase order specifications. In addition, we typically acquire standard size and grade products that can be processed into many different sizes to meet the needs of many different customers. 
​
We have increased the amount of value-added processing services we provide through recent acquisitions and significant investments in new equipment over the past several years. Expanding our value-added capabilities (including toll processing) and increasing the percentage of our total sales represented by the higher margin orders generated from those capabilities, helps reduce the volatility in our profitability ratios during periods of unfavorable metals demand and/or pricing. 
​
​

● | Industry leader
--+----------------

According to the Metals Service Center Institute (“MSCI”) reporting of industry tons sold in the U.S., our 2022 tons sold from our U.S. locations represented approximately 14.5% of the total tons sold by the U.S. metals service center industry. Metals service centers are the largest single customer group for the North America primary metals producers (“mills”) in the broader metals wholesale industry with estimated sales of approximately $219 billion according to IBISWorld Inc.’s July 2022 report, a global intelligence publication. We believe our relatively low level of market share shown by MSCI leaves significant opportunity for further strategic growth within the industry.
​

● | Pricing Power
--+--------------

We primarily operate in the spot market for both the purchase and sale of our products. As a limited portion of our business is dependent on long-term contractual commitments, we have the ability to quickly pass on raw material price increases to our customers and maintain consistency in our gross profit margin. 
​

● | Purchasing Power
--+-----------------

We believe we are one of the largest customers of the North American mills. We believe that our significant scale and relationships with suppliers enable significant purchasing power and product availability in all market conditions.
​
Our business is relationship-based and we operate under the following trade names:

We have one operating and reportable segment—metals service centers. Further information about our reportable segment, including geographic information, appears in Note 18—“Segment information” to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
​
Industry Overview
​
Metals service centers acquire carbon steel, aluminum, stainless and alloy steel and other metal products from mills, and then process and distribute these materials to meet customer specifications.
​

4



Customers purchase from metals service centers for a variety of reasons, including the ability to obtain value-added metals processing, readily available inventory, reliable and timely delivery, flexible minimum order size, and quality control. Many customers deal exclusively with service centers because the quantities of metal products that they purchase are smaller than the minimum order sizes specified by mills or because those customers require intermittent deliveries over long or irregular periods. Metals service centers respond to a niche market created because of the focus on when-needed inventory management and materials management outsourcing in the capital goods and related industries. In general, metals service center customers have placed increased emphasis on carrying lower amounts of inventory, especially during declining price environments. 
​
The processing services we provide save our customers time, labor, and expense, reducing their overall manufacturing costs. Specialized metals processing equipment requires high utilization to be cost effective. We believe many manufacturers and their suppliers are not able or willing to invest in the necessary technology, equipment, and warehousing of inventory to perform efficient and effective metal processing themselves for their own operations. Accordingly, we believe industry dynamics have created a niche in the market for metals service centers. Metals service centers purchase, process, and deliver metals to end-users in a more efficient and cost-effective manner than the end-user could achieve by dealing directly with the primary producer. The metals service centers of the MSCI comprise the largest customer group for North American mills, buying and reselling almost 50% of all the carbon, alloy, stainless and specialty steels, aluminum, copper, brass, bronze and superalloys produced in the United States according to a July 2022 report on the metals wholesaling industry issued by IBISWorld Inc., a global intelligence publication. 
​
According to IBISWorld Inc.’s July 2022 report, the United States metals wholesale industry (comprised of metals service centers of the MSCI and other metal wholesaling distributors) revenues were expected to grow approximately 15% from $191 billion in 2021 to approximately $219 billion in 2022, primarily due to increases in metal prices. IBISWorld Inc. expects the largest industry participants to represent less than 10% of the estimated $219 billion industry total in 2022. Our 2022 U.S. revenues of approximately $16 billion represented about 7% of the entire U.S. metals wholesaling market based on IBISWorld Inc.’s estimated 2022 industry revenues. However, the measurement of our market share based on the shipment levels of the metals service center industry published by the MSCI, who does not also publish estimated industry revenues, was at 14.5%, which we believe is due to the inclusion of non-metal service center companies in the broader metals wholesaling industry as defined by IBISWorld Inc. Regardless of the measurement of our market share through our tons sold via MSCI industry shipments or our sales relative to what we believe to be the broader metals wholesaling industry, our relatively low market share provides us significant opportunity for growth.
​
We believe that metals service centers are generally less susceptible to market cycles than metals producers because service centers are generally able to pass on all or a portion of increases in metal costs to their customers. As we have a limited long-term contractual business and focus on rapid inventory turnover, we believe that we are generally less vulnerable to changing metals prices than metals producers. However, fluctuations in metals pricing have a significant impact on our revenue and profit.
​
Operational Strategy
​
Our primary business strategy is to provide the highest levels of quality and service to our customers in the safest, most efficient operational manner, allowing us to maximize our financial results. The core tenets of our differentiated approach include:
​

● | Our commitment to safety which is our top priority and an important element of our culture and day-to-day operational focus. Our executive team supports a safety management system that includes policies, standard practices and goals at our facilities. In addition, our safety professionals monitor compliance with regulatory requirements and conduct safety assessments and training to improve safety practices.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Organic growth and innovation through our industry-leading investments in state-of-the-art value-added processing equipment to better service our customers. We have made significant investments in our businesses in recent years, including investments in advanced, state-of-the-art value-added processing equipment.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | We believe our diversification of products, end markets and geography reduces volatility. We maintain a wide variety of products in inventory and believe this differentiates us from all other North American service center companies. Our product mix has become more diverse mainly as a result of our targeted growth strategy that includes acquiring companies that distribute mainly specialty products and provide increased levels of value-added processing services.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Our decentralized operating structure puts decision making and resources close to the customer. Due to our focus on small orders, our decentralized operating structure and the diversity of the markets we serve, customer concentrations are not significant.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | A focus on when-needed inventory management and small orders with quick turnaround and increasing levels of value-added processing which generate higher profit margins as compared to a focus on large volume orders. We seek to increase profitability through our customer service, operational efficiencies, pricing discipline, innovation and inventory management as well as by providing increased levels of value-added processing. Approximately 40% of our orders were delivered within 24 hours from receipt of the order. We believe that this provides a competitive advantage to us, and, for the remainder of our orders we typically have shorter lead times than our competitors given our decentralized structure and investments in processing equipment.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Strong pricing discipline by our managers in the field allows us to appropriately price the value provided to customers. We believe our focus on maintaining pricing discipline related to our processing services coupled with our investments in state-of-the-art equipment and advanced technology were significant contributors to the substantial increases in gross profit margin over the past several years.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Minimal contractual sales help us effectively manage working capital and minimize the impact of changing metal prices.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Growth Strategy 
​
Our growth strategy is based on increasing our operating results through organic growth activities and strategic acquisitions that enhance our product, customer and geographic diversification. We believe our focused growth strategy and increasing the level of value-added services we provide our customers makes us less vulnerable to regional or industry-specific economic volatility and somewhat lessens the negative impact of volatility experienced in commodity pricing and cyclicality of our customer end markets, as well as general economic trends.
​
We expect to continue growing our business through acquisitions and internal growth initiatives, particularly those that diversify our products, customer base and geographic locations and increase our sales of high-margin specialty products and value-added processing services.
​
Sales and Marketing
​
Sales personnel are organized by division or subsidiary and are divided into two groups. Outside sales personnel travel throughout a specified geographic territory and maintain relationships with our existing customers and develop new customers. Inside sales personnel remain at the facilities to price and write orders. Outside sales personnel generally receive incentive compensation based on the gross profit from their particular geographic territories. Inside sales personnel generally receive incentive compensation based on the gross profit and/or pretax income of their particular location. 
​
We acquire well-run businesses with strong customer relationships and solid reputations within the marketplace. Because of this, we find value in the acquired trade name and continue to use the business name and maintain the customer relationships.
​
Customers
​
Although we sell directly to many large original equipment manufacturer customers, the majority of our sales are to small machine shops and fabricators, in small quantities with frequent deliveries, helping them manage their working 

6



capital and credit needs more efficiently. Our metals service centers wrote and delivered over 4.6 million orders during 2022 or an average of 18,460 per day, with an average price of approximately $3,670 per order. Most of our metals service center customers are located within a 200-mile radius of the Reliance metals service center serving them. The proximity of our service centers to our customers helps reduce total road miles and carbon emissions, promote efficient routing and provide quick delivery. With our fleet of approximately 1,720 trucks (some of which are leased), we are able to service many smaller customers and provide quick turnaround deliveries. We believe that maintaining our own fleet of trucks and drivers provides a competitive advantage as there has been a shortage of qualified drivers and third-party freight costs have been at elevated levels in recent years. Moreover, our order entry systems and flexible production scheduling enable us to meet customer requirements for short lead times and quick delivery, when needed. In 2022, approximately 97% of our orders were from repeat customers. We believe that our long-term relationships with many of our customers significantly contribute to the success of our business. Providing prompt and efficient services and quality products at reasonable prices are important factors in maintaining and expanding these relationships.
​
We have built and opened international locations in recent years to service specific industries, typically making limited investments to support existing key U.S. customers that also operate in those international markets. Accordingly, our exposure to risks associated with such investments is minimal. Sales from our foreign operations were 6% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022, or $1.05 billion. However sales to international customers (based on the shipping destination) were approximately 8% of our consolidated 2022 net sales, or $1.37 billion, with approximately 29%, or $398.0 million, to Canadian customers.
​
Customer demand changes from time to time based on, among other things, general economic conditions and industry capacity. Many of the industries in which our customers compete are cyclical in nature. Because we sell to a wide variety of customers in a wide variety of industries, we believe that we are able to somewhat mitigate earnings volatility. In addition, many of our customers are small job shops and fabricators who also have a diverse customer base and the versatility to service different end markets when an existing market slows. 
​
Due to our focus on small orders, decentralized operating structure and the diversity of the markets we serve, customer concentrations are not significant. Our largest customer represented only 1.2% of our net sales in 2022. In 2022, we generated sales greater than $25 million from only 44 customers.
​
Suppliers
​
We primarily purchase our inventory from the major metals producers in North America. Our U.S. operations do, however, also purchase minimal amounts of certain products from foreign producers. We have multiple suppliers for all of our products. 
​
Because of our total volume of purchases and our long-term relationships with our suppliers, we believe that we are generally able to purchase inventory at the most competitive prices offered by our suppliers. We believe that these relationships provide us with an advantage in sourcing product to be available for our customers in accelerated timeframes when needed, and also allow us to more efficiently manage our inventory. We believe both our size and our long-term relationships with our suppliers continue to be important because mill consolidation has reduced the number of suppliers.
​
Seasonality
​
Some of our customers are in seasonal businesses, especially customers in the construction industry and related businesses. Our overall operations have not shown any material seasonal trends as a result of our geographic, product and customer diversity. Typically, revenues in the months of July, November and December have been lower than in other months because of a reduced number of working days for shipments of our products, resulting from holidays observed by the Company as well as vacation and extended holiday closures at some of our customers. The number of shipping days in each quarter also has an impact on our quarterly sales and profitability. Results of any one or more quarters are therefore not necessarily indicative of annual results.
​
​

7



Competition
​
The metals service center industry is highly fragmented and competitive within localized areas or regions. Many of our competitors operate single, stand-alone service centers. According to IBISWorld Inc., there were approximately 11,200 metal wholesaling locations operated by approximately 8,800 companies in the United States in 2022. Our 2022 tons sold from our U.S. locations represented approximately 14.5% of the total tons sold by the U.S. metals service center industry according to MSCI reporting. The significant number of metals service centers that exist in this fragmented market creates opportunities for us to expand by making acquisitions. 
​
We have numerous competitors in each of our product lines and geographic locations, and competition is most frequently local or regional. Our domestic service center competitors are generally smaller than we are, but we also face strong competition from national, regional and local independent metals distributors and the producers themselves, some of which have greater resources than we do. 
​
We compete with other companies on price, service, quality, processing capability and availability of products and services. We maintain relationships with our major suppliers at the executive and local levels. We believe that this division of responsibility has increased our ability to obtain competitive prices of metals by leveraging our total size and to provide more responsive service to our customers by allowing our local management teams to make the purchasing decisions. In addition, we believe that the size of our inventory, the diversity of metals products we have available, and the wide variety of processing services we provide distinguish us from our competition. We believe our competitors are generally unable to offer the same high-quality products and services we provide using state-of-the-art equipment and advanced technology as they do not have the financial ability or risk tolerance to grow their businesses at the same rate as Reliance. We believe our industry-leading financial results in recent years were due to our strong financial condition, the high quality of products and services we are able to offer as a result of our significant investments in our acquired businesses, facilities and equipment, as well as our continued focus on small order sizes with quick turnaround.
​
Human Capital
​
At December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 14,500 persons worldwide, of which approximately 12,800 were employed in the United States. Our total workforce of approximately 15,000 persons at December 31, 2022 includes approximately 500 contract and temporary workers. 
​
As of December 31, 2022, approximately 13% of our employees were represented by unions under collective bargaining agreements. We have entered into collective bargaining agreements with 42 union locals at 52 of our locations. These collective bargaining agreements have not had a material impact on our revenues or profitability. From time to time, our collective bargaining agreements expire and come up for renegotiation. Approximately 500 employees are covered by 23 different collective bargaining agreements that expire in 2023. 
​
As a result of a materiality assessment, we determined that Reliance’s most significant social issues are: (i) the health and safety of our colleagues; and (ii) human capital management. We seek to create an environment that values the health, safety and wellbeing of our employees, their families and the communities in which we live and do business. We strive to equip our employees with the knowledge, skills and resources to maintain or improve their personal health, develop professionally and operate safely within our businesses. A highlight of our commitment to our employees is the inclusion of “People” as one of our six core values that represent key areas of focus for our company. For more information on the Company’s core values, see the Company’s Code of Conduct available at investor.rsac.com. Among the critical elements included in the People category are the following:
​

● | Focus on Safety
--+----------------

The health and safety of our employees, customers, suppliers and communities is our most important core value. Our safety programs are designed around recognized standards with appropriate variations addressing the multiple jurisdictions and regulations, specific hazards and unique working environments of our operations. Our SMART Safety program focuses on embedding our culture of safety across all of our operations. We strive to have zero fatalities and no life-threatening or life-altering injuries and illnesses from working at our facilities. 
​

8



Our executive team supports a safety management system that includes policies, standard practices and goals at our facilities, including:
​

o | conducting regular safety assessments;
--+---------------------------------------

​

o | monitoring best practices and compliance with regulatory requirements;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

​

o | training our employees to improve safety practices;
--+----------------------------------------------------

​

o | integrating video-based technology and safety programs into substantially all Company-operated trucks; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

o | maintaining emergency preparedness and response plans.
--+-------------------------------------------------------

​
The Company utilizes a mixture of indicators to assess the health and safety performance of its domestic operations. Lagging indicators include the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (“OSHA”) Total Recordable Incident Rate (“TRIR”) and average Department of Transportation Recordable Accident Rate per million miles (“DOT Rate”). 
​

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ 
------------------+------+-------------------------+---+------+------+---+------+-----
​ | ​ | Year Ended December 31,
​ | 2022 | ​ | ​ | 2021 | ​ | ​ | 2020
Safety Indicator: | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ 
TRIR | ​ | 1.61 | ​ | ​ | 2.12 | ​ | ​ | 1.86
DOT Rate | ​ | 0.55 | ​ | ​ | 0.54 | ​ | ​ | 0.60

​
Our focus on safety is evident in our 2022 TRIR being our lowest ever and lower than 3.5, as reported in the most recent Metals Service Center Institute survey performed in 2020. A lower TRIR means that fewer people are injured, and fewer lives are negatively impacted. We have not identified a universally accepted and annually updated benchmarking standard for DOT Rate.
​

● | Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
--+--------------------------------

We believe that superior Company performance requires contributions from a diverse workforce that includes a variety of employee experiences, backgrounds, and characteristics. We are committed to providing fair and unbiased opportunities and hiring, developing and supporting a diverse and inclusive workplace. Our commitment to diversity and inclusion is also reinforced by our Code of Conduct, which prohibits employment discrimination or harassment based on race, color, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions), national origin, religion, age, disability, genetic information, veteran status, sexual orientation, marital status, or any other characteristic protected by applicable law. 
​

● | Employee Health, Wellness and Wellbeing
--+----------------------------------------

The health, wellness and wellbeing of our employees is critical to our success. We are committed to providing our employees with resources to help them achieve their personal health, wellness, and wellbeing goals. As part of our comprehensive benefits offering, we provide employees and their covered spouses/domestic partners with a robust employee assistance program, individualized assessments, access to lab or on-site health screenings and personalized wellness coaching. Our customizable program integrates web-based tools, phone and mail-based communications, local activities and is designed to support the diverse and individualized needs of our employees in order to help them improve or maintain their health status and ongoing engagement in healthy behaviors. 
​

● | Compensation and Benefits
--+--------------------------

To help attract and retain the best employees, we strive to offer competitive compensation and best-in-class benefits. In addition to base salaries, our compensation programs can include annual bonuses, stock-based compensation awards, a 401(k) plan with employee matching opportunities, healthcare insurance and welfare benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts. We believe that we provide industry-leading healthcare 

9



benefits to our employees and fund approximately 86% of the costs associated with our U.S. employees’ health insurance coverage.
​

● | Community Service
--+------------------

Reliance is committed to investing in and enriching the communities in which we live and work. Giving back to those in need and enriching people's lives is a deep-rooted philosophy ingrained in our corporate culture primarily through our support of non-profit organizations that provide active duty, veterans, transitioning service members and their families with advanced manufacturing training and other support services. Our dedication to each and every member of our Family of Companies is the foundation for “Reliance Cares,” our emergency assistance fund dedicated to supporting employees impacted by natural disasters. Through employee funded contributions, matched dollar-for-dollar by Reliance, we have been able to provide approximately 1,000 grants to employees (including approximately 170 grants to support employees and their families responding to COVID-19 related personal impacts) since the inception of Reliance Cares in 2017.
 ​

● | Employee Development
--+---------------------

We believe employees should have an opportunity for ongoing development through challenging daily contributions and structured development programs. We launched an annual evolving leaders program focused on the continued training of selected employees, encouraging the development in several areas of our business, leadership and communication, along with opportunities for enterprise-wide collaboration to drive an approach to innovative problem solving and solutions. We continue to expand our talent management initiatives to pursue the significant long-term potential for our continued success. Our success is dependent on the knowledge, skills and abilities of our current and future leaders.

Quality Control
​
Procuring high-quality metal from suppliers on a consistent basis is critical to our business. We maintain strict quality control measures to assure that the quality of purchased raw materials will enable us to meet our customers’ specifications and to reduce the costs of production interruptions. In certain instances, we perform physical and chemical analyses on selected raw materials, typically through a third-party testing lab, to verify that mechanical and dimensional properties, cleanliness and surface characteristics meet our requirements and our customers’ specifications. We also conduct certain analyses of surface characteristics on selected processed metal before delivery to the customer. We believe that maintaining high standards for accepting metals ultimately results in reduced return rates from our customers.
​
We maintain various quality certifications throughout our operations. Approximately 50% of our operating locations have earned International Organization for Standardization (ISO 9001:2015) certifications. Many of our locations maintain additional certifications specific to the industries they serve, such as aerospace, auto, nuclear, and others, including certain international certifications.
​
Government Regulation
​
Beyond our compliance requirements with environmental regulations, compliance with government regulations has not had and, based on laws and regulations currently in effect, is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. 
​
Our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health, principally the OSHA and related regulations, which, among other requirements, establish noise, dust and safety standards. We maintain comprehensive health and safety policies and encourage our employees to follow established safety practices. 
​
We are subject to the conflict mineral provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. We are required to undertake due diligence, disclose and report whether the products we sell originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. We verify with our suppliers the origins of all metals used in our products.

We sell metals to foreign customers and otherwise operate abroad, subjecting us to various countries’ trade regulations concerning the import and export of materials and finished products. Our operations are subject to the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business that seek to prevent corruption and bribery in the marketplace, including the United States’ Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and the United Kingdom’s Bribery Act 2010. We have developed and implemented company-wide export and anti-corruption policies designed to provide our employees clear statements of our compliance requirements and to ensure compliance with applicable export and anti-corruption regulations. For information about risks related to government regulation, please see the risk factors set forth under the caption Item 1A. “Risk Factors” including the Risk Factors captioned “We are subject to various environmental, employee safety and health, and customs and export laws and regulations, which could subject us to significant liabilities and compliance expenditures;” and “We operate internationally and are subject to exchange rate fluctuations, exchange controls, political risks and other risks relating to international operations.”
​
Environmental
​
We are not a metals producer or mill – we operate metals service centers. As a distributor and “first-stage” processor of metal products, our operations, by their nature, have a limited environmental impact as we do not emit significant amounts of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases. 
​
In addition, the overwhelming majority of our operations involve the processing and distribution of inherently sustainable aluminum and steel products that we believe (i) are some of the most commonly-recycled materials in the United States and (ii) can be 100% recycled without loss of quality. We believe aluminum and steel are some of the most recycled materials on the planet—more than plastic, paper, and glass combined each year. In 2022, we reintroduced over 197,500 tons of recycled scrap material into the manufacturing life cycle.
​
We continue to evaluate and implement energy conservation and other initiatives to reduce the environmental impact of our business. However, enactment of more stringent environmental regulations could have an adverse impact on our financial results. In addition, the manufacture and production of the materials we source from mills can be a carbon-intensive activity, and adoption of more stringent carbon regulations or policies may increase the prices of these materials. 
​
As a processor and distributor of metals, and not a producer, we acknowledge and embrace our role in protecting the environment and are currently assessing our impacts. Our strong desire is to identify and prioritize areas of improvement. In order to align our environmental initiatives with our broader strategy, we completed a materiality assessment in 2021 to determine the environmental matters that are most critical to our business and our stakeholders.
​
As a result of the materiality assessment, we determined that the most material environmental issues are: (i) emissions from company-owned trucks that deliver our products; and (ii) our overall energy usage. We expect to update this materiality assessment on a periodic basis to ensure it reflects changes in our business and the external environment.
