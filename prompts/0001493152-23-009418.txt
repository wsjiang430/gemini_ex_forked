Current Overview of the Company
 
The Company is a development-stage technology company focused on fraud prevention and credit management.
 
The Company offers a proprietary software platform branded as CyberloQ®. While previously the Company licensed CyberloQ, in the third quarter of 2017, the Company acquired the CyberloQ technology and is now the exclusive owner of CyberloQ.
 
CyberloQ is a MFA ( Multi Factor Authentication ) protocol technology that is offered to institutional clients in order to combat fraudulent transactions and unauthorized access to customer accounts and or any digital asset. Through the use of a customer’s smart-phone, CyberloQ uses a multi-factor authentication system to control access to a bank card, transaction type or amount, website, database or digital service. The mobile applications for CyberloQ have been built, and have been successfully integrated into the banking ecosystem. The Company has also updated the entire infrastructure, UI/UX and streamlined the deliverable services per strategic partnerships with clients in multiple channels in order to increase the scalability of the original platform.
 
In addition to CyberloQ, the Company offers a web-based proprietary software platform under the brand name TurnScor® which allows customers to monitor and manage their credit from the privacy of their own homes. Although individuals can sign-up for TurnScor on their own, the Company also intends to market TurnScor to certain institutional clients, where appropriate, in conjunction with CyberloQ as a value-added benefit to offer their customers.
 
The CyberloQ Vault is a “cloud based’ security protocol that allows clients the ability to send/receive secure data without having to use traditional e-mail which is prone to a breach. This CyberloQ service uses cloud-based encryption and a secure web portal to send/receive confidential data, the sender and receiver both must have authenticated their position within the prescribed geo coordinates as well as authenticate their mobile devices prior to sending/receiving any data. Thus, rendering a hack or breach utterly useless for the encrypted data is unusable without the CyberloQ authentication component.
 
The Company currently has two full-time employees — its President and Vice-President. There are no other employees of the Company at this time.
 
The Company also has a Board of Advisors comprised of individuals from the banking, business development, and technical sectors to advise the Company as it moves forward with its business strategy. The Board of Advisors does not have any decision-making authority.
