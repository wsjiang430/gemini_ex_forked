 Item 1.  Business
 Overview
 We are a fully integrated provider of high‑speed data (“HSD”), cable television (“Video”), and digital telephony (“Telephony”) services to residential customers and offer a full range of products and services to business customers. Led by our robust HSD offering, our products are available either as a bundle or as an individual service to residential and business service customers. Our service area includes approximately 3.2 million homes and businesses in nineteen Midwestern and Southeastern markets in the United States. In the Midwest, the Company offers services in Detroit and Lansing, Michigan; Chicago, Illinois; Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio; Evansville, Indiana and Baltimore, Maryland. The Southeastern markets include Augusta, Columbus, Newnan and West Point, Georgia; Charleston, South Carolina; Dothan, Auburn, Huntsville and Montgomery, Alabama; Knoxville, Tennessee; and Panama City and Pinellas County, Florida.
 Since commencing operations in 2001, our focus has been to offer a competitive alternative cable service and establish a brand with a strong market position. We have built our business through (i) organic subscriber growth and increased penetration within our existing markets and footprint, (ii) network expansion to grow our footprint, (iii) upgrades to introduce enhanced broadband services to networks we have acquired, (iv) entry into business services, with a full range of HSD, Video and Telephony products and (v) acquisitions and integration of cable systems. At December 31, 2018, our networks passed 3.2 million homes and businesses and served 808 thousand total customers, reflecting a total customer penetration rate of approximately 25%.
 We operate primarily in economically stable suburbs that are adjacent to large metropolitan areas as well as secondary and tertiary markets, which we believe have favorable competitive and demographic profiles and include businesses operating across a range of industries. We benefit from the ability to augment our footprint by pursuing value‑accretive network extensions, or edge‑outs, to increase our addressable market and grow our customer base. We have historically made selective capital investments in edge‑outs to facilitate growth in residential and business services.
 We are focused on efficient capital spending and maximizing adjusted earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) through an Internet‑centric growth strategy while maintaining a profitable video subscriber base. Based on our per subscriber economics, we believe that HSD represents the greatest opportunity to enhance profitability across our residential and business markets. We believe that our advanced network is designed to meet our current and future customers’ HSD needs. We offer HSD speeds up to 1 GIG (1000 Mbps) in approximately 95% of our footprint.
 Our most significant competitors are other cable television operators, direct broadcast satellite providers and certain telephone companies that offer services that provide features and functionality similar to our HSD, Video and Telephony services. We believe that our strategy of operating primarily in suburban areas provides better operating and financial stability compared to the more competitive environments in large metropolitan markets. We have a history of successfully competing in chosen markets despite the presence of competing incumbent providers through attractive high value bundling of our services and investments in new service offerings.
 Ownership and Basis of Presentation
 We commenced operations in 2001 as WideOpenWest, LLC. WideOpenWest, LLC was wholly owned by WideOpenWest Kite, Inc., which was wholly owned by Racecar Acquisition, LLC (“Racecar Acquisition”). Racecar Acquisition was a wholly owned subsidiary of WideOpenWest Holdings, LLC (“Parent”).
 WideOpenWest, Inc. was organized in Delaware in July 2012 as WideOpenWest Kite, Inc. WideOpenWest Kite, Inc. subsequently changed its name to WideOpenWest, Inc. in March 2017.

 On April 1, 2016, we consummated a restructuring (“Restructuring”) whereby WideOpenWest Finance, LLC (“WOW Finance”) became a wholly owned subsidiary of WOW. Previously, WOW Finance was owned by WideOpenWest Illinois, Inc., WideOpenWest Ohio, Inc., WideOpenWest Cleveland, Inc., WOW Sigecom, Inc. and WOW (collectively, the “Members”). Prior to the Restructuring, the Members were wholly owned subsidiaries of Racecar Acquisition.
 As a result of the Restructuring, each of the Members, other than WOW, merged with and into WOW. WOW became the sole subsidiary of Racecar Acquisition and WOW Finance became a wholly owned subsidiary of WOW.
 On May 25, 2017, we completed an initial public offering (“IPO”), whereby we registered shares of our common stock, which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “WOW”. Prior to our IPO, WOW was wholly owned by Racecar Acquisition, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent. Subsequent to the IPO, Racecar Acquisition and Parent were liquidated and our shares distributed to their respective members. In the following context, the terms “we”, “us”, “WOW”, or “the Company” may refer, as the context requires, to WOW or, collectively, WOW and its subsidiaries.
 Certain employees of WOW participated in equity plans administered by the Company’s former Parent. The management units from the equity plan were issued from the former Parent’s ownership structure, the management units’ value directly correlated to the results of WOW, as the primary asset of the former Parent’s investment in WOW. The management units for the equity plan have been “pushed down” to the Company, as the management units had been utilized as equity‑based compensation for WOW management. Immediately prior to the Company’s IPO, these management units were cancelled. For information regarding securities issued under our equity compensation plans, see Note 14 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Part II—Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

      We believe we have one of the most technically advanced and uniform networks in the industry with approximately 97% of our network at 750 MHz or greater capacity and delivering a full suite of products including HSD, Video (including VOD and HD) and Telephony. Given the advanced and uniform nature of our next generation network, we are able to maintain the network relatively inexpensively, launch new services quickly and efficiently and maintain our own telephony infrastructure. Our advanced plant will allow us to continue to roll out competitive HD channel line ups and higher data speeds without major capital requirements.
 Our Operating Philosophy and Commitment to Customer Service
 We believe that our operating philosophy “to deliver an employee and customer experience that lives up to our name” is central to our success. This philosophy influences how we are organized and informs the process we employ to acquire and retain customers. For example, we use a needs‑based selling process to recommend packages that best fit customers’ service and pricing needs. We seek to keep our customer response activities closely coordinated with all operational aspects of our business, so that resources are appropriately allocated and operating efficiencies are optimized. We believe in offering customers an experience that is convenient for them by generally providing installation and service appointments within a two hour window, seven days a week.
 We use targeted marketing modeling to drive profitable growth and minimize risk of non‑pay churn. This analysis is performed at the node level in our network so that marketing and sales tactics drive penetration in a highly targeted manner. We also believe that the responsibility for winning new customers extends beyond the sales and marketing department to our entire company.

 We have demonstrated our ability to grow by delivering a strong customer experience, offering high value bundles and packages, and smartly and selectively introducing new competitive offerings. We believe our philosophy of providing value based pricing differentiates WOW in the market. We strive to ensure our customers can enjoy a seamless experience of one installation, one bill, and one service provider. Our strategy has led to bundled customers accounting for approximately 51% of our total customer mix. Bundling has allowed us to maximize the revenue generating capability of our networks through increased penetration, increased revenue per customer, greater pricing flexibility and increased customer retention.
 Our operating philosophy and commitment to customer service have translated into numerous independent awards and significant recognition for our focus on the customer experience. For example, WOW has:

· | been rated highest by Consumer Reports Magazine across multiple categories 15 times over the last 10 years;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Business Telephony and Data Services
 Our broadband network also supports services to business customers and we have developed a full suite of products for small, medium and large local enterprises. We offer the traditional bundled product offering and have also developed new products to meet the more complex high‑speed data and telephony needs of medium and large local enterprises. We offer fiber based services, which enable our customers to have enhanced telephony services, data speeds of up to 10 gigabit per second on our fiber network, and office‑to‑office metro Ethernet services that provide a secure and managed connection between customer locations. We have introduced our Hosted Voice product offering, which can replace customers’ aging private branch exchange (“PBX”) products with telephony and data service that offers more flexible features at a lower cost. In addition, we have a Session Initiated Protocol (“SIP”) trunking service. This service is a direct replacement for the traditional telephone service used by large PBX customers and is delivered over our fiber network and terminated via an Ethernet connection at the customer’s premise. We have a complete line of colocation infrastructure services, cloud computing, managed backup and recovery services. We serve our business customers from locally based business offices with customer service and network support 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Pricing for Our Products and Services
 We employ value based pricing strategies for our services to promote sales of bundled packages, as well as the option to purchase Internet à la carte. We offer bundles of two or more services with tiered features and prices to meet the demands of a variety of customers. The bundle approach simplifies our customers’ experience, while creating operational efficiencies by reducing the number of plans handled by our sales and call center personnel and by reducing the number of packages supported in our billing system. We also sell individual services at prices competitive to à la carte services sold by our competitors. An installation fee may be charged to new and reconnected customers. We charge monthly fees for customer premise equipment. Our Interactive Broadband Network
 Our network is critical to the implementation of our operating strategy, allowing us to offer bundled HSD, Video, Telephony, Metro Ethernet, and other enterprise class services to our customers in an efficient manner and with a high level of quality. In addition to providing high capacity and scalability, our network has been specifically engineered to have increased reliability, including features, where available, such as:
· | redundant fiber routing which enables the rapid, automatic redirection of network traffic in the event of a fiber cut;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | back‑up power supplies in our network which ensure continuity of our service in the event of a power outage; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | network monitoring to the customer premise for all digital HSD, Video and Telephony services.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Technical Overview
 Our interactive broadband network consists primarily of an advanced hybrid fiber coaxial cable network. Fiber‑optic cable is a communications medium that uses glass fibers to transmit signals over long distances with minimum signal loss or distortion. In most of our network, our system’s owned high capacity fiber‑optic cables connect to our technical facilities and multiple nodes throughout our network. These nodes are connected to individual homes and buildings by fiber and coaxial cable and are shared by a number of customers. We have sufficient fiber and cable capacity to subdivide our nodes if growth so dictates. Our HFC network has excellent broadband frequency characteristics and physical durability, which is conducive to providing HSD, Video and Telephony transmission.
 As of December 31, 2018, our network consisted of approximately 46 thousand miles of network, passed over 3.2 million homes and businesses and served approximately 808 thousand total customers. Our interactive broadband network is designed using redundant fiber‑optic cables. Our fiber rings, where deployed, are “self‑healing,” which means 

 
  9

 
that they provide for very rapid, automatic redirection of network traffic so that our service will continue even if there is a single point of failure on a fiber ring.
 We distribute our bundled services from our technical facilities called head-ends, hub sites, and data centers each of which is equipped with a generator and battery back‑up power source to allow service to continue during a power outage. Additionally, individual nodes that are served by the facilities are equipped with back‑up generators or batteries. Our redundant fiber‑optic cables and network powering systems allow us to provide telephony services consistent with industry reliability standards for traditional telephone systems.
 We monitor our network 24 hours a day, seven days a week from our network operations centers. Technicians in each of our service areas schedule and perform installations and repairs and monitor the performance of our interactive broadband network. We actively maintain the quality of our network to minimize service interruptions and extend the network’s operational life.
 High‑Speed Data Services
 We provide Internet access using high‑speed cable modems in the same way customers receive Internet services over modems linked to the local telephone network. We provide our customers with a high level of data transfer rates through multiple peering arrangements with tier‑one Internet facility providers. Video Services
 Our network is designed for digital two‑way interactive transmission with fiber‑optic cable carrying signals from the headend to hubs and to distribution points (nodes) within our customers’ neighborhoods, where the signals are transferred to our coaxial cable network for delivery to our customers. Telephony Services
 We offer telephony service over our broadband network. We install a network interface box outside a customer’s home or an Embedded Multimedia Terminal Adapter in the home to provide dial tone service. Our network interconnects with those of other local phone companies. In addition, we serve our telephony customers using Voice over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) switching technology. This newer architecture allows for the same enhanced custom calling services as traditional time division multiplexing switching systems, as well as additional advanced business services such as SIP, hosted PBX services and other services. Business Services
 In addition to the Data, Video and Telephony outlined above, we also utilize our network to provide other business services, including SIP, web hosting, metro Ethernet and wireless backhaul services. We also provide advanced colocation and cloud infrastructure services including private cage or cabinet with high availability power, virtual and physical compute, high performance storage, dedicated firewall/load balancers, private virtual local area network segmentation, disaster recovery to the cloud and backup and archive as a service. Programming
 We purchase some of our programming directly from the program networks by entering into affiliation agreements with the programming suppliers. We also benefit from our membership with the National Cable Television Cooperative (“NCTC”), which enables us to take advantage of volume discounts. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 65% of our programming was sourced from the NCTC, which also handles our contracting and billing arrangements for this programming.

 Competition
 We operate in a highly competitive and rapidly-changing environment, competing with both existing communications providers and new entrants that provide similar HSD, Video and Telephony services to subscribers within our operating footprint. We have at least one major cable competitor (typically Comcast Corporation (“Comcast”) or Charter Communications Inc. (“Charter”)) in most of our markets and our largest telecommunications competitor is AT&T, Inc. (“AT&T”). Additionally, we face increasing competition from content owners that utilize internet‑based delivery of content directly to consumers. We believe our consistent recognition for having a strong commitment to customer service provides meaningful differentiation versus our competitors. High Speed Data Services
 We primarily face competition from multiple system operators (“MSO”), fiber-to-the-home ("FTTH"), wireless broadband offerings, incumbent local exchange carriers (“ILECs”) that provide dial-up and DSL services, and other Internet access service providers, including fixed wireless and satellite-based broadband services. We offer HSD speeds up to 1 GIG (1000 Mbps) in approximately 95% of our footprint. Several of our competitors, including AT&T and Google, have announced similar offerings in their service areas which overlaps with a portion of our footprint. We face increasing competition from mobile phone companies, such as AT&T and Verizon Communications, Inc. (“Verizon”), which offer fixed or unlimited access to the Internet as a part of mobile service packages. These same mobile phone companies have announced that they plan to offer fifth generation (“5G”) services in the future Due to rapidly changing technologies, consumers will continue to have a variety of options to obtain access to the Internet.   Video Services
 Cable television systems are operated under non‑exclusive franchises granted by local authorities, which may result in more than one cable operator providing video services in a particular market. Our primary competitors are other fiber and hybrid fiber coaxial providers, including Charter, Comcast and AT&T U-verse, and direct broadcast satellite systems, including DirecTV (a subsidiary of AT&T) and Dish Network, which transmit signals to small dish antennas owned by the end‑user.
 We face increasing competition from companies that deliver video content over Internet connections, referred to as “over-the-top” or “OTT”, directly to consumers on televisions, computers, tablets, gaming and mobile devices. These competitors include virtual multichannel video programming distributors (“V-MVPD”), which aggregate live and on-demand linear television, and direct content distributors, which provide and distribute content directly to customers through an internet connected device for a subscription fee. Examples of V-MVPD providers include Sling TV, DirecTV Now, YouTube Live, PlayStation Vue, and Hulu Live.  Examples of direct content distributors include Netflix, Roku, Apple TV, Amazon Prime, and Hulu. Additionally, some programmers, such as HBO and CBS, are choosing to deliver content directly to the consumer over the Internet.  
 We believe the movement away from traditional video subscription services will continue and negatively impact our video subscriber base. However, we believe that we are positioned to benefit as these customers will require robust Internet connection in order to efficiently access such OTT content, which could lead to increased demand for our HSD services. 
 Telephony Services
 We mainly compete against wireless, VoIP, and wireline telephone providers. VoIP places and transmits telephone calls over an IP network, such as the Internet, instead of the traditional public switched telephone network. Our primary wireless and VoIP competitors include AT&T, Verizon, Charter, Comcast and Frontier. We expect Internet based technology, including video conferencing, instant messaging, smart speakers, home automation and email, to rapidly evolve to include or displace the need for telephony services. Given the continuously changing technology and various communications options, competition will continue to intensify for telephony service subscribers.

 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 2,600 full‑time employees. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and we structure our compensation and benefit plans in order to attract and retain high‑performing employees. We will continue to recruit employees to meet the needs of our strategic plans. We recruit from several major industries for employees with skills in high‑speed data, video and telephony technologies. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Legislation and Regulation
 We operate in highly regulated industries and both our cable television and telecommunications services are subject to broad regulation at the federal, state and local levels. Our Internet services have historically been subject to more limited regulation, although the Federal Communications Commission’s (“FCC”) 2015 Open Internet Order expanded regulation of Internet services as more fully described below. The following is a summary of laws and regulations affecting the cable television and telecommunications industries. It does not purport to be a complete summary of all present and proposed legislation and regulations pertaining to our operations. Regulation of Cable Services
 The FCC is the principal federal regulatory agency with jurisdiction over cable television operators and services, and has promulgated regulations covering many aspects of cable television operations. The composition of the FCC changed in January 2017. The newly composed FCC has modified some regulations applicable to our business; however, the full impact of these changes on our business is unknown. The FCC enforces its regulations through the imposition of monetary fines, the issuance of cease‑and‑desist orders and/or the imposition of other administrative sanctions. Cable franchises, the principal instrument of governmental authority for our cable television operations, are not issued by the FCC but by states, cities, counties or political subdivisions. A brief summary of certain key federal regulations follows. Rate Regulation
 The Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 (“1992 Cable Act”) authorized rate regulation for certain cable services and equipment in certain markets. It also eliminated direct oversight of rates by the FCC and local franchising authorities of all but the basic service tier of cable service. Rate regulation of the basic tier does not apply, however, when a cable operator is subject to effective competition in the relevant community. Under an order issued by the FCC in 2015, cable operators are presumed to be subject to effective competition. That Order was appealed to the D.C. Circuit Court, which denied the petition for review. Moreover, some local franchising authorities that could otherwise regulate basic rates for cable systems that are not subject to effective competition choose not to do so. We are not currently subject to cable service rate regulation in any of our markets. Program Access
 To promote competition between incumbent cable operators and independent cable programmers, the 1992 Cable Act placed restrictions on dealings between certain cable programmers and cable operators. Satellite video programmers affiliated with cable operators are prohibited in most cases from favoring those cable operators over competing distributors of multi‑channel video programming, such as satellite television operators and unaffiliated competitive cable operators such as us. Specifically, the program access regulations generally prohibit exclusive contracts for satellite cable programming or satellite broadcast programming between any cable operator and any cable‑affiliated programming vendor. On October 5, 2012, the FCC adopted and released a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the Matter of Revision of the Commission’s Program Access Rules (“Program Access FNPRM”). The FCC declined to extend the exclusive contract prohibition section of the program access rules beyond its October 5, 2012 sunset date. The prohibition applies only to programming that is delivered via satellite; it does not apply to programming delivered via terrestrial facilities. The FCC determined that a preemptive prohibition on exclusive contracts is no longer “necessary to preserve and protect competition and diversity in the distribution of video programming” considering that 

 
  12

 
a case‑by‑case process will remain in place after the prohibition expires to assess the impact of individual exclusive contracts. In the Program Access FNPRM, the FCC also requested comment on revisions to the program access rules pertaining to buying groups and rebuttable presumptions in program access complaint proceedings challenging certain exclusive contracts. The Program Access FNPRM is still pending.
 Commercial Leased Access
 The Communications Act requires that cable systems with 36 or more channels make available a portion of their channel capacity for commercial leased access by third parties to facilitate competitive programming efforts. We have not been subject to many requests for carriage under the leased access rules. Carriage of Broadcast Television Signals
 The 1992 Cable Act established broadcast signal carriage (so‑called “must carry”) requirements that allow local commercial television broadcast stations to elect every three years whether to require the cable systems in the relevant area to carry the station’s signal or whether to require the cable system to negotiate for consent to carry the station. The most recent election by broadcasters became effective January 1, 2018. Cable systems are also subject to must‑carry obligations for local, non-commercial stations. We now carry most commercial stations pursuant to retransmission consent agreements and pay fees for such consents. Franchise Authority
 Cable television systems operate pursuant to non‑exclusive franchises issued by franchising authorities, which, depending on the specific jurisdiction, can be the states, cities, counties or political subdivisions in which a cable operator provides cable service. Franchising authority is premised upon the cable operator crossing and using public rights‑of‑way to construct and maintain its system. The terms of franchises, while variable, typically include requirements concerning services, franchise fees, construction timelines, mandated service areas, customer service standards, technical requirements, public, educational and government access channels and support, and channel capacity. Franchise authorities may terminate a franchise or assess penalties if the franchised cable operator fails to adhere to the conditions of the franchise. Although largely discretionary, the exercise of state and local franchise authority is limited by federal statutes and regulations adopted pursuant thereto. We believe that the requirements imposed by our franchise agreements are fairly typical for the industry. Although they do vary, our franchises generally provide for the payment of fees to the applicable franchise authority of up to 5% of our gross cable service revenues, which is the current maximum authorized by federal law. Many of our franchises also require that we pay a percentage of our gross revenue in support of public, educational and governmental (“PEG”) channels. These so‑called PEG fees vary, but generally do not exceed 2% of our gross cable services revenues.
 On December 20, 2006, the FCC established rules and provided guidance (“2006 Order”) pursuant to the Communications Act that prohibit local franchising authorities from unreasonably refusing to award competitive franchises for the provision of cable services. In order to eliminate certain barriers to entry into the cable market, and to encourage investment in broadband facilities, the FCC preempted local laws, regulations, and requirements, including local level‑playing‑field provisions, to the extent they impose greater restrictions on market entry than those adopted under the order. This order has the potential to benefit us by facilitating our ability to obtain and renew cable service franchises. On January 21, 2015, the FCC issued an Order on Reconsideration of the Second Report and Order. The FCC clarified that the franchising rules and findings it extended to incumbent cable operators in the 2006 Order do not apply to state laws governing cable television operators, or to any state‑level cable franchising process. In its Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking released September 25, 2018, the FCC has sought comment on this conclusion.
 Many state legislatures have enacted legislation streamlining the franchising process, including having the state, instead of local governments, issue franchises. Of particular relevance to us, states with laws streamlining the franchising process or authorizing state‑wide or uniform franchises currently include Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, South Carolina and Tennessee. In some cases, these laws enable us to expand our operations more rapidly by

providing for a streamlined franchising process. At the same time, they enable easier entry by additional providers into our service territories.
 Franchise Renewal
 Franchise renewal, or approval for the sale, transfer or assignment of a franchise, may involve the imposition of additional requirements not present in the initial franchise agreement. Franchise renewal is not guaranteed, but federal law imposes certain standards to prohibit the arbitrary denial of franchise renewal. Our franchises are typically issued for 10 to 15 year initial terms, but the terms vary depending upon whether we are operating under a local or state franchise, and many of our existing franchise terms will expire over the course of the next several years. Still, we expect our franchises to be renewed by the relevant franchising authority. The 2006 Order discussed under Franchise Authority above, as well as some state laws that regulate the issuance of state video franchises, reduce the potential for unreasonable conditions being imposed upon renewal. Pole Attachments
 The Communications Act requires all local telephone companies and electric utilities, except those owned by municipalities and co‑operatives, to provide cable operators and telecommunications carriers with nondiscriminatory access to poles, ducts, conduit and rights‑of‑way at just and reasonable rates, except where states have certified to the FCC that they regulate pole access and pole attachment rates. The right to access poles, ducts, conduits and rights‑of‑way pursuant to regulated rates and set timeframes is highly beneficial to facilities‑based providers such as us. Federal law also establishes principles to govern the pricing and terms of such access. Currently, 20 states and the District of Columbia have made certifications to the FCC, which leaves pole attachment matters to be regulated by those states. Of the states in which we operate, Illinois, Michigan and Ohio have made certifications to the FCC. The FCC has clarified that the provision of Internet services by a cable operator does not affect the agency’s jurisdiction over pole attachments by that cable operator, nor does the provision of such non‑cable services affect the rate formula otherwise applicable to the cable operator.
 In April 2011, the FCC adopted an order that examined a number of issues involving access to pole attachments by telecommunications carriers, including the rights of ILECs to demand nondiscriminatory access in certain situations, and which attempted to bring the rates that cable operators and telecommunications carriers charge closer to parity. In November 2015, the FCC released another order taking further steps to balance the rates paid by cable operators and telecommunications carriers. Part of the order addresses some industry members’ concerns that pole attachment rates might increase sharply after the FCC reclassified broadband service as telecommunications service as discussed further below. The 2015 order was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit, which rejected the petition. It is uncertain, however, how the Open Internet Order and the Internet Freedom Order discussed below might impact attachment rights and costs.
 Internet Service
 To date, the FCC has rejected requests by some Internet service providers to require cable operators to provide unaffiliated Internet service providers with direct access to the operators’ broadband facilities. On December 23, 2010, the FCC adopted “net neutrality” rules requiring fixed and mobile providers of broadband Internet access to comply with certain disclosure and other rules designed to maximize consumer access to broadband services (“2010 Open Internet Order”). In summary, the rules impose obligations related to ensuring provider transparency and preventing unreasonable blocking and discrimination of content, applications or services. In general, the requirements, which took effect on November 20, 2011, permit reasonable network management practices by broadband providers. Challenges to the “net neutrality” rules, including the FCC’s jurisdiction to adopt the rules, were filed in federal appellate court. On January 14, 2014, a D.C. Circuit panel struck down the portions of the FCC’s 2010 Open Internet Order rules that had banned blocking or discriminatory treatment of websites or other online applications by retail broadband Internet access providers such as incumbent telephone companies and cable operators (“D.C. Circuit Order”). At the same time, the court approved the agency’s requirement that broadband providers adequately disclose their policies regarding blocking 

 
  14

 
and “network management” (that is, practices for avoiding network congestion, giving priority to some classes of traffic over others, etc.).
 On February 26, 2015, the FCC announced that it reclassified broadband Internet access as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Communications Act (“Open Internet Order”). The FCC announced that its Open Internet Order prohibits: (i) broadband providers from blocking access to legal content, applications, services, or non‑harmful devices; (ii) broadband providers from impairing or degrading lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content, applications, services, or non‑harmful devices; and (iii) broadband providers from favoring some lawful Internet traffic over other lawful traffic in exchange for consideration of any kind—in other words, no “fast lanes.” This rule also bans ISPs such as us from prioritizing content and services of their affiliates. The FCC further announced that its Open Internet Order will require additional disclosure and network management practices, and will extend a number of the Title II regulatory requirements to broadband Internet access services, such as compliance with the privacy provisions of Section 222 of the Communications Act.
 The legality of the Open Internet Order was challenged in court by a number of parties. On June 14, 2016, the D.C. Circuit upheld the Open Internet Order.
 The composition of the FCC changed in January 2017. On December 14, 2017, the Commission adopted the Restoring Internet Freedom Declaratory Ruling, Report and Order (the “Internet Freedom Order”), which repealed the Open Internet Order and reclassified broadband Internet access as an information service, not subject to Title II of the Communications Act. The Internet Freedom Order is subject to a pending court challenge, the outcome of which is uncertain. In addition, some states have adopted or are considering the adoption of net neutrality principles. It is unknown at this time how the Internet Freedom Order may affect our business.
 Tier Buy‑through
 The tier buy‑through prohibition contained in the 1992 Cable Act generally prohibits cable operators from requiring subscribers to purchase a particular service tier, other than the basic service tier, in order to obtain access to video programming offered on a per‑channel or per‑program basis. In general, a cable television operator has the right to select the channels and services that are available on its cable system. With the exception of certain channels that are required to be carried by federal law as part of the basic tier, such as certain local broadcast television channels, the cable operator has broad discretion in choosing the channels that will be available and how those channels will be packaged and marketed to subscribers. In order to maximize the number of subscribers, the cable operator selects channels that are likely to appeal to a broad spectrum of viewers. If Congress or the FCC were to place more stringent requirements on how we package our services, such requirements could have an adverse effect on our profitability. Potential Regulatory Changes
 The regulation of cable television systems at the federal, state and local levels has substantially changed over the past two decades since enactment of the 1992 Cable Act. Material additional changes in the law and implementing regulatory requirements, both those described above and others cannot be ascertained with any certainty at this time. Our business could be adversely affected by future changes in regulations. Regulation of Telecommunication Services
 Our telecommunications services are subject to varying degrees of federal, state and local regulation. Pursuant to the Communications Act, as amended by the 1996 Act, the FCC generally exercises jurisdiction over the facilities of, and the services offered by, telecommunications carriers that provide interstate or international communications services. The FCC has extended many of its regulations that apply to traditional telecommunications service to Internet based, or interconnected VoIP phone services. Barring federal preemption, state regulatory authorities retain jurisdiction over the same facilities to the extent that they are used to provide intrastate communications services, as well as facilities solely used to provide intrastate services. Local regulation is largely limited to the management of the occupation and use of county or municipal public rights‑of‑way. Various international authorities may also seek to regulate the provision of 

 
  15

 
certain services. As addressed in more detail above, in the Internet Freedom Order, the FCC reversed the Open Internet Order and re‑characterized broadband Internet access services as information services no longer subject to various Title II requirements.
 Regulation of Local Exchange Operations
 Our ILEC subsidiaries are regulated by both federal and state agencies. Our interstate products and services and the regulated telecommunications earnings of all of our subsidiaries are subject to federal regulation by the FCC, and our local and intrastate products and services and the regulated earnings are subject to regulation by state public service commissions (“PSC”). The FCC has principal jurisdiction over matters including, but not limited to, interstate switched and special access rates. The FCC also regulates the rates that ILECs and CLECs may charge for the use of their local networks in originating or terminating interstate and international transmissions. PSCs have jurisdiction over matters including local service rates, intrastate access rates and the quality of service.
 The Communications Act places certain obligations, including those described below, on ILECs to open their networks to competitive providers, as well as heightened interconnection obligations and a duty to make their services available to resellers at a wholesale discount rate. The following are certain obligations that the Communications Act and the 1996 Act, as implemented by the FCC, place on ILECs, which gives us important rights in the areas where we operate as competitors, and actual or potential obligations where our ILEC subsidiaries operate:

· | Interconnection. Establishes requirements and standards applicable to ILECs that receive requests from other carriers for network interconnection, unbundling of network elements, colocation of equipment and resale, and requires all local exchange carriers (“LECs”) to enter into mutual compensation arrangements with other for transport and termination of local calls on each other’s networks.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Reciprocal Compensation. Requires all ILECs and CLECs to complete calls originated by competing local exchange carriers under reciprocal arrangements.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Colocation of Equipment. Allows CLECs to install and maintain their own network equipment in ILEC central offices.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Number Portability. Requires all providers of telecommunications services, as well as providers of interconnected VoIP services, to permit users of telecommunications services to retain their existing telephone numbers without impairment of quality, reliability or convenience when switching from one telecommunications provider to another.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Access to Rights‑of‑Way. Requires telecommunications carriers to permit other carriers access to poles, ducts, conduits and rights‑of‑way at regulated prices and set time frames.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We have entered into PSC approved local interconnection agreements with a variety of telecom providers for, among other things, the transport and termination of our local and toll telephone traffic. Some of these agreements have expired; however, we continue to operate on the same rates, terms, and conditions in the interim as we seek to enter into successor agreements. These agreements are subject to changes as a result of changes in laws, regulations and technology, and there is no guarantee that the rates and terms concerning our interconnection agreements with ILECs under which we operate today will be available in the future.
 Inter‑Carrier Compensation
 Our ILEC subsidiaries currently receive compensation from other telecommunications providers, including long distance companies, for origination and termination of interexchange traffic through network access charges that are established in accordance with state and federal laws. Accordingly, we benefit from the receipt and termination of intrastate and interstate long distance traffic.

 
  16

 

 Several of our subsidiaries are classified by the FCC as non‑dominant carriers with respect to both interstate and international long‑distance services and competitive local exchange services. As non‑dominant carriers, these subsidiaries’ rates presently are not generally regulated by the FCC, although the rates are still subject to general statutory requirements applicable to all carriers that the rates be just, reasonable and nondiscriminatory. We may file tariffs for interstate access charges for these carriers on a permissive basis, but otherwise our interstate services are mandatorily detariffed and subject to our ability to enter into relationships with our customers through contracts. Our interstate access services are tariffed and fall within FCC‑established benchmarks for such services.
 Certain of our subsidiaries are regulated by the FCC as dominant carriers in the provision of interstate switched access services. These subsidiaries must file tariffs with the FCC and must provide the FCC with notice prior to changing their rates, terms or conditions of interstate access services. Each such subsidiary has filed its own tariff or concurred in the tariffs filed by the National Exchange Carrier Association.
 Regulatory Treatment of VoIP Services
 A significant part of our telephony line of business is classified by the FCC as VoIP. At this time, the FCC and state regulators have not classified most IP‑enabled services as regulated telecommunications services. The FCC, for example, has applied to providers of “interconnected VoIP” services some of its rules applicable to traditional circuit switched telephone providers, but has yet to issue a ruling determining whether interconnected VoIP providers are to be regulated as providers of information services or telecommunications services. The FCC initiated a rulemaking proceeding in 2004 to examine issues relating to the appropriate regulatory classification of IP‑enabled services, including VoIP services. We cannot predict when or if the FCC will issue a final decision in this proceeding, though it has issued several decisions in the interim applying certain regulatory requirements to providers of interconnected VoIP services. These requirements include, among others, regulations relating to federal universal service contributions, the confidentiality of customer data and communications, cooperation with law enforcement, discontinuation of service, numbering and number portability, outage reporting, 911 emergency access and disability access. The FCC has also established certain other requirements that impact our VoIP services. For example, the FCC requires that we provide certain notices to our VoIP customers concerning the limitations of the services, particularly in connection with the ability of the service (including access to E911) to function in the event of a power outage. We are also required to offer our customers a back‑up power solution to enable the services to continue to function in the event of a power outage. Within our VoIP line of business, we currently comply with all applicable regulations that have been issued by the FCC or state regulatory agencies. Decisions and regulations from similar proceedings in the future could lead to an increase in the costs associated with providing VoIP services. At this time, we are unable to predict the impact, if any, that additional regulatory action on these issues will have on our business.
 Universal Service
 The Federal Universal Service Fund (“USF”) is the support mechanism established by the FCC to ensure that high quality, affordable telecommunications service is available to all Americans. Pursuant to the FCC’s universal service rules, all telecommunications providers and interconnected VoIP providers, including us, must contribute a percentage of their interstate and international end‑user telecommunications and interconnected VoIP revenues to the USF. The FCC establishes an industry‑wide quarterly contribution factor, which sets the exact percentage that applies for the given quarter. The contribution factor for the first quarter of 2019 is 20% of gross assessable interstate and international telecommunications and interconnected VoIP revenues. The contribution rate is reviewed quarterly and may increase or decrease, which would either increase or decrease our contributions to the USF. This is not materially adverse to our business as we currently choose to recover the cost of the contributions from our end user customers. However, climbing USF contributions may negatively impact our end users because they effectively make our products more expensive. Forbearance and Other Relief to Dominant Carriers
 The Communications Act permits the FCC to forbear from requiring telecommunications carriers to comply with certain of its regulations and provisions of the Communications Act if certain conditions are present that make 

 
  17

 
enforcement of the regulations or statutory provisions unnecessary. Future reduction or elimination of federal regulatory and statutory requirements could free us from regulatory burdens, but might also increase the relative flexibility of our major competitors. As a result of grants of forbearance, our costs (and those of our competitors) of purchasing broadband services from carriers could increase significantly, as the rates, terms and conditions offered in non‑tariffed “commercial agreements” may become less favorable and we may not be able to purchase services from alternative vendors.
 Multiple Tenant Properties
 The FCC has prohibited telecommunications carriers from entering into exclusive access agreements (or enforcing pre‑existing exclusive arrangements) with building owners or managers in both commercial and residential multi‑tenant environments. The FCC has also adopted rules requiring utilities (including ILEC’s) to provide telecommunications carriers (and cable operators) with reasonable and non‑discriminatory access to utility‑owned or ‑controlled conduits and rights‑of‑way in all multiple tenant environments (e.g., apartment buildings, office buildings and campuses) in those states where the state government has not certified to the FCC that it regulates utility pole attachments and rights‑of‑way matters. These requirements may facilitate our access (as well as the access of competitors) to customers in multi‑tenant environments, at least with regard to our provision of telecommunications services.
 In an order released November 13, 2007, the FCC found that contractual agreements between multiple dwelling unit (“MDU”) owners and cable operators that grant exclusive access to the cable operator are proscribed as “unfair methods of competition.” Under the rule, the Commission prohibits the enforcement of existing exclusivity clauses and the execution of new ones by cable operators and others subject to the relevant statutory provisions. MDUs include a multiple dwelling unit building and any other centrally managed residential real estate development (such as a gated community, mobile home park, or garden apartment complex). These requirements facilitate our access (as well as the access of competitors) to customers in MDU environments, at least with regard to our provision of cable services. They also, however, invalidate any of our existing exclusive access agreements covered by the rules.
 Customer Proprietary Network Information and Personally Identifiable Information 
 We are subject to specific customer privacy obligations with respect to our telecommunications and video services. FCC rules protect the privacy of certain information about customers that telecommunications providers, including us, acquire in the course of providing voice telecommunications services. Such protected information, known as Customer Proprietary Network Information (“CPNI”), includes information related to the quantity, technological configuration, type, destination and the amount of use of a telecommunications offering. Certain states have also adopted state‑specific CPNI rules. The FCC’s rules require affected providers to implement policies to notify customers of their rights, take reasonable precautions to protect CPNI and notify law enforcement agencies if a breach of CPNI occurs. If a federal or state regulatory body determines that we have breached the applicable regulations or implemented the FCC’s requirements incorrectly, we could be subject to fines or penalties.
 Section 631 of the Communications Act requires that we protect the privacy of our video customers. In general, that section: (i) requires that cable operators, such as us, notify customers of our obligations and their privacy rights; and (ii) prohibits cable operators from: (a) disclosing cable customer personally identifiable information (PII) without customer consent, or a court order, except in limited situations; and (b) using the cable system to collect PII without customer consent, unless necessary to provide service or prevent theft of service. Section 631 specifically provides our customers with the right to bring legal action against us if we fail to comply with the statutory requirements.
 In addition, statutory protections in Section 222 of the Communications Act, apply to our VoIP services. In the Internet Freedom Order, the FCC returned jurisdiction to regulate broadband privacy and data security to the Federal Trade Commission.

 
  18

 

 Privacy continues to be a major focus of Congress, the Federal Trade Commission, the FCC, the U.S. Department of Commerce and the states. Additional laws, regulations or advisory guidelines could affect our ability to use and share customer information under various additional circumstances.
 Taxes and Regulatory Fees
 We are subject to numerous local, state and federal taxes and regulatory fees, including, but not limited to, local sales taxes, franchise fees and PEG fees, FCC regulatory fees and PSC regulatory fees. We have procedures in place to ensure that we properly collect taxes and fees from our customers and remit such taxes and fees to the appropriate entity pursuant to applicable law and/or regulation. If our collection procedures prove to be insufficient or if a taxing, franchise or regulatory authority determines that our remittances were inadequate, we could be required to make additional payments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Environmental Regulation
 We are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local environmental, safety and health laws, and regulations, including those governing such matters as the generation, storage, reporting, treatment, handling, remediation, use, disposal and transportation of and exposure to hazardous materials, the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the atmosphere, the emission of electromagnetic radiation, the protection of wetlands, historic sites and threatened and endangered species, and health and safety. We also may be subject to laws requiring the investigation and cleanup of contamination at sites we own or operate or at third‑party waste disposal sites. Such laws often impose joint and strict liability even if the owner or operator did not know of, or was not responsible for, the contamination. We operate several sites in connection with our operations. Our switch sites and some customer premise locations are equipped with backup power sources in the event of an electrical failure. Each of our switch site locations has battery and diesel fuel powered backup generators, and we use batteries to back up some of our customer premise equipment. In addition, some of our sites may have potential contamination risks from historical and surrounding activities. We are not aware of any liability or alleged liability at any owned or operated sites or third‑party waste disposal sites that would be expected to have a material adverse effect on us. Franchises
 As described above, cable television systems generally are constructed and operated under the authority of nonexclusive franchises, granted by local and/or state governmental authorities. Cable system franchises typically contain many conditions, such as time limitations on commencement and completion of system construction, customer service standards including number of channels, the provision of free service to schools and certain other public institutions, the maintenance of insurance and indemnity bonds, the payment of franchise fees and the support of PEG channels. We are currently in the process of renegotiating a small number of expired franchises. We anticipate that those franchises will be renewed. Local regulation of cable television operations and franchising matters is currently subject to federal regulation under the Communications Act and the corresponding regulations of the FCC. The FCC has taken recent steps toward streamlining the franchising process. See Legislation and Regulation—Regulation of Cable Services above.
 Prior to the scheduled expiration of franchises, we may initiate renewal proceedings with the relevant franchising authorities. The Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 provides for an orderly franchise renewal process in which the franchising authorities may not unreasonably deny renewals. If a renewal is withheld and the franchising authority takes over operation of the affected cable system or awards the franchise to another party, the franchising authority must pay the cable operator the “fair market value” of the system. The Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 also established comprehensive renewal procedures requiring that the renewal application be evaluated on its own merit and not as part of a comparative process with other proposals.
