Item 1. Business
Company overview
We are a leading independent personal lines insurance agency, based on personal lines revenue, reinventing the traditional approach to distributing personal lines products and services throughout the United States. We were founded with one vision in mind—to provide consumers with superior insurance coverage at the best available price and in a timely manner. By leveraging our differentiated business model and innovative technology platform, we are able to deliver to consumers a superior insurance experience. Our business model, in contrast to the traditional insurance agency model, separates the sales function from the service function, thus enabling agents to focus on selling, and service personnel to focus on delivering superior client service. In addition, our technology platform empowers our agents with tools to better manage their sales initiatives and provides our service personnel with real-time 360-degree visibility of client accounts. As a result, we have achieved best-in-class net promoter scores for client service, nearly 2.1x the 2017 P&C industry average.
We represent over 85 insurance companies that underwrite personal lines and small commercial lines risks, which typically enables us to provide broader insurance coverage at a lower price point than competing agents who represent only a few carriers, carriers with captive agents or carriers that distribute directly to consumers.
Our business has grown substantially since our founding in 2003. Today we are a rapidly-growing independent insurance agency and franchisor in the United States. Our operations now include a network of seven corporate sales offices and 646 franchise locations (inclusive of 189 franchises which are under contract but yet to be opened as of December 31, 2018). In addition, we have service center operations at our headquarters and in Henderson, Nevada. Our growth is reflected in our financial performance. Revenue grew period over period by 41% and 36% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. This growth has been driven by our recruiting team’s ability to recruit talented agents to our platform, our agents’ leveraging of Goosehead's sales blueprint and proprietary technology leading to higher levels of productivity in winning new business and our service centers’ ability to retain renewal business. All of our growth has been organic; we have not relied on mergers or acquisitions. Furthermore, we are profitable. For the year ended December 31, 2018 the Company had $8.7 million of net loss due to IPO-related equity compensation, but generated $14.8 million of Adjusted EBITDA, a $4.0 million increase over 2017. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP Measure. See "Item 7. Management's discussions and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - Key performance indicators" for additional information and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
Our insurance product offerings primarily consist of homeowner’s insurance; auto insurance; other personal lines products, including flood, wind and earthquake insurance; excess liability or umbrella insurance; specialty lines insurance (motorcycle, recreational vehicle and other insurance); commercial lines insurance (general liability, property and auto insurance for small businesses); and life insurance. We do not take any insurance underwriting risk in the operation of our business.
We enter into Carrier Appointments that set the terms of engagement, define legal ownership of client accounts and client data, and determine compensation. Our 2018 average commission rate on new business premium was 15% and on renewal business premium was 14%. Commission rates can vary across Carriers, states and lines of business, and typically range from 10% to 20%. Because we represent a broad set of Carriers that all have unique risk appetites and underwriting strategies, we can usually provide our clients with broader insurance coverage at a lower price point than competing agents who represent only one Carrier exclusively, or Carriers that distribute directly to insurance buyers.
We have two Segments that work together to drive our growth: the Corporate Channel and Franchise Channel. The Corporate Channel consists of company-owned and financed operations with employees who are hired, trained and managed by us. The Corporate Channel also serves as a research and development department, where we develop best practices and beta test new technology before implementing system-wide. The Franchise Channel consists of Franchisee operations that are owned and managed by Franchisees. These Franchisees have a contractual relationship with us to use our processes, systems, and back-office support team to sell insurance and manage their business. In exchange, we are entitled to an Initial Franchise Fee and ongoing Royalty Fees. We manage our two Segments from our headquarters in Westlake, Texas. In addition to managing our Segments, our headquarters is responsible for overseeing our client service centers, our network of Referral Partners, our recruiting team and our technology functions which tie all aspects of our business together. Our headquarters also provides various risk management, quality control, accounting, legal and finance functions.

In the Corporate Channel, we generate revenue in the form of New Business Revenue (Corporate), Renewal Revenue (Corporate), and non-refundable Agency Fees charged directly to clients for efforts performed in the issuance of new insurance policies. We also generate revenue in the form of Contingent Commissions from Carriers related to the overall performance of the Book of Business we have placed with them. The Corporate Channel is comprised of sales agents that are our employees located in six sales offices in Texas and one in Illinois. We have experienced rapid growth in sales agents and revenue in this Segment. During 2018, our Corporate Channel sales agent headcount increased by 50% and our Corporate Channel premiums placed grew by 33%, in each case, versus the prior year. Corporate Channel premium growth trailed headcount growth due to the large renewal mix of our premiums placed and the ongoing ramp up of recently hired producers. As of December 31, 2018, we had corporate sales offices operating in the following locations: Westlake, Texas; Irving, Texas; Fort Worth, Texas; Houston, Texas; The Woodlands, Texas; Austin, Texas; and Rosemont, Illinois.
In the Franchise Channel, we generate revenue in the form of Royalty Fees paid by Franchisees that are tied to New Business Revenue and Renewal Revenue generated by the franchise location, Initial Franchise Fees related to the training and onboarding of new franchise locations and Contingent Commissions. Royalty Fees are set in the Franchise Agreements at 20% of New Business Revenue and 50% of Renewal Revenue. We charge a non-refundable Initial Franchise Fee to new Franchisees which compensates us for the training and onboarding efforts to launch a new franchise location. The Franchise Channel is comprised of Franchisees and sales agents that they hire in their franchised businesses. Our Franchise Agreement has a ten-year term, dictates the Initial Franchise Fee, Royalty Fees and other costs a Franchisee pays, and governs the terms under which we operate together. Franchisees have contractual rights to revenue related to the Book of Business during the term of their agreement.
We started franchising in 2012 and have grown rapidly in the Franchise Channel. Premiums in the Franchise Channel grew 60% during 2018. As of December 31, 2018, we have 457 franchise locations operating, a 57% increase over year-end operating agencies in 2017, and 189 signed Franchise Agreements that are in the implementation process. We have franchise locations either operating or signed in the following states:

Our business model allows our sales agents in both Segments to concentrate on sales and marketing activities related to acquiring new clients and issuing new policies, thus growing New Business Revenue and Renewal Revenue. Their primary marketing efforts are focused on establishing referral relationships with other financial services providers in their communities using our marketing strategy. The nature of Referral Partner leads allows us to realize higher close rates and lower client acquisition costs than what we believe to be standard in the industry. Furthermore, our agents are typically dealing with homeowners who own other assets, such as automobiles and therefore tend to be better insurance risks from a Carrier’s perspective. Such clients often purchase additional policies, such as auto insurance, which allows us to capture additional revenue and increases the likelihood of retaining the client in the future. Importantly, we do not compensate Referral Partners for leads, but rather rely on our servicing capabilities to generate repeat business.
6

We have significant room to expand our market share across the country. Our biggest presence is in Texas where we have been operating the longest. By leveraging our Referral Partners, we placed approximately 35 thousand policies related to mortgage originations in 2018. This represents 10.2% of the approximately 344 thousand Texas mortgage originations 2018, according to the Texas A&M Real Estate Center.
Our model, which allows agents to focus on New Business Revenue, is highly differentiated from the traditional insurance agency model. In the traditional agency model, agents are responsible for both new business and ongoing service. The burden of providing ongoing service distracts from the ability to acquire new clients, and ultimately limits the opportunity for growth. Our agents are not only freed from the burden of ongoing service, but also given technology tools that create efficiency. As a result, agents in both Segments are substantially more productive than top performers in our industry as it relates to new sales. Compared to the 2018 Best Practices Study, which uses 2017 industry data, Corporate Channel agents with more than three years of tenure averaged 3.4x as much New Business Production per Agent as the industry best practice during 2017. Franchise Channel agents with more than three years of tenure averaged 1.5x as much New Business Production per Agent (Franchise) as the industry best practice during 2017.
Source: Internal data; Carrier provided information; Reagan Consulting

(1) | Represents industry best practice per Reagan Consulting; does not include Unvalidated Producers; most industry agents have tenures significantly longer than 2 to 3 years.

We believe our agent productivity compares even more favorably to the industry than the Best Practices Study would imply because the Best Practices Study excludes Unvalidated Producers. If the Best Practices Study included Unvalidated Producers, our New Business Production per Agent outperformance would be even larger. 
In the Corporate Channel, New Business Production per Agent was $70 thousand and $127 thousand for agents with less than 1 year of tenure and greater than one year of tenure, respectively, during 2018. Including all producers in the Franchise Channel, New Business Production per Agency was $43 thousand and $87 thousand for agencies with less than 1 year of tenure and greater than one year of tenure in Texas, respectively, during 2018. Outside of Texas, New Business Production per Agency was $40 thousand and $59 thousand for agencies with less than 1 year of tenure and greater than one year of tenure, respectively, during 2018.
Both the Corporate Channel and the Franchise Channel are supported by our client service centers. Our service centers are staffed by fully licensed property and casualty service agents who provide fulfillment and quality control services for newly issued insurance policies, accounting services and ongoing support services for clients. Ongoing support services for clients include: handling client inquiries, facilitating the claims process with Carriers, accepting premium payments and processing policy changes and renewals. Our service agents are also focused on selling additional policy coverage to clients which accounts for additional New Business Revenue. Our two separate service centers provide us with the ability to cover the U.S. time zones more broadly, and the ability to better manage business continuity risks. We manage our service centers with the goal that clients reach an agent in less than 60 seconds and are able to have fully bound insurance policies in under an hour. This differentiated level of service has enabled us to earn an NPS of 89 in 2018 and 86 in 2017—greater than highly regarded brands like Ritz Carlton and Nordstrom and 2.1x the 2017 industry average, according to Satmetrix. Our high degree of client 
7

satisfaction drove our 88% Client Retention rate during 2018, which we believe to be among the highest in the industry. Our retention rate is even stronger on a premium basis. In 2018, we retained 94% of the premiums we distributed in 2017. Our premium retention rate is higher than our Client Retention rate as a result of both premiums increasing year over year and additional coverages sold by our service team. By maintaining this strong level of Client Retention, we are able to generate revenue that is both highly visible and recurring in nature.
The combination of expanding headcount in the Corporate Channel, expanding franchise count in the Franchise Channel, leveraging technology and maintaining our commitment to service led to revenue growth of 41% and Total Written Premium growth of 49% in 2018. This level of Total Written Premium growth is consistent with our historical experience of accelerated growth. As of December 31, 2018, our 10-year Total Written Premium CAGR was 35% and our 5-year premium CAGR was 45%.

In addition to strong revenue and Total Written Premium growth, we have also experienced Franchise Channel Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, which was 33% in 2018, up from 27% in 2017. Corporate Channel Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased modestly in 2018 to 22% from 25% due to our Corporate Channel sales agent headcount growth of 50%.

Industry trends
We primarily compete in the United States personal lines insurance distribution industry. Personal lines products typically include home, auto, umbrella, motorcycle, flood and recreational insurance. We compete for business on the basis of reputation, client service, product offerings and the ability to tailor our products to the specific needs of a client. There are principally three types of businesses that sell personal lines products:
8


• | Independent agencies (35% personal lines market share in 2017 according to the Independent Insurance Agents & Brokers of America, Inc.). Independent agencies are “independent” of any one Carrier and can offer insurance products from multiple Carriers to their clients. There are approximately 36,500 independent insurance agencies in the United States, according to the 2018 Future One Agency Universe Case Study. Many of the largest insurance agencies, such as Aon plc, Arthur J. Gallagher & Co., Brown & Brown Inc., Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. and Willis Towers Watson plc, focus primarily on commercial lines. We believe that we are one of the largest independent insurance agencies focused primarily on personal lines.


• | Captive Agencies (47% personal lines market share in 2017 according to the Independent Insurance Agents & Brokers of America, Inc.). Captive Agencies sell products for only one Carrier. The Carrier compensates the Captive Agency through sales commissions based on premiums placed on behalf of clients. The Carrier also provides the Captive Agency with operational support including advertising and certain back office functions. The largest Captive Agencies in the United States include Allstate Corporation, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company and Farmers Group, Inc.


• | Direct distribution (18% personal lines market share in 2017 according to the Independent Insurance Agents & Brokers of America, Inc.). Certain Carriers market their products directly to clients. Historically, this strategy has been most effective for targeting clients who require auto insurance only, with clients seeking bundled solutions relying on advice from independent and captive agents. The largest Carriers that sell directly to clients include Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (via GEICO Corp.) and Progressive Corporation.

Personal lines insurance agents generate revenues through commissions, which are calculated as a percentage of the total insurance premium placed on behalf of clients, and through fees for other related services. Premiums in the personal lines insurance market have grown consistently with underlying insured values and the overall economy.

Premium pricing within the P&C insurance industry has historically been cyclical, based on the underwriting capacity of the insurance industry and economic conditions. External events, such as terrorist attacks, and man-made and natural disasters, can also have significant impacts on the insurance market. We use the terms ‘‘soft market’’ and ‘‘hard market’’ to describe the business cycles experienced by the industry. A soft market is an insurance market characterized by a period of declining premium rates, which can negatively affect commissions earned by insurance agents. A hard market is an insurance market characterized by a period of rising premium rates, which, absent other changes, can positively affect commissions earned by insurance agents.
In recent years, auto insurance premium pricing has been in a hard market as accident costs have risen
significantly. Between 2014 and 2016, bodily injury costs rose 11.7% and auto property damage costs rose 15.1%,
according to the Insurance Information Institute. Conversely, homeowners insurance premium pricing has recently
been in a soft market according to the Counsel of Independent Agents and Brokers. However, the 2017 Atlantic
Hurricane season was one of the most active in recent history. Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC estimates
that Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria will result in insured losses ranging from $70 billion to more than $100 billion and insured losses from the recent California wildfires to be $15 billion; similar levels of industry losses in the
past have resulted in a hardening of the insurance market.
Our segments
9

Our Segments are geared to leverage the strengths of two different talent pools to maximize productivity. The Corporate Channel recruits young agents who are typically new to insurance distribution; the Franchise Channel primarily recruits agents with industry experience. The combination of our two Segments enables us to prudently expand our business model while providing differentiated service to our clients.
Corporate Channel (57% of 2018 total revenue)
The Corporate Channel primarily targets young agents, particularly recent college graduates who typically do not have experience in the insurance industry. The majority of candidates are sourced through a combination of on-campus recruiting, employee referrals and highly targeted internet recruiting campaigns. Our recruitment team seeks candidates who display a high aptitude for learning new skills, are motivated by professional and financial incentives and display the ability to succeed in a team-oriented environment. After the recruitment team has selected candidates, they are placed into a training class that lasts approximately two weeks. Corporate Channel agents are required to become fully licensed P&C agents prior to training. During the training class, Corporate Channel agents acquire a wide variety of skills including:

• | knowledge of all available personal lines products and the trade-offs between pricing and coverage;


• | the ability to fit their clients to the best insurance products at the right price point;


• | the ability to leverage our well-established network of Referral Partners to win new business;


• | the ability to leverage our service centers to service policies and handle renewal activities; and


• | the ability to leverage our technology tools to increase productivity.

The combination of hiring highly motivated and talented individuals, giving them proper tools and training and removing the burden of ongoing client service allows our Corporate Channel agents to become significantly more productive than average personal lines agents. Compared to the 2018 Best Practices Study, Corporate Channel agents with more than two years of tenure averaged 3.4x as much New Business Production per Agent (Corporate) as the industry best practice. Corporate Channel agents with less than two years of tenure averaged 2.0x as much New Business Production per Agent (Corporate) as the industry best practice.
Franchise Channel (43% of 2018 total revenue)
The Franchise Channel primarily recruits agents with industry experience. Our Franchise Channel has a unique value proposition to experienced agents who understand the limits and pain points of the traditional agency model:

• | Franchise Channel agents gain access to products from multiple carriers in their markets, allowing Franchise Channel agents to better serve their clients and provide choice. Captive Agents typically can only sell products from one Carrier.


• | Franchise Channel agents can leverage our service centers to handle service requests and process renewals. Most traditional agencies require their agents to handle client service and renewals which diminishes the time they can devote to winning additional new business and growing their agencies. Traditional agencies can become the victims of their own success as their increasing service burden crowds out time to sell new business.


• | Franchise Channel agents use our well-established sales processes to win new business. Franchise Channel agents are trained side by side with Corporate Channel agents to leverage our training program, to acquire product and Carrier knowledge and to utilize our technology and back office support.


• | Franchise Channel agents benefit from lean startup costs as they do not require multiple employees or a retail location to run their agencies. Captive Agents are often required to immediately hire two to three additional employees as support staff, lease a storefront location, and contribute a specific percentage of revenue toward an advertising budget. Further, most fixed costs in a traditional agency (e.g., administrative costs, technology fees, training expenses and service costs) are diminished in our Franchise Channel due to Goosehead’s scale, and we expect that they will continue to decrease as the Franchise Channel grows.


• | Franchise Channel agents own an economic interest in their Books of Business.

Our franchise sales team is responsible for recruiting the Franchisee applicants that are ultimately approved to operate within the Franchise Channel. The franchise sales team seeks applicants who have demonstrated a strong capacity to win new business and a desire to own their own business. Our recruiting efforts have helped us create a franchise pool which is significantly more productive than average personal lines agents. Compared to the 2018 Best Practices Study, Franchise Channel agents with more than three years of tenure averaged 1.5x as much New 
10

Business Production per Agent (Franchise) as the industry best practice. Franchise Channel agents with less than two years of tenure maintained equally as much New Business Production per Agent (Franchise) as the industry best practice.
Our competitive strengths
We believe that our competitive strengths include the following:

• | Young and highly motivated producers in the Corporate Channel. The agents in the Corporate Channel are fundamentally different than the typical agents in the personal lines industry. Substantially all of our agents are recent college graduates (average age of 27), whereas 64% of personal lines agents in the industry are over 50 years old, according to the 2018 Future One Agency Universe Case Study. This gives us a significant advantage both in the short- and long-term. In the short-term, our agents have proven to be especially adept at learning new techniques and mastering new technologies. This has enabled our agents to generate approximately 3.4x as much new business as top performing personal lines agents after three years, according to the 2018 Best Practices Study. Over the long-term, we believe our youth will enable us to avoid the shrinking workforce challenges that many of our competitors face and win an even larger market share from other agencies. According to Independent Insurance Agents & Brokers of America, Inc., 42% of independent agencies anticipate a change of control within the next five years. We believe an aging industry workforce will create significant disruption in the personal lines distribution industry, and we will be in a position to win displaced clients.


• | Franchise Channel solves the inherent flaws in the traditional agency model. We believe that the traditional agency model is flawed for several reasons, including: (1) Captive Agents can only offer clients products from one Carrier, limiting the agents’ ability to best serve their clients, (2) agents are typically responsible for handling their own client service and renewals, diminishing the time they can devote to winning new business and growing their overall Book of Business and (3) some Captive Agents do not own their Book of Business, giving them less incentive to win new business. Given the size of the traditional agency market and its inability to adapt to these challenges without introducing significant channel conflict, we believe there is a meaningful opportunity to disrupt the traditional agency marketplace. Our Franchise Channel seeks to solve the inherent problems in the traditional agency model. Agents in the Franchise Channel are able to focus on new business, provide clients with choice by offering products from multiple Carriers, and own an economic interest in their Book of Business. Furthermore, by removing the service burden which takes a significant amount of time and energy, we believe our platform provides Franchise Channel agents with the ability to manage larger Books of Business than agents working in a traditional agency model. As a result, the Goosehead model has proven to be attractive to high-performing agents who wish to achieve greater professional and financial success.


• | Single technology platform with end-to-end business process management. Our operations utilize an innovative cloud-based technology solution which is built on the Salesforce.com platform with significant proprietary investment to customize it to suit our needs. Our technology provides our agents with tools to better manage their sales and marketing activities, and our service center operations with real-time 360-degree visibility of client accounts. Additionally, our technology provides agents with data and analytics which allow them to make smarter business decisions. We believe our single, sales-oriented technology platform is differentiated relative to most insurance agency IT environments that utilize disparate accounting-driven agency management vendors and legacy mainframe systems across their operations. Our technology platform has been a key enabler of our growth while also driving efficiencies. One of these efficiencies is service expenses. Our 2017 service expenses as a percentage of gross commissions were 4.0x lower than the industry best practice according to the 2018 Best Practices Study, which uses 2017 data. Despite our reduced service expense load, we are able to maintain best in class NPS scores and typically deliver policy binders in under an hour.


• | Service centers drive both new and renewal business. Our service centers handle all of our client service and renewals and have achieved a highly differentiated level of service as indicated by our NPS scores of 89 in 2018 and 86 in 2017—higher than many global service leaders such as Ritz Carlton and Nordstrom and 2.1x the P&C industry average, according to Satmetrix. Having such a skilled service team provides three tangible benefits to our business: (1) allowing our agents to focus virtually all of their time on winning new business (instead of preserving existing business), (2) generating strong Client Retention which provides a stable source of highly visible and recurring revenue and (3) providing opportunities to earn additional revenue as our service agents are highly trained in cross-selling and generating referral business. Our service agents typically originate significant amounts of New Business Revenue through cross-sale and referral generation. We believe that our service centers will continue to drive a competitive advantage by supporting our industry-leading productivity and our recruiting efforts. We continue to make the necessary technology, staffing and real estate investments

11

in our service centers to support our planned agent hiring which we believe will allow us to readily scale and increase market share.

• | Unique value proposition to Referral Partners. We have highly standardized processes across our entire organization due to the strong quality controls instituted in our service centers. Both new business and renewal business move through our systems in a tightly choreographed manner which enables both strong quality controls and quick delivery of services. We have found that the ability to quickly and accurately bind an insurance policy is attractive to both individuals buying insurance and third parties, such as Referral Partners, who can drive new business to us. Referral Partners include financial services providers who depend on us to timely place insurance policies and to provide the flexibility to facilitate necessary changes rapidly, including at the time of home closings. This allows our Referral Partners to close transactions on time and ultimately become more productive in their business. We do not compensate our Referral Partners for sending us new business.


• | Proven and experienced senior management team. Our senior management team has a long history of cohesively operating together and implementing our business model. Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mark E. Jones, co-founded Goosehead in 2003. Prior to co-founding Goosehead, Mr. Jones was a Senior Partner and Director at Bain & Company, a global management consulting firm, where he also served for many years as Global Head of Recruiting. Many of our management, sales and recruiting practices were developed and refined by Mr. Jones during his time at Bain and instituted at Goosehead. Mr. Jones has received a wide variety of accolades for his leadership accomplishments, including being recognized as one of the Top Rated CEOs from among more than 7,000 companies with less than 1,000 employees on Glassdoor’s “Employee’s Choice Award” in 2017. In 2006, Mr. Jones recruited Michael Colby to join Goosehead as Controller. Over the last 12 years, Mr. Colby has worked closely with Mr. Jones in all aspects of the business, taking on increasing responsibility; becoming Chief Financial Officer in 2010, Chief Operating Officer of our Franchise Channel in 2011, Chief Operating Officer of Goosehead in 2014, and President and Chief Operating Officer of Goosehead in 2016.

Key elements of our growth strategy
Our goal is to achieve long-term returns for our stockholders by establishing ourselves as the premier national distributor of personal lines insurance products. To accomplish this goal, we intend to focus on the following key areas:

• | Continue to expand recruiting in the Corporate Channel. We strive to prudently grow our business by expanding our agent count in the Corporate Channel. We have a highly developed process for recruiting new agents which we have continually refined over the last decade and has resulted in higher success rates for our Corporate Channel agents. As demonstrated in the chart below, our compensation package for sales agents is very competitive in comparison to other professional services and offers attractive long-term compensation opportunities.

Given our success recruiting agents, we plan to expand our recruiting to additional college campuses and engage in highly targeted internet recruiting campaigns.
12


• | National rollout of the Franchise Channel. Prior to 2018, we had franchises in ten states (Texas, California, Florida, Virginia, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina, Louisiana and Oklahoma). In 2018, we targeted expansion into Colorado, Connecticut, Indiana, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, South Carolina, Washington and Wisconsin. As of December 31, 2018, we have signed Franchise Agreements in each of these states. The success of the national rollout of the Franchise Channel is only starting to emerge in our financial performance. As of December 31, 2018, 61% of our Franchisees had less than one year of tenure.


(1) | Number of franchise locations include 189 franchises which are under contract but yet to be opened as of December 31, 2018.

Given the anticipated New Business productivity uplift that comes with more years of experience, and the elevated Royalty Fees on renewal business, we believe our Franchise Channel is positioned for strong growth and margin expansion. This growth will be further enhanced by the approximately 65,000 potential franchise candidates in our current pipeline. The number of potential franchise candidates is updated daily to reflect any new franchise candidates on our Salesforce.com platform. We identify our franchise candidates according to the following criteria: (1) work experience, including sales, entrepreneurial or insurance experience; (2) license status; and (3) geographic location. Of our total current pipeline, we estimate approximately 10% of the candidates would qualify over time as Franchisees under our exacting standards. Although the candidates that meet our franchise standards are not guaranteed to enter into Franchise Agreements, we believe our pipeline will allow us to execute a national build-out of our model. The pace of our national build-out will be aided by the regulatory approvals, product offering approvals and carrier relationships we have already obtained across the continental United States.

• | Continue to develop innovative ways to drive productivity. We believe that our agents are already among the most efficient personal lines agents in the industry. Compared to the 2018 Best Practices Study, Corporate Channel agents with more than three years of tenure averaged 3.4x as much New Business Production per Agent (Corporate) as the industry best practice; Franchise Channel agents with more than three years of tenure averaged 1.5x as much New Business Production per Agent (Franchise) as the industry best practice. We believe there is an opportunity to further expand productivity, particularly in the Franchise Channel. We have historically deployed the intellectual capital accumulated in the Corporate Channel (including sales practices, client relationship management practices, recruiting practices and technology) into the Franchise Channel to optimize new business production. We will continue to innovate going forward in an effort to both better serve our clients and expand our platform.

• | Maximize our effectiveness in managing renewal business. Renewal business mechanically increases revenue and mechanically decreases expenses. On the revenue side, we earn significantly larger Royalty Fees from our Franchisees for renewal business. On the expense side, many of our largest expenses are significantly lower for renewal business such as compensation costs, risk management costs and client development costs. Critical to converting new business into renewal business is strong Client Retention. Our Client Retention effort is led by our service centers which had a 2018 NPS score of 89, leading to an 88% Client Retention rate and 94% premium retention rate in 2018. Key to maintaining these NPS scores and Client Retention rates is the consistency of personnel in our service centers. Our consistency in service personnel is due to a combination of the respect we have for our service team and the competitive wages we offer; average compensation for service team employees was over $46,000 in 2018. Our Client Retention rates are further enhanced by Mr. Jones’ experience at Bain, where he was one of the leaders in developing Bain’s approach to managing client loyalty in the insurance industry. We actively employ the insights Mr. Jones gleaned during his time at Bain to successfully convert new business into higher-margin renewal business.

Technology
We have invested heavily in our technology platform to not only support our business, but to drive growth and productivity. Our operations utilize an innovative cloud-based technology solution which is built on the Salesforce.com platform with significant proprietary investment to customize it to suit our needs:

• | In 2009, we rolled out Salesforce.com across our entire platform. Our customized agency management system provided us with transparency into client lifecycle, a sophisticated commission accounting application and enhanced analytic capabilities.


• | In 2010, we integrated DocuSign into our Salesforce.com platform, improving client experience and Carrier compliance.


• | In 2011, we added Franchise Channel capabilities which enabled efficient management of Franchisees. We also created the infrastructure necessary to protect sensitive Franchisee information including Client lists. We also rolled-out our email engine which provides marketing automation for cross-selling.


• | In 2013, we created our Carrier knowledge database (a reference library of Carrier underwriting guidelines) and our Referral Partner platform (creates precision and coordination in Referral Partner marketing).


• | In 2015, we established our learning management system which enables efficient compliance training, initial training, and continuing education.


• | In 2016, we invested in InGenius which enhanced customer service capabilities with CTI (computer telephony integration), omni-channel and SMS texting capabilities.


• | 2018 was a watershed year for GSHD's technology innovation as we further enhanced our technology platform and strengthened our barriers to entry. The year was highlighted by the following developments:


◦ | GSHD's integrated comparative rater was rolled out that eliminated 75% of the required input fields, saving the majority of our agents approximately 15 minutes per quote.


◦ | A proprietary mortgage database was made available to our agents providing them a marketing tool with sophistication and precision down to the micro-targeted level to improve client prospecting.


◦ | A unified, cloud-based voice solution was implemented system-wide, using AI driven speech analytics to evaluate agent performance and customer sentiment.


◦ | We further enhanced our cyber-security protection via Salesforce Shield, continuing education using our proprietary learning management system, and additional email filtering tools.

Markets & marketing
We primarily compete in the approximately $329 billion U.S. personal lines P&C industry, according to A.M. Best. As a distributor, we compete for business on the basis of reputation, client service, product offerings and the ability to efficiently tailor our products to the specific needs of a client. 
Agents in both the Corporate Channel and the Franchise Channel are primarily responsible for acquiring new clients. Agents are encouraged to procure new clients through both relationships with Referral Partners and traditional channels (friends, family, client referrals, inbound inquiries and outbound inquiries). Referral Partners are typically professionals in the home buying process who rely on us to quickly bind accurate home insurance policies.

While traditional channels are an important source of new business, Referral Partners typically provide us with a high-quality source of ongoing business leads. Clients sourced through Referral Partners are generally in the process of either buying or refinancing a house. These clients frequently purchase additional policies such as auto insurance. By leveraging our Referral Partner network, we have been able to quickly gain scale in the personal lines property and casualty industry without incurring other significant direct client acquisition costs, such as advertising or purchasing internet leads.
The Company represents over 85 Carriers, of which 30 provide national coverage. In 2018, two carriers represented more than 10% of total revenue at 17% and 11%. In 2017, three carriers represented more than 10% of total revenue at 18%, 15% and 11%.
Franchise agreements
Our Franchise Channel operates under a franchising model and each franchise is governed by a Franchise Agreement. The Franchise Agreements for all existing franchises are nearly identical. We have taken the position that we do not negotiate the terms of our Franchise Agreements in order to maintain uniformity within the system.
Each Franchise Agreement contains one ten-year term with two optional five-year renewal terms. The Franchise Agreement may be terminated early if the Franchisee is violating a term of the contract, operating contrary to state law, or violating Goosehead procedures required by the operations manual.
Franchisees are required to pay an Initial Franchise Fee that varies depending on the state in which the franchise will be located. Franchisees are also required to pay a monthly Royalty Fee, which entitles the Franchisee to continue to operate in our Franchise Channel. The Royalty Fee is derived from a percentage of gross revenues on insurance policies in their initial (20%) and renewal terms (50%). Franchise owners are not entitled to an exclusive territory and may solicit sales from any location within the state in which they operate, subject to certain internal restrictions.
Franchisees who sign a Franchise Agreement after January 1, 2018, are required to pay a minimum monthly Royalty Fee if the Royalty Fee derived from the gross revenues on insurance policies does not exceed a specific amount.
Franchises operating in the Franchise Channel increased by 57% to 457 in 2018 from 292 in 2017 and increased by 54% to 292 in 2017 from 190 in 2016.
Competition
The insurance brokerage business is highly competitive, and numerous firms actively compete with us for customers and insurance markets. Competition in the insurance business is largely based upon innovation, knowledge, terms and condition of coverage, quality of service and price. A number of firms and banks with substantially greater resources and market presence compete with us.
Our brokerage operations compete with firms, which operate globally or nationally or are strong in a particular region or locality and may have, in that region or locality, an office with revenues as large as or larger than those of our corresponding local office. We believe that the primary factors determining our competitive position with other organizations in our industry are the quality of the services we render, the technology we use, the diversity of products we offer, and the overall costs to our clients.
A number of Carriers directly sell insurance, primarily to individuals, and do not pay commissions to third-party agents and brokers. In addition, the Internet continues to be a source for direct placement of personal lines insurance business. While it is difficult to quantify the impact on our business from individuals purchasing insurance over the Internet, we believe this risk would generally be isolated to personal lines customers with single-line auto insurance coverage, which represent a small portion of our overall business.
Intellectual property
We have registered “Goosehead,” “Goosehead Insurance,” and our logo as trademarks in the U.S. We also have filed other trademark applications in the U.S. and will pursue additional trademark registrations and other intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective. We also are the registered holder of a variety of domain names that include “Goosehead” and similar variations.
Regulatory matters
15

Franchise regulation. Offers and sales of franchises (so-called “pre-sale” franchise activities) are regulated in the United States by the FTC as well as certain states. The FTC (through its “Franchise Rule”) requires franchisors to provide certain disclosures, in the form of a franchise disclosure document (an “FDD”) to prospective Franchisees. One of the disclosure requirements is to include in the FDD audited financial statements of the franchisor (Goosehead Insurance Agency, LLC) or, if not the franchisor, an affiliate or parent of the franchisor who guarantees the franchisor’s obligations to its franchisees. In order to include our consolidated financial statements in the FDD, we are required to guarantee Goosehead Insurance Agency, LLC’s current and future obligations to its franchisees. The Franchise Rule does not require a franchisor to register or file an FDD with the FTC before offering franchises. Approximately twenty states also have pre-sale franchise or “business opportunity” laws and regulations that require franchisors to register with the state in some manner before that franchisor may offer or sell a franchise in that state, and in some cases to also provide prospective Franchisees with certain additional disclosures as part of the FDD. Approximately twenty-four states also have “franchise relationship laws” that address post-sale aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship, such as prohibiting enforcement of certain franchise agreement provisions, requiring a certain notice or cure period before termination of a franchise agreement, and also defining what constitutes “good cause” for terminating the franchise agreement or denying a transfer or renewal of the agreement. Although we believe that our Franchise Agreements and our relationships with Franchisees generally have complied with franchise relationship laws, a failure to comply with those laws could result in civil liability or the company’s inability to enforce a Franchise Agreement, among other things. In addition, while historically our franchising operations have not been materially adversely affected by such laws or regulations, we cannot predict the effect of any future federal or state franchise laws or regulations.
Licensing. We and/or our designated employees must be licensed to act as brokers, intermediaries or third-party administrators by state regulatory authorities in the locations in which we conduct business. Regulations and licensing laws vary by individual state and are often complex.
The applicable licensing laws and regulations in all states are subject to amendment or reinterpretation by regulatory authorities, and such authorities are vested in most cases with relatively broad discretion as to the granting, revocation, suspension and renewal of licenses. It is our belief that we are in compliance with the applicable licensing laws and regulations of all states in which we currently operate. However, the possibility still exists that we and/or our employees could be excluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of our activities in, or could otherwise be subjected to penalties by, a particular jurisdiction.
Agent and broker compensation. Some states, such as Texas, permit insurance agents to charge agency fees, while other states prohibit this practice. In recent years, several states considered new legislation or regulations regarding the compensation of brokers by Carriers. The proposals ranged in nature from new disclosure requirements to new duties on insurance agents and brokers in dealing with customers.
Rate regulation. Nearly all states have insurance laws requiring personal property and casualty insurers to file rating plans, policy or coverage forms, and other information with the state’s regulatory authority. In many cases, such rating plans, policy or coverage forms, or both must be approved prior to use.
The speed with which an insurer can change rates in response to competition or in response to increasing costs depends, in part, on whether the rating laws are (i) prior approval, (ii) file-and-use, or (iii) use-and-file laws. In states having prior approval laws, the regulator must approve a rate before the insurer may use it. In states having file-and-use laws, the insurer does not have to wait for the regulator’s approval to use a rate, but the rate must be filed with the regulatory authority prior to being used. A use-and-file law requires an insurer to file rates within a certain period of time after the insurer begins using them. Eighteen states, including California and New York, have prior approval laws. Under all three types of rating laws, the regulator has the authority to disapprove a rate filing.
While we are not an insurer, and thus not required to comply with state laws and regulations regarding insurance rates, our commissions are derived from a percentage of the premium rates set by insurers in conjunction with state law.
Privacy regulation. Federal law and the laws of many states require financial institutions to protect the security and confidentiality of customer information and to notify customers about their policies and practices relating to collection and disclosure of customer information and their policies relating to protecting the security and confidentiality of that information. Federal law and the laws of many states also regulate disclosures and disposal of customer information. Congress, state legislatures, and regulatory authorities are expected to consider additional regulation relating to privacy and other aspects of customer information.
Employees
16

As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 389 full-time and 14 part-time employees. Our Franchisees are independent businesses and their employees and independent contractor sales associates are therefore not included in our employee count. None of our employees are represented by a union. We have a good relationship with our employees.
Corporate Channel sales agent headcount increased by 50% to 167 in 2018 from 111 in 2017 and increased by 61% to 111 in 2017 from 69 in 2016.
Initial Public Offering and Organizational Transactions
On May 1, 2018 Goosehead Insurance, Inc. completed an initial public offering (the “Offering”) of 10 million shares of Class A common stock at a price of $10.00 per share, which included 1 million shares issued pursuant to the underwriter's over-allotment option. GSHD became the sole managing member of Goosehead Financial, LLC. GF was organized on January 1, 2016 as a Delaware Limited Liability Company and is headquartered in Westlake, TX. The operations of GF represent the predecessor to GSHD prior to the Offering, and the consolidated and combined entities of GF are described in more detail below. Information for any periods prior to May 1, 2018 relates to GF and its subsidiaries and affiliates.
In connection with the Offering, the company completed the following transactions (the "Reorganization Transactions"):

• | The GF limited liability company agreement was amended to, among other things, i) appoint GSHD as the sole managing member of GF and ii) modify the capital structure of GF by reclassifying the interests previously held by Pre-IPO LLC Members into a single new class of non-voting LLC Units.


• | GSHD was authorized to issue two classes of common stock. 10 million shares of Class A common stock were issued pursuant to the Offering, including the underwriters' over-allotment option. 23 million shares of Class B common stock were issued to the Pre-IPO LLC Members in an amount equal to the number of LLC Units held by each such Pre-IPO LLC Member in exchange for certain management rights of GF. Each share of Class A common stock and Class B common stock entitles its holder to one vote per share on all matters submitted to a vote of GSHD's stockholders. Each share of Class B common stock can be exchanged for one share of Class A common stock or, at GSHD's discretion, a cash payment equal to the volume weighted average market price of one share of Class A common stock, thus canceling the share of Class B common stock on a one-for-one basis.


• | The Goosehead Management Holders and Texas Wasatch Holders indirectly transferred their ownership interests in GM and TWIHG, respectively, to GSHD in exchange for the Goosehead Management Note and Texas Wasatch Note. The aggregate principal amount of the Goosehead Management Note and the Texas Wasatch Note was approximately $114 million. Because the net proceeds from the Offering were insufficient to repay the aggregate principal amount of the notes, 4 million shares of Class A common stock were issued to the Goosehead Management Holders and the Texas Wasatch Holders for the difference. GSHD contributed direct and indirect ownership interests in each of TWIHG and GM to GF.

Following completion of the Reorganization Transactions and the Offering, GSHD owned 37.3% of GF and the Pre-IPO LLC Members owned the remaining 62.7%. GSHD is the sole managing member of GF and, although GSHD holds a minority economic interest in GF, GSHD has the sole voting power and control of management of GF. Accordingly, GSHD consolidates the financial results of GF and reports non-controlling interest in GSHD's consolidated financial statements.
As of December 31, 2018, Goosehead Insurance, Inc. owned 38.0% of Goosehead Financial, LLC and the non-controlling interest holders owned the remaining 62.0% of Goosehead Financial, LLC.
