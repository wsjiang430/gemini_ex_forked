ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

The Company
We are a self-administered REIT active in premier office and mixed-use submarkets along the West Coast. We own, develop, acquire and manage real estate assets, consisting primarily of Class A properties in the coastal regions of Greater Los Angeles, Orange County, San Diego County, the San Francisco Bay Area and Greater Seattle, which we believe have strategic advantages and strong barriers to entry. Class A real estate encompasses attractive and efficient buildings of high quality that are attractive to tenants, are well-designed and constructed with above-average material, workmanship and finishes and are well-maintained and managed. We qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). We own our interests in all of our real estate assets through the Operating Partnership and the Finance Partnership and generally conduct substantially all of our operations through the Operating Partnership.
Our stabilized portfolio of operating properties was comprised of the following properties at December 31, 2018: 

 | Number ofBuildings | RentableSquare Feet | | Number ofTenants | Percentage Occupied | Percentage Leased
Stabilized Office Properties | 94 | | 13,232,580 | | 482 | | 94.4 | % | 96.6 | %


 | Number ofBuildings | Number of Units | | 2018 Average Occupancy
Stabilized Residential Property | 1 | | 200 | | 79.7 | %

Our stabilized portfolio includes all of our properties with the exception of development and redevelopment properties currently committed for construction, under construction or in the tenant improvement phase, undeveloped land and real estate assets held for sale. We define redevelopment properties as those properties for which we expect to spend significant development and construction costs on the existing or acquired buildings pursuant to a formal plan, the intended result of which is a higher economic return on the property. We define properties in the tenant improvement phase as properties that we are developing or redeveloping where the project has reached cold shell condition and is ready for tenant improvements, which may require additional major base building construction before being placed in service. Projects in the tenant improvement phase are added to our stabilized portfolio once the project reaches the earlier of 95% occupancy or one year from the date of the cessation of major base building construction activities. Costs capitalized to construction in progress for development and redevelopment properties are transferred to land and improvements, buildings and improvements, and deferred leasing costs on our consolidated balance sheets at the historical cost of the property as the projects are placed in service.
As of December 31, 2018, the following properties were excluded from our stabilized portfolio. We did not have any redevelopment properties or properties held for sale at December 31, 2018. 

 | Number of Properties/Projects | Estimated Rentable Square Feet (1)(unaudited)
In-process development projects - tenant improvement (2) | 2 | 1,150,000 
In-process development projects - under construction (3) | 3 | 1,290,000 

________________________

(1) | Estimated rentable square feet upon completion.


(2) | Includes 88,000 square feet of Production, Distribution, and Repair (“PDR”) space.


(3) | In addition to the estimated office and PDR rentable square feet noted above, development projects under construction also include 96,000 square feet of retail space and 801 residential units.

Our stabilized portfolio also excludes our future development pipeline, which as of December 31, 2018, was comprised of five potential development sites, representing approximately 73 gross acres of undeveloped land. 
As of December 31, 2018, all of our properties and development projects were owned and all of our business was conducted in the state of California with the exception of eight office properties and one development project under construction located in the state of Washington. All of our properties and development projects are 100% owned, excluding four office properties owned by three consolidated property partnerships, and one project held in a Variable 
 5

Interest Entity (“VIE”) which we consolidated for financial reporting purposes (see Note 2 “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements included in this report). The one project held in a VIE was to facilitate a transaction intended to qualify as a like-kind exchange pursuant to Section 1031 of the Code (“Section 1031 Exchange”) to defer taxable gains on dispositions for federal and state income tax purposes that closed in January 2019. Two of the three property partnerships, 100 First Street Member, LLC (“100 First LLC”) and 303 Second Street Member, LLC (“303 Second LLC”), each owned one office property in San Francisco, California through subsidiary REITs. As of December 31, 2018, the Company owned a 56% common equity interest in both 100 First LLC and 303 Second LLC. The third property partnership, Redwood City Partners, LLC (“Redwood LLC”), owned two office properties in Redwood City, California. As of December 31, 2018, the Company owned an approximate 93% common equity interest in Redwood LLC. The remaining interests in all three property partnerships were owned by unrelated third parties. All three property partnerships are consolidated entities. 
We own our interests in all of our real estate assets through the Operating Partnership and the Finance Partnership and generally conduct substantially all of our operations through the Operating Partnership of which we owned a 98.0% common general partnership interest as of December 31, 2018. The remaining 2.0% common limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership as of December 31, 2018 was owned by non-affiliated investors and certain of our executive officers and directors. Kilroy Realty Finance, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is the sole general partner of the Finance Partnership and owns a 1.0% common general partnership interest in the Finance Partnership. The Operating Partnership owns the remaining 99.0% common limited partnership interest. With the exception of the Operating Partnership and our consolidated property partnerships, all of our subsidiaries are wholly-owned.

Business and Growth Strategies
Growth Strategies.    We believe that a number of factors and strategies will enable us to continue to achieve our objectives of long-term sustainable growth in Net Operating Income (defined below) and FFO (defined below) as well as maximization of long-term stockholder value. These factors and strategies include:

• | the quality, geographic location, physical characteristics and operating sustainability of our properties;


• | our ability to efficiently manage our assets as a low cost provider of commercial real estate through our seasoned management team possessing core capabilities in all aspects of real estate ownership, including property management, leasing, marketing, financing, accounting, legal, and construction and development management;


• | our access to development, redevelopment, acquisition and leasing opportunities as a result of our extensive experience and significant working relationships with major West Coast property owners, corporate tenants, municipalities and landowners given our over 70-year presence in the West Coast markets;


• | our active development program and our future development pipeline of undeveloped land sites (see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —Factors That May Influence Future Results of Operations” for additional information pertaining to the Company’s in-process and future development pipeline);


• | our capital recycling program (see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership” for additional information pertaining to the Company’s capital recycling program and related property and land dispositions);


• | our ability to capitalize on inflection points in a real estate cycle to add quality assets to our portfolio at substantial discounts to long-term value, through either acquisition, development or redevelopment; and


• | our strong financial position that has and will continue to allow us to pursue attractive acquisition and development and redevelopment opportunities.

“Net Operating Income” is defined as consolidated operating revenues (rental income, tenant reimbursements and other property income) less consolidated operating expenses (property expenses, real estate taxes, provision for bad debts and ground leases). “FFO” is Funds From Operations available to common stockholders and common unitholders calculated in accordance with the white paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). (See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —Results of Operations” and “—Non-GAAP Supplemental Financial Measures: Funds From Operations” for a reconciliation of these measures to generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) net income available to common stockholders.)
Operating Strategies.    We focus on enhancing long-term growth in Net Operating Income and FFO from our properties by:

• | maximizing cash flow from our properties through active leasing, early renewals and effective property management;


• | structuring leases to maximize returns;

 7


• | managing portfolio credit risk through effective underwriting, including the use of credit enhancements and interests in collateral to mitigate portfolio credit risk;


• | managing operating expenses through the efficient use of internal property management, leasing, marketing, financing, accounting, legal, and construction and development management functions;


• | maintaining and developing long-term relationships with a diverse tenant base;


• | continuing to effectively manage capital improvements to enhance our properties’ competitive advantages in their respective markets and improve the efficiency of building systems;


• | continuing to expand our management team with individuals who have extensive regional and product-type experience and are highly knowledgeable in their respective markets and product types; and


• | attracting and retaining motivated employees by providing financial and other incentives to meet our operating and financial goals.

Development and Redevelopment Strategies.    We and our predecessors have developed office properties primarily located in California since 1947. As of December 31, 2018, we had two projects in the tenant improvement phase totaling approximately 1.2 million square feet of office and PDR space and three projects under construction totaling approximately 1.3 million square feet of office space, 801 residential units and 96,000 square feet of retail space. In addition, our future development pipeline was comprised of five potential development sites representing approximately 73 gross acres of undeveloped land on which we believe we have the potential to develop over 5.0 million square feet of office, life science, laboratory and retail space, depending upon economic conditions. Our strategy with respect to development is to: 

• | own land sites in highly populated, amenity rich locations that are attractive to a broad array of tenants;


• | be the premier provider of modern and collaborative office and mixed-use projects on the West Coast with a focus on design and environment; 


• | maintain a disciplined approach by commencing development when appropriate based on market conditions, focusing on pre-leasing, developing in stages or phasing, and cost control;


• | reinvest capital from dispositions of selective assets into new state-of-the-art development and acquisition opportunities with higher cash flow and rates of return;


• | execute on our development projects under construction and future development pipeline, including expanding entitlements; and


• | evaluate redevelopment opportunities in supply-constrained markets because such efforts generally achieve similar returns to new development with reduced entitlement risk and shorter construction periods.

We may engage in the additional development or redevelopment of office and mixed-use properties when market conditions support a favorable risk-adjusted return on such development or redevelopment. We expect that our significant working relationships with tenants, municipalities and landowners on the West Coast will give us further access to development and redevelopment opportunities. We cannot ensure that we will be able to successfully develop or redevelop any of our properties or that we will have access to additional development or redevelopment opportunities.
 8

Acquisition Strategies.    We believe we are well positioned to acquire opportunistic properties and development and redevelopment opportunities as the result of our extensive experience, strong financial position and ability to access capital. We continue to focus on growth opportunities in West Coast markets populated by knowledge and creative based tenants in a variety of industries, including technology, media, healthcare, life sciences, entertainment and professional services. Against the backdrop of market volatility, we expect to manage a strong balance sheet, execute on our development program and selectively evaluate opportunities that add immediate Net Operating Income to our portfolio or play a strategic role in our future growth and that:

• | provide attractive yields and significant potential for growth in cash flow from property operations;


• | present growth opportunities in our existing or other strategic markets; and


• | demonstrate the potential for improved performance through intensive management, repositioning, capital investment and leasing that should result in increased occupancy and rental revenues.

Financing Strategies.    Our financing policies and objectives are determined by our board of directors. Our goal is to limit our dependence on leverage and maintain a conservative ratio of debt-to-total market capitalization. As of December 31, 2018, our total debt as a percentage of total market capitalization was 31.4%, which was calculated based on the quoted closing price per share of the Company’s common stock of $62.88 on December 31, 2018 (see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Company —Capitalization” for additional information). Our financing strategies include:

• | maintaining financial flexibility, including a low secured to unsecured debt ratio;


• | maximizing our ability to access a variety of both public and private capital sources;


• | maintaining a staggered debt maturity schedule in which the maturity dates of our debt are spread over several years to limit risk exposure at any particular point in the capital and credit market cycles;


• | completing financing in advance of the need for capital;


• | managing interest rate exposure by generally maintaining a greater amount of fixed-rate debt as compared to variable-rate debt; and


• | maintaining our credit ratings.

We utilize multiple sources of capital, including borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility, unsecured term loan facility, proceeds from the issuance of public or private debt or equity securities and other bank and/or institutional borrowings and our capital recycling program, including strategic venture sources. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain capital as needed on terms favorable to us or at all. (See the discussion under the caption “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —Factors That May Influence Future Results of Operations” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”)
Sustainability Strategies. We make excellence in sustainability a core competence by:

• | managing our properties to offer the maximum degree of utility and operational efficiency to our tenants. We offer tenant sustainability programs focused on helping our tenants reduce their energy and water consumption and increase their recycling diversion rates. Many of our assets are in zones that have been impacted by drought and, as such, face the risk of increased water costs and fines for high consumption. We endeavor to mitigate these risks through comprehensive, proactive water reduction efforts throughout our portfolio, including domestic fixture upgrades, cooling tower optimizations, a comprehensive leak detection program and irrigation systems retrofits. We also incorporate green lease language into 100% of our new leases, including a cost recovery clause for resource-efficiency related capital expenditures in full-service gross leases, which seek to align tenant and landlord interests on energy, water and waste efficiency. Green leases (also known as aligned leases, high performance leases or energy efficient leases) aim to align the financial and energy incentives of building owners and tenants so they can work together to save money, conserve resources 

 9

and ensure the efficient operation of buildings. We were honored in 2014 to be part of the inaugural class of Green Lease Leaders, the Institute for Market Transformation’s (“IMT’s”) program to encourage green leasing in real estate. In 2016, IMT honored us again with two Green Lease Leaders Team Transaction awards, and we earned an additional Green Lease Leaders Award at the Gold level in 2018.

• | building our current development projects to Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (“LEED”) specifications. All of our office development projects are now designed to achieve LEED certification, either LEED Platinum or Gold. 


• | actively pursuing LEED certification for approximately 1.3 million square feet of office space under construction. In addition, an analysis of energy performance is included in our standard due diligence process for acquisitions, and reducing energy use year over year is a comprehensive goal of our operational strategy. This is accomplished through systematic energy auditing, mechanical, lighting and other building upgrades, optimizing operations and engaging tenants. During the past few years, we have significantly enhanced the sustainability profile of our portfolio, ending 2018 with 63% of our properties LEED certified and 79% of our properties ENERGY STAR certified (in each case as a percentage of our total rentable square feet as of December 31, 2018). During 2018, the Company was recognized for our sustainability efforts with multiple industry leadership awards, including NAREIT’s 2018 Office Leader in the Light Award for the fifth consecutive year, and in 2018 it won NAREIT’s Most Innovative Leader in the Light Award as well. In addition, the Company was recognized with the ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Sustained Excellence Award for the fifth time. The Company was also recognized by GRESB as the North American sustainability leader in the listed office sector, and we continue to be listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index. 


• | identifying climate change as a risk to our business, an opportunity for long-term value creation and a key driver in long-term strategic business decisions. These risks and opportunities include policy, market, technology and reputational concerns and are a focus area for the Board and management. Climate-related risks and opportunities are governed by the Board through the Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability Committee (the “Committee”). In 2018, the Committee endorsed the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) and tasked management with assessing and reporting against climate related risk for the Company. Recognizing the importance of reducing the Company’s greenhouse gas impact on the environment, we have committed to achieving carbon neutral operations by December 31, 2020. This means that the entirety of our scope 1 and scope 2 emissions will be offset by this date through a combination of energy efficiency measures and both onsite and offsite renewables. This exceeds our carbon reduction goals previously validated by Science-Based Targets. Science-Based Targets is a collaboration between the Carbon Disclosure Project, the United Nations Global Compact, the World Resources Institute and the World Wide Fund for Nature, which independently assesses and approves the carbon reduction goals of companies.

Significant Tenants
As of December 31, 2018, our 15 largest tenants in terms of annualized base rental revenues represented approximately 45.7% of our total annualized base rental revenues, defined as annualized monthly contractual rents from existing tenants as of December 31, 2018. Annualized base rental revenue includes the impact of straight-lining rent escalations and the amortization of free rent periods and excludes the impact of the following: amortization of deferred revenue related tenant-funded tenant improvements, amortization of above/below market rents, amortization for lease incentives due under existing leases and expense reimbursement revenue.
For further information on our 15 largest tenants and the composition of our tenant base, see “Item 2. Properties —Significant Tenants.”
Competition
We compete with several developers, owners, operators and acquirers of office, undeveloped land and other commercial real estate, including mixed-use and residential real estate, many of which own properties similar to ours in the same submarkets in which our properties are located. For further discussion of the potential impact of competitive conditions on our business, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Segment and Geographic Financial Information 
During 2018 and 2017, we had one reportable segment, our office properties segment. For information about our office property revenues and long-lived assets and other financial information, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —Results of Operations.”
As of December 31, 2018, all of our properties and development projects were owned and all of our business was conducted in the state of California with the exception of eight office properties and one development project under construction located in the state of Washington. As of December 31, 2018, all of our properties and development projects were 100% owned, excluding four office properties owned by three consolidated property partnerships and a property held in a VIE to facilitate a Section 1031 Exchange that closed in January 2019, which have been consolidated for financial reporting purposes (see Note 2 “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for further information).
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed 276 people through the Operating Partnership, Kilroy Services, LLC, and Kilroy Realty TRS, Inc. We believe that relations with our employees are good.
Environmental Regulations and Potential Liabilities
Government Regulations Relating to the Environment.    Many laws and governmental regulations relating to the environment are applicable to our properties, and changes in these laws and regulations, or their interpretation by agencies and the courts, occur frequently and may adversely affect us.

Existing conditions at some of our properties.    Independent environmental consultants have conducted Phase I or similar environmental site assessments on all of our properties. We generally obtain these assessments prior to the acquisition of a property and may later update them as required for subsequent financing of the property, if a property is slated for disposition, or as requested by a tenant. Consultants are required to perform Phase I assessments to American Society for Testing and Materials standards then-existing for Phase I site assessments and typically include a historical review, a public records review, a visual inspection of the surveyed site, and the issuance of a written report. These assessments do not generally include any soil or groundwater sampling or subsurface investigations; however, if a Phase I does recommend that soil or groundwater samples be taken or other subsurface investigations take place, we generally perform such recommended actions. Depending on the age of the property, the Phase I may have included an assessment of asbestos-containing materials or a separate hazardous materials survey may have been conducted. 
 12

For properties where asbestos-containing materials were identified or suspected, an operations and maintenance plan was generally prepared and implemented.
Historical operations at or near some of our properties, including the presence of underground or above ground storage tanks, various sites uses that involved hazardous substances, the landfilling of hazardous substances and solid waste, and migration of contamination from other sites, may have caused soil or groundwater contamination. In some instances, the prior owners of the affected properties conducted remediation of known contamination in the soils on our properties, we are required to conduct further environmental clean-up and environmental closure activities at certain properties, and residual contamination could pose environmental, health, and safety risks if not appropriately addressed. We may need to investigate or remediate contaminated soil, soil gas, landfill gas, and groundwater, and we may also need to conduct landfill closure and post-closure activities, including, for example, the implementation of groundwater and methane monitoring systems and impervious cover, and the costs of such work could exceed projected or budgeted amounts. To protect the health and safety of site occupants and others, we may be required to implement and operate safeguards, including, for example, vapor intrusion mitigation systems and building protection systems to address methane. We may need to modify our methods of construction or face increased construction costs as a result of environmental conditions, and we may face obligations under agreements with governmental authorities with respect to the management of such environmental conditions. If releases from our sites migrate offsite, or if our site redevelopment activities cause or contribute to a migration of hazardous substances, neighbors or others could make claims against us, such as for property damage, personal injury, or cost recovery. 
As of December 31, 2018, we had accrued environmental remediation liabilities of approximately $83.2 million recorded on our consolidated balance sheets in connection with certain of our in-process and future development projects. The accrued environmental remediation liabilities represent the costs we estimate we will incur when we perform environmental clean-up and closure activities and commence development at various development acquisition sites. These estimates, which we developed with the assistance of third party experts, consist primarily of the removal of contaminated soil, performing environmental closure activities, constructing remedial systems and other related costs since we are required to dispose of any existing contaminated soil, and sometimes perform other environmental closure or remedial activities, when we develop new buildings at these sites. It is possible that we could incur additional environmental remediation costs in connection with these development projects.  However, potential additional environmental costs cannot be reasonably estimated at this time and certain changes in estimates could occur as the site conditions, final project timing, design elements, actual soil conditions and other aspects of the projects, which may depend upon municipal and other approvals beyond the control of the Company, are determined. See Note 18 “Commitments and Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information. 
Other than the accrued environmental liabilities recorded in connection with certain of our development projects, we are not aware of any such condition, liability, or concern by any other means that would give rise to material environmental liabilities. However, our assessments may have failed to reveal all environmental conditions, liabilities, or compliance concerns; there may be material environmental conditions, liabilities, or compliance concerns that arose at a property after the review was completed; future laws, ordinances, or regulations may impose material additional environmental liability; and environmental conditions at our properties may be affected in the future by tenants, third parties, or the condition of land or operations near our properties, such as the presence of underground storage tanks or migrating plumes. We cannot be certain that costs of future environmental compliance will not have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, the quoted trading price of our securities, and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to security holders.
Use of hazardous materials by some of our tenants.    Some of our tenants handle hazardous substances and wastes on our properties as part of their routine operations. Environmental laws and regulations may subject these tenants, and potentially us, to liability resulting from such activities. We generally require our tenants in their leases to comply with these environmental laws and regulations and to indemnify us for any related liabilities. As of December 31, 2018, other than routine cleaning materials, approximately 4-6% of our tenants handled hazardous substances and/or wastes on approximately 1-3% of the aggregate square footage of our properties as part of their routine operations. These tenants are primarily involved in the life sciences business. The hazardous substances and wastes are primarily comprised of diesel fuel for emergency generators and small quantities of lab and light manufacturing chemicals including, but not limited to, alcohol, ammonia, carbon dioxide, cryogenic gases, dichlorophenol, methane, naturalyte

acid, nitrogen, nitrous oxide, and oxygen which are routinely used by life science companies. We are not aware of any material noncompliance, liability, or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products in connection with any of our properties, and management does not believe that on-going activities by our tenants will have a material adverse effect on our operations.
Costs related to government regulation and private litigation over environmental matters.    Under applicable environmental laws and regulations, we may be liable for the costs of removal, remediation, or disposal of certain hazardous or toxic substances present or released on our properties. These laws could impose liability without regard to whether we are responsible for, or even knew of, the presence or release of the hazardous materials. Government investigations and remediation actions may have substantial costs, and the presence or release of hazardous substances on a property could result in governmental clean-up actions, personal injury actions, or similar claims by private plaintiffs.
Potential environmental liabilities may exceed our environmental insurance coverage limits, transactional indemnities or holdbacks.    We carry what we believe to be commercially reasonable environmental insurance. Our environmental insurance policies are subject to various terms, conditions and exclusions. Similarly, in connection with some transactions we obtain environmental indemnities and holdbacks that may not be honored by the indemnitors, may be less than the resulting liabilities or may otherwise fail to address the liabilities adequately. Therefore, we cannot provide any assurance that our insurance coverage or transactional indemnities will be sufficient or that our liability, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, quoted trading price of our securities, and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to security holders.
Litigation
Lawsuits have been filed in San Francisco County Superior Court in connection with the vertical and differential settlement experienced at the Millennium Tower property located at 301 Mission Street in San Francisco, California, a building not owned by the Company but located in proximity to the Company’s property located at 350 Mission Street.  Among the claims asserted in the complex lawsuits are claims that acts by various entities, including entities affiliated with other neighboring properties, contributed to the settlement that Millennium Tower has experienced. In October 2017, two defendants named in the lawsuits asserted cross-claims for equitable indemnification against certain of the Company’s entities in connection with the development and construction-related activities at our neighboring 350 Mission Street property.  One of those parties has voluntarily dismissed its cross-claims against the Company’s entities. We dispute the allegations and intend to vigorously defend against these claims.
