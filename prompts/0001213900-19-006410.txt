ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
Unless the context indicates otherwise, all references in this Annual Report to the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Sincerity Applied Materials Holdings Corp. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Sincerity Australia Pty Ltd.
 
DESCRIPTION OF OUR BUSINESS
 
Organizational History
 
We were incorporated as HapyKidz.com, Inc. in Nevada on July 28, 2011 with the intention to become an e-commerce marketplace that connects merchants to consumers by offering daily discounts on goods and services through a proprietary website. We were not successful in this endeavor.
 
On September 4, 2013, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation with the Nevada Secretary of State to change our name from HapyKidz.com, Inc. to Symbid Corp.
 
On December 6, 2013, we closed a share exchange (the “Share Exchange”) pursuant to which the 19 shareholders of Symbid Holding B.V. sold all of their capital stock in Symbid Holding B.V. to us in exchange for 352,834 shares of our common stock, $0.001 par value per share (the “Common Stock”). As a result of the Share Exchange, Symbid Holding B.V. became a wholly owned subsidiary of ours.
 
As the result of the Share Exchange, we were engaged in the business of creating and operating online, equity based crowdfunding platforms, through our wholly owned subsidiary, Symbid Holding B.V. Commencing in 2015, we expanded our operations to include an online platform for small and medium sized enterprise funding, connecting new and traditional sources of finance in one integrated network built around our technology.
 
The Share Exchange was treated as a recapitalization of the Company for financial accounting purposes and Symbid Holding B.V. was considered the acquiror for accounting purposes.
 
In accordance with “reverse acquisition” accounting treatment, our historical financial statements as of period ends, and for periods ended, prior to the Share Exchange were replaced with the historical financial statements of Symbid Holding B.V. prior to the Share Exchange in our post Share Exchange filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
 
Due to cash flow problems, during the fourth quarter of 2016, we were forced to restructure the Company, curtail certain business operations and change our focus from the operation of online funding platforms and the provision of software solutions for alternative financing in the small and medium enterprise market to the licensing of software packages for which we own or license the intellectual property.
 
On June 8, 2017, we dissolved our direct, wholly owned subsidiary, Symbid Holding B.V. and our indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, Symbid B.V. and FAC B.V. At the time of dissolution, none of these entities had any material assets or operations and none of these entities were generating revenues. Following such dissolutions, we had no subsidiaries.
 
On June 9, 2017, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation with the Nevada Secretary of State to change our name to Sincerity Applied Materials Holdings Corp. and effected a 60:1 reverse stock split on our Common Stock. The name change and revenue stock split took effect on the over-the-counter market at the open of business on June 14, 2017, at which time our Common Stock began to trade on a post-split basis under the symbol “SBIDD”. Our Common Stock began trading under the Symbol “SINC” on July 13, 2017. The Reverse Split and the Name Change were approved by our board of directors on May 1, 2017 and by stockholders holding 80% of our outstanding voting stock on May 1, 2017 as further described in our Definitive Information Statement on Schedule 14C which we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 4, 2017 and mailed to our stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 1, 2017.

On September 19, 2017 we acquired Sincerity Australia Pty Ltd., an Australia corporation (“SAPL”) pursuant to the closing under a June 5, 2017 Acquisition Agreement as amended on July 7, 2017, July 21, 2017, August 15, 2017, August 23, 2017, September 1, 2017 and September 15, 2017 (the “Acquisition Agreement”) among the Company, SAPL and the sole shareholder/member of SAPL (the “SAPL Shareholder”). Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement and the acquisition completed thereunder (the “Acquisition”) we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of SAPL consisting of 10,000 Ordinary Shares (the “Ordinary Shares”) from the SAPL Shareholder in exchange for 45,211,047 shares (the “Acquisition Shares”) of our Common Stock making SAPL a wholly owned subsidiary of ours. At the time of the closing under the Acquisition Agreement, SAPL had no outstanding securities other than the Ordinary Shares. The issuance of shares of our common stock in the Acquisition was exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act.
 
As a result of the Acquisition, we acquired the business of SAPL and have continued the existing business operations of SAPL as a publicly-traded company under the name Sincerity Applied Materials Holdings Corp.
 
Prior to the Acquisition, we were a “shell company” (as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act). As a result of the Acquisition, we ceased to be a “shell company”.
 
On November 13, 2018, we effected a 1000:1 reverse stock split of our common stock. Unless otherwise indicated, references to share amounts in this report give retroactive effect to the 1000:1 reverse split.
 
Implications of Being a Smaller Reporting Company
 
We qualify as a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and have elected to take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosure available to smaller reporting companies.
Our Corporate Information
 
Our corporate headquarters are located at 4 Avoca Street, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia 3141 and our telephone number is +61-421-007-277. Our filings with the Securities Exchange Commission, or SEC, are available free of charge through the SEC website.
Overview
 
We are a supplier of technologically advanced plastics and other solutions for the packaging industry and other industries primarily serving major end users and distributors in Australia, Asia and the Middle East. Our products have applications in the areas of packaging, agriculture, automotive and transportation, paint and coating, construction, personal care and hygiene, electronics, pharmaceutical, energy and natural resources, plastics and rubber and leather. Our principal products are high quality, breathable plastic film and modified atmosphere packaging used in the packaging of perishable foods.
 
In 2016, we established a relationship with the Visyboard Group (“Visy”), a global manufacturer of a wide range of packaging products including corrugated, plastic film and containers and aluminum. Visy has annual sales in excess of US$ 6 billion and operations in the U.S., Europe, Asia and Australia. Visy is Australia’s largest packaging reseller and manufacturer and has 24 plants and facilities in Australia. Visy has traditionally focused on converted packaging and extruded plastics. With increasing consumer attention on fresh food and durables as well as environmental impact of discarded packaging, Visy is seeking to build its market share in the manufacture and supply of fresh food packaging.
 
Our platform whereby plastic film production lines utilize micro laser technology to adjust the flow of oxygen and other gases to correspond with the different requirements of fresh produce has a significant impact in extending the shelf life of the product, often by several weeks. Shelf life is becoming a critical issue for exporters, wholesalers and most importantly, retailers

In addition to the plastic film business, we expect to increase our supply of extruded plastic pallets for aluminum cans to Visy which operates the largest aluminum recycling business in Australia. We are also serving Visy’s selling agent in the export of up to 100,000 tons per annum of PET plastics from Australia to China for recycling.
 
Directors and Officers
 
Our sole director Yiwen Zhang was appointed upon the closing of the September 19, 2017 Acquisition.

Yiwen Zhang serves as our President and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Lim as our Chief Financial Officer and Eter Huang as our Treasurer. Yiwen Zhang is our principal executive officer and Chris Lim is our principal financial and accounting officer for SEC reporting purposes.

See “Management-Directors and Executive Officers” below for information about our directors and executive officers.
 
Employee
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had one employee and two consultants.
 
Lock-up Agreements and Other Restrictions
 
In connection with the Acquisition, the SAPL Shareholder ( the “Restricted Holder”), entered into a lock-up agreement, (the “Lock-Up Agreements”), whereby it is restricted for a period of twenty-four months after the Acquisition (the “restricted Period”), from certain sales or dispositions (including pledges) of all of our Common Stock held by (or issuable to) it, such restrictions together referred to as the Lock-Up. The foregoing restrictions do not apply to the resale of shares of Common Stock by the Restricted Holder in any registered secondary offering of equity securities by us (and, if such offering is underwritten, with the written consent of the lead or managing underwriter), or to certain other transfers customarily excepted.
 
In addition, the Restricted Holder agreed, for a period of 12 months following the Closing Date, that it will not, directly or indirectly, effect or agree to effect any short sale (as defined in Rule 200 under Regulation SHO of the Exchange Act), whether or not against the box, establish any “put equivalent position” (as defined in Rule 16a-1(h) under the Exchange Act) with respect to the Common Stock, borrow or pre-borrow any shares of Common Stock, or grant any other right (including, without limitation, any put or call option) with respect to the Common Stock or with respect to any security that includes, relates to or derives any significant part of its value from the Common Stock or otherwise seek to hedge its position in the Common Stock.
