The ITW Business Model
The powerful and highly differentiated ITW Business Model is the Company’s core source of value creation. This business model is the Company’s competitive advantage and defines how ITW creates value for its shareholders and comprises three unique elements:

• | ITW’s 80/20 Front-to-Back process is the operating system that is applied in every ITW business. Initially introduced as a manufacturing efficiency tool in the 1980s, ITW has continually refined, improved and expanded 80/20 into a proprietary, holistic business management process that generates significant value for the Company and its customers. Through the application of data driven insights generated by 80/20 practice, ITW focuses on its largest and best opportunities (the “80”) and eliminates cost, complexity and distractions associated with the less profitable opportunities (the “20”). 80/20 enables ITW businesses to consistently achieve world-class operational excellence in product availability, quality, and innovation, while generating superior financial performance;


• | Customer-back Innovation has fueled decades of profitable growth at ITW. The Company’s unique innovation approach is built on insight gathered from the 80/20 Front-to-Back process. Working from the customer back, ITW businesses position themselves as the go-to problem solver for their “80” customers. ITW’s innovation efforts are focused on understanding customer needs, particularly those in “80” markets with solid long-term growth fundamentals, and subsequently creating unique solutions to address those needs. These customer insights and learnings drive innovation at ITW and have contributed to a portfolio of approximately 18,000 granted and pending patents;

• | ITW’s Decentralized, Entrepreneurial Culture enables ITW businesses to be fast, focused, and responsive. ITW businesses have significant flexibility within the framework of the ITW Business Model to customize their approach in order to best serve their specific customers' needs. ITW colleagues recognize their unique responsibilities to execute the Company's strategy and values. As a result, the Company maintains a focused and simple organizational structure that, combined with outstanding execution, delivers best-in-class services and solutions adapted to each business' customers and end markets.

Enterprise Strategy
In late 2012, ITW began its strategic framework transitioning the Company on its current path to fully leverage the compelling performance potential of the ITW Business Model. Since then, ITW has made considerable progress in its path to full potential.
The roots of ITW’s Enterprise Strategy began in late 2011 / early 2012, when the Company undertook a complete review of its performance. Focusing on its businesses delivering consistent above-market growth with best-in-class margins and returns, ITW developed a strategy to replicate that performance across its operations.
Based on this rigorous evaluation, ITW determined that solid and consistent above-market organic growth must be the core growth engine to deliver world-class financial performance and compelling long-term returns for its shareholders. To shift its primary growth engine to organic, the Company began executing a multi-step approach.

• | The first step was to narrow the focus and improve the quality of ITW’s business portfolio. As part of the Portfolio Management initiative, ITW exited businesses that were operating in commoditized market spaces and prioritized sustainable differentiation as a must-have requirement for all ITW businesses. This process included both divesting entire businesses and exiting commoditized product lines and customers inside otherwise highly differentiated ITW divisions.

As a result of this work, ITW’s business portfolio now has significantly higher organic growth potential. ITW segments and divisions now possess attractive and differentiated product lines and end markets as they continue to improve operating margins and generate price/cost increases. The Company achieved this through product line simplification, or eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers, while supporting and growing the businesses’ largest / most profitable customers and product lines. 

• | Step two, Business Structure Simplification, was implemented to simplify and scale-up ITW’s operating structure to support increased engineering, marketing, and sales resources, and, at the same time, improve global reach and competitiveness, all of which were critical to driving accelerated organic growth. ITW now has 87 scaled-up divisions with significantly enhanced focus on growth investments, core customers and products, and customer-back innovation.


• | The Strategic Sourcing initiative established sourcing as a core strategic and operational capability at ITW. The Company’s 80/20-enabled sourcing organization has delivered an average of one percent reduction in spend each year from 2013 through 2018 and is on track to do the same in 2019.


• | With the initial portfolio realignment and scale-up work largely complete, the Company has shifted its focus to preparing for and accelerating organic growth, reapplying the 80/20 Front-to-Back process to optimize its newly scaled-up divisions for growth, first, to build a foundation of operational excellence, and second, to identify the best opportunities to drive organic growth.

ITW has clearly demonstrated superior 80/20 management, resulting in meaningful incremental improvement in margins and returns as evidenced by the Company’s operating margin and after-tax return on invested capital. At the same time, these 80/20 initiatives can also result in restructuring initiatives that reduce costs and improve profitability and returns.

Path to Full Potential - Finishing the Job
Since the launch of the enterprise strategy, the Company has made considerable progress to position itself to reach full potential. The ITW Business Model and unique set of capabilities are a source of strong and enduring competitive advantage, but for the Company to truly reach its full potential over the next five years, every one of its divisions must also be operating at its full potential. To do so, the Company remains focused on three key areas to finish the job of positioning ITW to perform to its full potential:

• | Portfolio discipline


• | 80/20 Front-to-Back practice excellence


• | Full-potential organic growth

Portfolio Discipline
The Company only operates in industries where it can generate significant, long-term competitive advantage from the ITW Business Model. ITW businesses have the right “raw material” in terms of market and business attributes that best fit the ITW Business Model and have significant potential to drive above-market organic growth over the long-term.
The Company focuses on high-quality businesses, ensuring it operates in markets with positive long-term macro fundamentals and with customers that have critical needs and value ITW's differentiated products, services and solutions. ITW’s portfolio operates in diverse end markets and geographies which makes the Company more resilient in the face of uncertain or volatile market environments.
80/20 Front-to-Back Practice Excellence
The 80/20 Front-to-Back process is a rigorous, iterative and highly data-driven approach to identify where the Company has true differentiation and the ability to drive sustainable, high-quality organic growth. The Company simplifies and eliminates complexity and redesigns every aspect of its business to ensure focused execution on key opportunities, markets, customers, and products. ITW will continue its efforts to drive 80/20 Front-to-Back practice excellence in every division in the Company, every day.
Full-potential Organic Growth
Reaching full potential means that every division is positioned for sustainable, high-quality organic growth. The Company has clearly defined action plans aimed at leveraging the performance power of the ITW Business Model to achieve full-potential organic growth in every division. At the same time, the Company consistently reviews its portfolio, assesses businesses that are growth-challenged and evaluates if further portfolio refinements may be needed. The Company is currently exploring options, including potential divestitures, for certain businesses with revenues totaling up to $1 billion. If a decision is made to divest any of these businesses, the Company expects that earnings per share dilution would be offset by incremental share repurchases.
Divestiture Activity
Divestiture of the Industrial Packaging Segment— In February 2013, the Company announced that it was initiating a review process to explore strategic alternatives for the Industrial Packaging segment. In September 2013, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a plan to commence a sale process for the Industrial Packaging segment. The Company classified the Industrial Packaging segment as held for sale beginning in the third quarter of 2013 and no longer presented this segment as part of its continuing operations. 
On February 6, 2014, the Company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to sell the Industrial Packaging business to The Carlyle Group for $3.2 billion. The transaction was completed on May 1, 2014, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $1.7 billion ($1.1 billion after-tax) in the second quarter of 2014 which was included in Income from discontinued operations.

Distribution Methods
The Company’s businesses primarily distribute their products directly to industrial manufacturers and through independent distributors.
Backlog
Backlog generally is not considered a significant factor in the Company’s businesses as relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover are characteristic of most of their products. Backlog by segment as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was as follows:

In millions | 2018 | | 2017
Automotive OEM | $ | 500 | | | $ | 462 
Food & Equipment | 215 | | | 204 | 
Test & Measurement and Electronics | 378 | | | 342 | 
Welding | 93 | | | 90 | 
Polymers & Fluids | 67 | | | 57 | 
Construction Products | 30 | | | 39 | 
Specialty Products | 280 | | | 243 | 
Total | $ | 1,563 | | | $ | 1,437

Due to the predominately short term nature of the Company's arrangements with its customers, backlog orders scheduled for shipment beyond calendar year 2019 were not material as of December 31, 2018.
Competition
With operations in 55 countries, the Company offers a wide range of products in a myriad of markets, many of which are fragmented, and the Company encounters a variety of competitors that vary by product line, end market and geographic area. The Company's competitors include many regional or specialized companies, as well as large U.S. and non-U.S. companies or divisions of large companies. Each of the Company's segments generally has several main competitors and numerous smaller ones in most of their end markets and geographic areas. In addition to numerous smaller regional competitors, the Welding segment competes globally with Lincoln Electric and ESAB.
In virtually all segments, the Company differentiates its businesses from its competitors based on product innovation, product quality, brand preference and service delivery. Technical capability is also a competitive factor in most segments. The Company believes that each segment's primary competitive advantages derive from the Company's business model and decentralized operating structure, which creates a strong focus on end markets and customers at the local level, enabling its businesses to respond rapidly to market dynamics. This structure enables the Company's businesses to drive operational excellence utilizing the Company's 80/20 Front-to-Back process and leveraging its product innovation capabilities. The Company also believes that its global footprint is a competitive advantage in many of its markets, especially in its Automotive OEM segment.
Raw Materials
The Company uses raw materials of various types, primarily steel, resins and chemicals, that are available from numerous commercial sources. The availability of materials and energy has not resulted in any significant business interruptions or other major problems, and no such problems are currently anticipated.
Intellectual Property
The Company owns approximately 3,500 unexpired U.S. patents and 8,400 foreign patents covering articles, methods and machines. In addition, the Company has approximately 1,500 applications for patents pending in the U.S. Patent Office and 4,200 applications pending in foreign patent offices. There is no assurance that any of these patents will be issued. The Company maintains a patent group for the administration of patents and processing of patent applications.

The Company believes that many of its patents are valuable and important; however, the expiration of any one of the Company's patents would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations or financial position. The Company also credits its success in the markets it serves to engineering capability; manufacturing techniques; skills and efficiency; marketing and sales promotion; and service and delivery of quality products to its customers.
In addition to patents, many of the Company's products and services are sold under various owned or licensed trademarks, which are important to the Company in the aggregate. Some of the Company's more significant trademarks include ITW, which is also used in conjunction with the trademarks of many of the Company's businesses; Deltar and Shakeproof in the Automotive OEM segment; Hobart in the Food Equipment segment; Instron in the Test & Measurement and Electronics segment; Miller in the Welding segment; Rain-X and Permatex in the Polymers & Fluids segment; Paslode in the Construction Products segment; and Hi-Cone in the Specialty Products segment.
Environmental
The Company believes that its manufacturing plants and equipment are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental regulations. Additional measures to maintain compliance are not expected to materially affect the Company’s capital expenditures, competitive position, financial position or results of operations.
Various legislative and administrative regulations concerning environmental issues have become effective or are under consideration in many parts of the world relating to manufacturing processes and the sale or use of certain products. To date, such developments have not had a substantial adverse impact on the Company's revenues, earnings or cash flows. 
Employees
The Company employed approximately 48,000 people as of December 31, 2018 and considers its employee relations to be excellent.
