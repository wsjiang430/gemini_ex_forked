Structure 
 Star Group, L.P. (“Star” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a home heating oil and propane distributor and services provider with one reportable operating segment that principally provides heating related services to residential and commercial customers. At a special meeting of unitholders held on October 25, 2017, our unitholders voted in favor of proposals to have the Company elect to be treated as a corporation, instead of a partnership, for federal income tax purposes (commonly referred to as a “check-the-box election”), along with amendments to our partnership agreement to effect such changes in income tax classification, in each case effective November 1, 2017. In addition, the Company changed its name, effective October 25, 2017, from “Star Gas Partners, L.P.” to “Star Group, L.P.” to more closely align our name with the scope of our product and service offerings. For tax years after December 31, 2017, unitholders will receive a Form 1099-DIV and will not receive a Schedule K-1 as in previous tax years. Our legal structure will remain a Delaware limited partnership and the distribution provisions under our limited partnership agreement, including the incentive distribution structure will remain unchanged. As of November 30, 2019, we had outstanding 47.2 million common partner units (NYSE: “SGU”) representing a 99.3% limited partner interest in Star, and 0.3 million general partner units, representing a 0.7% general partner interest in Star.

Legal Structure 
 The following chart summarizes our structure as of September 30, 2019. 
 
Business Overview 
 We are a home heating oil and propane distributor and service provider to residential and commercial customers who heat their homes and buildings in the Northeast, Central and Southeast U.S. regions. Our customers are concentrated in the northern and eastern states. As of September 30, 2019, we sold home heating oil and propane to approximately 453,000 full service residential and commercial customers and 56,000 customers on a delivery only basis.  Approximately 236,000 of these customers, or 46%, are located in the New York City metropolitan area.  We believe we are the largest retail distributor of home heating oil in the United States, based upon sales volume with a market share in excess of 5.5%. We also sell gasoline and diesel fuel to approximately 27,000 customers. We install, maintain, and repair heating and air conditioning equipment and to a lesser extent provide these services outside our heating oil and propane customer base including 17,000 service contracts for natural gas and other heating systems. During fiscal 2019, total sales were comprised approximately 63% from sales of home heating oil and propane, 21% from other petroleum products, the majority of which is diesel and gasoline, and 16% from the installation and repair of heating and air conditioning equipment and ancillary services. We provide home heating equipment repair service and natural gas service 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week, 52 weeks a year. These services are an integral part of our business, and are intended to maximize customer satisfaction and loyalty. 
 We conduct our business through an operating subsidiary, Petro Holdings, Inc., utilizing multiple local brand names, such as Petro Home Services, Meenan, and Griffith Energy Services, Inc. 
 We also offer several pricing alternatives to our residential home heating oil customers, including a variable price (market based) option and a price-protected option, the latter of which either sets the maximum price or a fixed price that a customer will pay. Users choose the plan they feel best suits them which we believe increases customer satisfaction. Approximately 95% of our full service residential and commercial home heating oil customers automatically receive deliveries based on prevailing weather conditions. In addition, approximately 34% of our residential customers take advantage of our “smart pay” budget payment plan under which their estimated annual oil and propane deliveries and service billings are paid for in a series of equal monthly installments. We use derivative instruments as needed to mitigate our exposure to market risk associated with our price-protected offerings and the storing of our physical home heating oil inventory. Given our size, we are able to realize certain benefits of scale and provide consistent, strong customer service. 
 Currently, we have heating oil and/or propane customers in the following states: Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, 
 5

Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.
 
Industry Characteristics 
 Home heating oil is primarily used as a source of fuel to heat residences and businesses in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. According to the U.S. Department of Energy—Energy Information Administration, Residential Energy Consumption Survey (released May 2018), these regions account for 83% (4.8 million of 5.8 million) of the households in the United States where heating oil is the main space-heating fuel and 23% (4.7 million of 20.4 million) of the homes in these regions use home heating oil as their main space-heating fuel. Our experience has been that customers have a tendency to increase their conservation efforts as the price of home heating oil increases, thereby reducing their consumption. 
 The retail home heating oil industry is mature, with total market demand expected to decline in the foreseeable future due to conversions to natural gas, availability of other alternative energy sources and the installations of more fuel efficient heating systems. Therefore, our ability to maintain our business or grow within the industry is dependent on the acquisition of other retail distributors, the success of our marketing programs, and the growth of our other service offerings. Based on our records, our customer conversions to natural gas have ranged between 1.2% and 1.6% per year over the last five years. We believe this may continue or increase as natural gas has become less expensive than home heating oil on an equivalent BTU basis.  Natural gas conversions reached a high of 2.4% in fiscal 2013.  In addition, there are legislative and regulatory efforts underway in several states seeking to encourage homeowners to expand the use of natural gas as a heating fuel or to encourage or require all-electric new construction. 
 The retail home heating oil industry is highly fragmented, characterized by a large number of relatively small, independently owned and operated local distributors. Some dealers provide full service, as we do, and others offer delivery only on a cash-on-delivery basis, which we also do to a significantly lesser extent. In addition, the industry is complex and costly due to regulations, working capital requirements, and the costs and risks of hedging for price protected customers. 
 Propane is a by-product of natural gas processing and petroleum refining. Propane use falls into three broad categories: residential and commercial applications; industrial applications; and agricultural uses. In the residential and commercial markets, propane is used primarily for space heating, water heating, clothes drying and cooking. Industrial customers use propane generally as a motor fuel to power over-the-road vehicles, forklifts and stationary engines, to fire furnaces, as a cutting gas and in other process applications. In the agricultural market, propane is primarily used for tobacco curing, crop drying, poultry breeding and weed control. 
 The retail propane distribution industry is highly competitive and is generally serviced by large multi-state full-service distributors and small local independent distributors. Like the home heating oil industry, each retail propane distribution provider operates in its own competitive environment because propane distributors typically reside in close proximity to their customers. In most retail propane distribution markets, customers can choose from multiple distributors based on the quality of customer service, safety, reputation and price. 
 It is common practice in our business to price our liquid products to customers based on a per gallon margin over wholesale costs. As a result, we believe distributors such as ourselves generally seek to maintain their per gallon margins by passing wholesale price increases through to customers, thus insulating their margins from the volatility in wholesale prices. However, distributors may be unable or unwilling to pass the entire product cost increases through to customers. In these cases, significant decreases in per gallon margins may result. The timing of cost pass-throughs can also significantly affect margins. (See Customers and Pricing for a discussion on our offerings). 
 Business Strategy 
 Our business strategy is to increase Adjusted EBITDA (See Item 6. Selected Historical Financial and Operating Data for a definition and history) and cash flow by effectively managing operations while growing and retaining our customer base as a retail distributor of home heating oil and propane and provider of related products and services. The key elements of this strategy include the following: 
 6

Pursue select acquisitions Our senior management team has developed expertise in identifying acquisition opportunities and integrating acquired customers into our operations. We focus on acquiring profitable companies within and outside our current footprint. 
 We actively pursue home heating oil only companies, propane companies, dual fuel (home heating oil and propane) companies and selectively target motor fuels acquisitions, especially where they are operating in the markets we currently serve. The focus for our acquisitions is both within our current footprint, as well as outside of such areas if the target company is of adequate size to sustain profitability as a stand-alone operation. We have used this strategy to expand into several states over the past five years. 
 Deliver superior customer service We are dedicated to consistently providing our customers with superior service and a positive customer experience to improve retention and drive additional revenue. We have established programs and conduct surveys to effectively measure customer satisfaction at certain brands. 
 We have deployed a customer relationship management solution at most of our larger brands. This allows us to provide a more consistent customer experience as our employees will have a 360 degree-view of each customer with easy access to key customer information and customized dashboards to track individual employee performance. 
 We have resources dedicated to training employees to provide superior and consistent service and enhance the customer experience. This effort is supported, reinforced and monitored by our local management teams. 
 Complimentary service offerings We are focused on expanding our service offerings. These offerings include, but are not limited to, the sales, service and installation of heating and air conditioning equipment, plumbing services, and standby home generators. In addition, we also repair and install natural gas heating systems. 
 Seasonality 
 Our fiscal year ends on September 30. All references to quarters and years respectively in this document are to fiscal quarters and years unless otherwise noted. The seasonal nature of our business results in the sale of approximately 30% of our volume of home heating oil and propane in the first fiscal quarter and 50% of our volume in the second fiscal quarter of each fiscal year, the peak heating season. Approximately 25% of our volume of motor fuel and other petroleum products is sold in each of the four fiscal quarters. We generally realize net income in our first and second fiscal quarters and net losses during our third and fourth fiscal quarters and we expect that the negative impact of seasonality on our third and fourth fiscal quarter operating results will continue. In addition, sales volume typically fluctuates from year to year in response to variations in weather, wholesale energy prices and other factors. 
Degree Day 
 A “degree day” is an industry measurement of temperature designed to evaluate energy demand and consumption. Degree days are based on how far the average daily temperature departs from 65°F. Each degree of temperature above 65°F is counted as one cooling degree day, and each degree of temperature below 65°F is counted as one heating degree day. Degree days are accumulated each day over the course of a year and can be compared to a monthly or a multi-year average to see if a month or a year was warmer or cooler than usual. Degree days are officially observed by the National Weather Service. 
 Every ten years, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (“NOAA”) computes and publishes average meteorological quantities, including the average temperature for the last 30 years by geographical location, and the corresponding degree days. The latest and most widely used data covers the years from 1981 to 2010. Our calculations of normal weather are based on these published 30 year averages for heating degree days, weighted by volume for the locations where we have existing operations. 
 Competition 
 Most of our operating locations compete with numerous distributors, primarily on the basis of price, reliability of service and response to customer needs. Each such location operates in its own competitive environment. 
 We compete with distributors offering a broad range of services and prices, from full-service distributors, such as ourselves, to those offering delivery only. As do many companies in our business, we provide home heating and 
 7

propane equipment repair service on a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week, 52 weeks a year basis. We believe that this level of service tends to help build customer loyalty. In some instances homeowners have formed buying cooperatives that seek a lower price than individual customers are otherwise able to obtain. Our business competes for retail customers with suppliers of alternative energy products, principally natural gas, propane (in the case of our home heating oil operations) and electricity. 
 Customer Attrition 
 We measure net customer attrition for our full service residential and commercial home heating oil and propane customers. Net customer attrition is the difference between gross customer losses and customers added through marketing efforts. Customers added through acquisitions are not included in the calculation of gross customer gains. However, additional customers that are obtained through marketing efforts at newly acquired businesses are included in these calculations. Customer attrition percentage calculations include customers added through acquisitions in the denominators of the calculations on a weighted average basis. Gross customer losses are the result of a number of factors, including price competition, move outs, credit losses and conversions to natural gas. (See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Customer Attrition.) 
Customers and Pricing 
 Home heating oil customers comprise 81.7% of our product customer base, with 13.2% devoted to propane and 5.1% devoted to motor fuel and other petroleum products. (During fiscal 2019 we sold 345.5 million gallons of home heating oil and propane and 167.4 million gallons of motor fuel and other petroleum products.)
 Our full service home heating oil customer base is comprised of 97% residential customers and 3% commercial customers. Approximately 95% of our full service residential and commercial home heating oil customers have their deliveries scheduled automatically and 5% of our home heating oil customer base call from time to time to schedule a delivery. Automatic deliveries are scheduled based on each customer’s historical consumption pattern and prevailing weather conditions. Our practice is to bill customers promptly after delivery. We offer a balanced payment plan to residential customers in which a customer’s estimated annual oil purchases and service contract fees are paid for in a series of equal monthly payments. Approximately 34% of our residential home heating oil customers have selected this billing option. 
 We offer several pricing alternatives to our residential home heating oil customers. Our variable pricing program allows the price to float with the heating oil market and other factors. In addition, we offer price-protected programs, which establish either a ceiling or a fixed price per gallon that the customer pays over a defined period. The following chart depicts the percentage of the pricing plans selected by our residential home heating oil customers as of the end of the fiscal year. 
 
 
 | September 30, | 
---------+---------------+------
 | 2019 | | | 2018 | | 2017 | 2016 | | | 2015 | 
Variable | | 53.9 | % | | 55.2 | % | 52.6 | % | | | 53.2 | % | 51.4 | %
Ceiling | | 39.1 | % | | 36.9 | % | 37.1 | % | | | 40.8 | % | 43.9 | %
Fixed | | 7.0 | % | | 7.9 | % | 10.3 | % | (a) | | 6.0 | % | 4.7 | %
 | | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | % | | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %


(a) | Approximately 2% of the increase in the percentage of accounts under fixed contracts is attributable to fiscal 2017 acquisitions.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Sales to residential customers ordinarily generate higher per gallon margins than sales to commercial customers. Due to greater price sensitivity, our own internal marketing efforts, and hedging costs of residential price-protected customers, the per gallon margins realized from price-protected customers generally are less than from variable priced residential customers. 
 8

The propane customer base has a similar profile of heating oil residential and commercial customers. Pricing plans chosen by propane customers are almost exclusively variable in nature where selling prices will float with the propane market and other commercial factors.   
 The motor fuel and other petroleum products customer group includes commercial and industrial customers of unbranded gasoline, diesel, kerosene and related distillate products.  We sell products to these customers through contracts of various terms or through a competitive bidding process.  
 Derivatives 
 We use derivative instruments in order to mitigate our exposure to market risk associated with the purchase of home heating oil for our price-protected customers, physical inventory on hand, inventory in transit, priced purchase commitments, and the variable interest rate on our term loan. Currently, the Company’s derivative instruments are with the following counterparties: Bank of America, N.A., Bank of Montreal, Cargill, Inc., Citibank, N.A., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Key Bank, N.A., Regions Financial Corporation, Toronto-Dominion Bank and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. 
 The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 815-10-05, Derivatives and Hedging, requires that derivative instruments be recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities. To the extent our interest rate derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are effective, as defined under this guidance, changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We have elected not to designate our commodity derivative instruments as hedging instruments under this guidance, and as a result, the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments during the holding period are recognized in our statement of operations. Therefore, we experience volatility in earnings as outstanding derivative instruments are marked to market and non-cash gains and losses are recorded prior to the sale of the commodity to the customer. The volatility in any given period related to unrealized non-cash gains or losses on derivative instruments can be significant to our overall results. However, we ultimately expect those gains and losses to be offset by the cost of product when purchased. Depending on the risk being hedged, realized gains and losses are recorded in cost of product, cost of installations and services, or delivery and branch expenses. 
 Suppliers and Supply Arrangements 
 We purchase our product for delivery in either barge, pipeline or truckload quantities, and as of September 30, 2019, had contracts with approximately 119 third-party terminal sites for the right to temporarily store petroleum products at their facilities. Home heating oil and propane purchases are made under supply contracts or on the spot market. We have entered into market price based contracts for approximately 83% of our expected home heating oil and propane requirements for the fiscal 2020 heating season. We also have market price based contracts for approximately 27% of our expected diesel and gasoline requirements for fiscal 2020. 
 No single supplier provided more than 10% of our product supply during fiscal 2019. Supply contracts typically have terms of 6 to 12 months. All of the supply contracts provide for minimum quantities and in most cases do not establish in advance the price of home heating oil or propane. This price is based upon a published market index price at the time of delivery or pricing date plus an agreed upon differential. We believe that our policy of contracting for the majority of our anticipated supply needs with diverse and reliable sources will enable us to obtain sufficient product should unforeseen shortages develop in worldwide supplies. 
 9

Liquid Product Price Volatility 
 Volatility, which is reflected in the wholesale price of liquid products, including home heating oil, propane and motor fuels, has a larger impact on our business when prices rise. Home heating oil consumers are price sensitive to heating cost increases, and this often leads to increased gross customer losses. As a commodity, the price of home heating oil is generally impacted by many factors, including economic and geopolitical forces. The price of home heating oil is closely linked to the price of diesel fuel. The volatility in the wholesale cost of diesel fuel as measured by the New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”), for the fiscal years ending September 30, 2015, through 2019, on a quarterly basis, is illustrated in the following chart (price per gallon): 

 | Fiscal 2019 (a) | | Fiscal 2018 | | | Fiscal 2017 | | Fiscal 2016 | Fiscal 2015 | 
--------------+-----------------+------+-------------+---+------+-------------+---+-------------+-------------+-----
Quarter Ended | Low | | High | | | Low | | High | Low | | High | | | Low | | High | Low | | High | 
December 31 | $ | 1.66 | | $ | 2.44 | | $ | 1.74 | $ | 2.08 | | $ | 1.39 | | $ | 1.70 | $ | 1.08 | | $ | 1.61 | $ | 1.85 | $ | 2.66

(a) | On November 30, 2019, the NYMEX ultra low sulfur diesel contract closed at $1.88 per gallon or $0.09 per gallon lower than the average of $1.97 in Fiscal 2019.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Acquisitions 
 Part of our business strategy is to pursue select acquisitions. 
 During fiscal 2019, the Company acquired one of its subcontractors, a liquid product dealer and the assets of a propane dealer with a combined total of approximately 24,000 home heating oil and propane accounts for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $60.9 million in cash. The gross purchase price was allocated $44.7 million to intangible assets, $13.7 million to fixed assets and $2.5 million to working capital. Each acquired company’s operating results are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements starting on its acquisition date. Customer lists, other intangibles and trade names are amortized on a straight-line basis over seven to twenty years.
 During fiscal 2018, the Company acquired five home heating oil dealers and a motor fuel dealer with a total of 16,950 home heating oil and propane accounts for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $25.2 million; comprised of $23.7 million in cash and $1.5 million of deferred liabilities. The gross purchase price was allocated $15.3 million to intangible assets, $7.5 million to fixed assets and $2.4 million to working capital. Each acquired company’s operating results are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements starting on its acquisition date. Customer lists, other intangibles and trade names are amortized on a straight-line basis over seven to twenty years.
 During fiscal 2017, the Company acquired four home heating oil dealers, two propane dealers and a plumbing service provider with a total of 28,300 home heating oil and propane accounts for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $44.8 million; comprised of $43.3 million in cash and $1.5 million of deferred liabilities (including $0.6 million of contingent consideration). The gross purchase price was allocated $37.5 million to intangible assets, $10.2 million to fixed assets and reduced by $2.9 million in working capital credits. Each acquired company’s operating results are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements starting on its acquisition date. Customer lists, other intangibles and trade names are amortized on a straight-line basis over seven to twenty years. 
 Employees 
 As of September 30, 2019, we had 3,446 employees, of whom 898 were office, clerical and customer service personnel; 978 were equipment technicians; 575 were fuel delivery drivers and mechanics; 633 were management and 362 were employed in sales. Of these employees 1,475 (43%) are represented by 59 different collective bargaining agreements with local chapters of labor unions. Due to the seasonal nature of our business and depending on the demands of the 2020 heating season, we anticipate that we will augment our current staffing levels during the heating season from among the 395 employees on temporary leave of absence as of September 30, 2019. There are 25 collective bargaining agreements up for renewal in fiscal 2020, covering approximately 791 employees (23%). We believe that our relations with both our union and non-union employees are generally satisfactory. 
 10

Government Regulations 
 We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Generally, these laws impose limitations on the discharge or emission of pollutants and establish standards for the handling of solid and hazardous wastes. These laws include the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), the Clean Air Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act, the Clean Water Act, the Oil Pollution Act, and comparable state statutes. CERCLA, also known as the “Superfund” law, imposes joint and several liabilities without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release or threatened release of a hazardous substance into the environment. Products stored and/or delivered by us and certain automotive waste products generated by our fleet are hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA or otherwise subject to investigation and cleanup under other environmental laws and regulations. While we are currently not involved with any material CERCLA claims, and we have implemented programs and policies designed to address potential liabilities and costs under applicable environmental laws and regulations, failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties or injunctive relief in cases of non-compliance or impose liability for remediation costs. 
 We have incurred and continue to incur costs to address soil and groundwater contamination at some of our locations, including legacy contamination at properties that we have acquired. A number of our properties are currently undergoing remediation, in some instances funded by prior owners or operators contractually obligated to do so. To date, no material issues have arisen with respect to such prior owners or operators addressing such remediation, although there is no assurance that this will continue to be the case. In addition, we have been subject to proceedings by regulatory authorities for alleged violations of environmental and safety laws and regulations. We do not expect any of these liabilities or proceedings of which we are aware to result in material costs to, or disruptions of, our business or operations. 
 Transportation of our products by truck are subject to regulations promulgated under the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act. These regulations cover the transportation of hazardous materials and are administered by the United States Department of Transportation or similar state agencies. Several of our oil terminals are governed under the United States Coast Guard operations Oversite, Federal OPA 90 FRP programs and Federal Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure programs. All of our propane bulk terminals are governed under Homeland Security Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards programs. We conduct ongoing training programs to help ensure that our operations are in compliance with applicable regulations. We maintain various permits that are necessary to operate some of our facilities, some of which may be material to our operations.
 There is increasing attention in the United States and worldwide concerning the issue of climate change and the effect of emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHG”), in particular from the combustion of fossil fuels. Federal, regional and state regulatory authorities in many jurisdictions have begun taking steps to regulate GHG emissions.
