 ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
 Unless the context suggests otherwise, the terms “Beacon,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us” are referring to Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc.
 Overview
 Beacon is the largest publicly traded distributor of roofing materials and complementary building products in the United States and Canada. We are among the oldest and most established distributors in the industry. The complementary building products we distribute include siding, windows, insulation, waterproofing systems, wallboard, acoustical ceilings, and other specialty exterior and interior building products. We purchase products from a large number of manufacturers and then distribute these goods to a customer base consisting of contractors, and to a lesser extent, home builders, retailers, and other building materials suppliers.
 As of September 30, 2019, we operated 529 branches throughout all 50 states in the U.S. and 6 provinces in Canada. We offer one of the most extensive assortments of high-quality branded products in the industry, with approximately 140,000 SKUs available across our branch network, enabling us to deliver products to serve over 110,000 customers on a timely basis.
 For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 (“fiscal year 2019” or “2019”), residential roofing products comprised 43.3% of our sales, non-residential roofing products accounted for 24.0% of our sales, and complementary products provided the remaining 32.7% of our sales. Approximately 97.4% of our net sales were to customers located in the United States.
 We provide our customers with a comprehensive array of value-added benefits, including access to an industry-leading digital platform that we continue to enhance and improve. The services and tools we provide are focused on supporting the entire business lifecycle and enhancing our customers’ ability to meet and exceed the needs of their clientele (see “Our Products and Services” for a full listing). We believe these value-added benefits distinguish us from our competition and promote high levels of customer retention. Our ability to save our customers time and money also enables us to achieve attractive gross profit margins on our product sales. We have earned a reputation for providing a high level of product availability and high-quality customer service thanks to our experienced employees who provide timely, accurate, and safe delivery of our products.
 Our customer base includes a diverse population of residential and non-residential building contractors from the markets in which we operate. These local, regional, and national contractors work on new construction projects as well as the repair or remodeling of residential and commercial properties, particularly in the areas of roofing/re-roofing. We utilize a branch-based operating model that allows branches to maintain local customer relationships and benefit from our centralized infrastructure. This operating model allows us to benefit from the resources and scale efficiencies of being a national distributor while still providing customers with specialized products and personalized local services tailored to their specific geographic region.
 Since our initial public offering (“IPO”) in 2004, we have achieved growth through completing strategic and complementary acquisitions, opening new branch locations, and broadening the scope of our product offerings. We have grown from net sales of $652.9 million in fiscal year 2004 to net sales of $7.1 billion in fiscal year 2019, representing a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 17.3%. Over the same period, income from operations has increased from $34.7 million to $147.8 million, representing a CAGR of 10.1%. Our organic growth, which includes growth from existing and newly opened branches (“greenfields”) but excludes growth from recently acquired branches, has averaged a CAGR of 4.7% per annum since 2004. The successful execution of our growth strategy is summarized by the following:
  
• | We have completed 46 strategic and complementary acquisitions since 2004, highlighted by the acquisitions of Allied Building Products Corp. (“Allied”) for $2.88 billion in 2018 (the “Allied Acquisition”) and Roofing Supply Group, LLC (“RSG”) for $1.17 billion in 2016 (the “RSG Acquisition”). These acquisitions expanded our geographic footprint, enhanced our scale and market presence, diversified our product offerings, and positioned us to provide new growth opportunities that will increase our long-term profitability.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We have opened 89 new branch locations since 2004, allowing us to establish a greater presence across the regions that we serve. In 2019 alone, we opened nine new branch locations across Alabama, California, Florida, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Texas.

Our Industry
 Market Size
 Based on management’s estimates, we believe the roofing distribution market in the United States and Canada represents approximately $26 billion in revenue with roughly 60% of the market in residential roofing and 40% in commercial. We also participate in other exterior and interior building products categories, including siding, wallboard, acoustical ceilings, waterproofing, windows and 
 4

insulation. Collectively, we believe these other building products have a larger addressable market opportunity than our primary roofing distribution business.
 Demand Drivers
 We believe the majority of roofing demand is driven by re-roofing activity (estimated at 80-90%), with the remaining balance being tied to new construction. Re-roofing projects are considered to be necessary maintenance and repair expenditures and are therefore less likely to be postponed during periods of recession or slower economic growth. As a result, demand for roofing products historically has been less volatile than overall demand for construction products.
 Our complementary building products demand shows exposure to both the residential and commercial sectors. These products possess greater exposure to new residential/commercial construction than within roofing, but they also have less seasonality, and lower exposure to weather conditions and severe storm volatility.
 Regional variations in economic activity influence the level of demand for roofing products across the United States. Of particular importance are regional differences in the level of new home construction and renovation. Demographic trends, including population growth and migration, contribute to the regional variations through their influence on regional housing starts and existing home sales.
 In addition to our domestic operations, we also operate in 6 provinces across Canada. These international locations represented approximately 2.6% of our total net sales for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019. We expect overall demand for operations in Canada to grow at rate similar to our United States operations. For further geographic information, see Notes 4 and 14 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Distribution Channels
 Wholesale distribution is the primary distribution channel for both residential and commercial roofing products. Wholesale roofing product distributors serve the important role of facilitating the purchasing relationships between roofing materials manufacturers and thousands of contractors. Wholesale distributors can maintain localized inventories, extend trade credit, give product advice and provide delivery and logistics services.
 Given significant consolidation in the past decade, Beacon and two other distributors now represent over 50% of the industry. The industry is characterized by these “national” distributors, a large number of local and regional roofing supply participants, as well as home improvement retailers and lumberyards. Our competition primarily involves the local, regional and national specialty roofing distributors.
 Our complementary products are distributed from traditional exteriors locations or branches designed to address a specific product and customer subset (e.g., interiors). The competitive landscape within interiors shares similar fragmentation characteristics to roofing, as four large participants, including Beacon, hold approximately a 50% combined position in the market. The other product categories are typically more fragmented and have more meaningful involvement from manufacturer direct sales, home improvement and specialty retailers and lumber yards.
 Our Strengths
 We believe the sales and earnings growth we have achieved over time has been, and will continue to be, driven by our primary competitive strengths, which include the following:

• | Leading distribution platform with a national scope. We maintain leading positions in key metropolitan markets across all regions that we serve, which currently includes all 50 states throughout the U.S. and 6 Canadian provinces. We utilize a branch-based operating model that benefits from the resources and scale efficiencies of a national distributor. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strategic geographic presence and regional specialization. Our geographic footprint is designed to provide advantages in the regional markets we serve. We provide our customers with specialized products and personalized local services tailored to their specific geographic region. This focus on customer service allows us to provide useful guidance to our customers throughout the project lifecycle. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Diversified and stable business model. Our business has been protected in times of economic downturn because of the non-discretionary nature of the demand for our products as well as the diversity of both our product offerings and our customer base. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, no single customer accounted for more than 1% of our net sales. We have a long history of organic sales growth and healthy gross margins through a variety of economic cycles. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Industry-leading digital platform. We provide industry-leading digital solutions, including Beacon PRO+, our innovative e-commerce portal, and Beacon 3D+, an in-home visualizer and dynamic modeling tool for our residential customers. These platforms help our customers save time, work more efficiently and grow their business. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Strong cash flow generation. We have increased net sales in thirteen of the fifteen fiscal years since our IPO, including increases in each of the last nine consecutively. Our track record of growth, combined with limited capital expenditure requirements, has resulted in strong cash flow generation that has allowed us to manage our debt leverage effectively. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Experienced management team with a successful track record of growth and integration. Our key employees, including executive officers, division presidents, and branch managers, are among the most experienced members of the roofing and building materials industry and have a track record of achieving growth and delivering profitability. Since our 2004 IPO, the Beacon management team has successfully completed and integrated 46 acquisitions and opened 89 new greenfield locations. We have a history of improving the financial and operating performance of our acquired businesses, allowing us to achieve incremental growth following integration onto our platform.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Well-designed technological infrastructure that continues to evolve. We have made a significant investment in our internal information systems and technological resources. Nearly our entire branch network operates on the same management information systems, providing us with a consistent platform to deliver excellent customer service and achieve operating efficiencies in purchasing, pricing and inventory management. Our unified platform has promoted the seamless integration of all our acquired businesses and allows us to pursue additional growth opportunities without concerns of significant additional investment. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Growth Strategy
 Our objective is to be the preferred supplier of roofing and other complementary building product materials across markets in the United States and Canada while continuing to increase net sales, maximize profitability and maintain a strong balance sheet. We plan to attain these goals by executing the following initiatives:

• | Selectively pursue opportunities for organic growth and strategic acquisitions. We believe that there will be meaningful opportunities to further expand or intensify our geographic focus in contiguous or existing regions. Our disciplined approach to opening new branches focuses on locations that are: (1) within existing markets; (2) where existing customers have expanded into new markets; or (3) in areas that have limited or no acquisition candidates and are a good fit with our business model and culture. We believe we can continue to expand and improve our distribution platform by strategically acquiring additional building product distributors in locations that are new or complement our existing operations in an area. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand product offerings and increase cross-selling activities. Due to the unique characteristics of each geographic region, our local customers typically require market-specific product offerings. We believe we have one of the most extensive offerings of high-quality branded products in the industry, with approximately 140,000 SKUs available across our branch network, and we feel that there are opportunities for our branches to expand their current product rosters. This will create additional opportunities for our branches to cross-sell more products throughout our existing network. In particular, we seek to expand non-residential roofing sales into markets where we currently sell mostly residential roofing. In addition, we work closely with customers and suppliers to identify new products and services, and continue to expand our product offering to include complementary building materials such as windows, siding, doors, waterproofing systems, insulation and metal fabrication. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue to provide exceptional customer service and expertise. We provide a comprehensive array of high-quality products and offer value-added services. In fiscal year 2019, we were able to support our customers by fulfilling approximately 99.1% of warehouse orders through our in-stock inventory as a result of the breadth and depth of the inventory maintained at our local branches. We believe that our focus on providing both value-added services and accurate and rapid order fulfillment enables us to attract and retain customers.

Our Customers
 We serve over 110,000 customers, comprised of contractors, home builders, building owners, and other resellers across the United States and Canada. Our customer base varies by size, ranging from relatively small contractors to large-sized contractors and builders that operate on a national scale. A significant number of our customers have relied on us as their vendor of choice for decades. We believe that we have strong customer relationships that our competitors cannot easily displace or replicate. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, no single customer accounted for more than 1% of our net sales.
Our Culture and Employees
 We believe that our values-based culture is a key differentiator, which is critical to our success. We pride ourselves on attracting and retaining highly dedicated and customer-focused employees at all levels of the organization. We maintain a safety-first environment and strong relations with our employees.
 As of September 30, 2019, we had 8,147 employees consisting of 2,371 in sales and marketing, 979 branch managers and assistant branch managers, 4,012 drivers, delivery helpers and warehouse workers, 715 general and administrative employees and 70 executives. We have 440 employees that are represented by labor unions and there are no material outstanding labor disputes.
 Sales and Marketing
 Sales Strategy
 Our sales strategy is to provide a comprehensive array of high-quality products and superior customer service, both accurately and on time. We believe that our proficiency in order fulfillment and inventory management and our robust catalog of value-added services, particularly the Beacon PRO+ e‑commerce platform, enable us to attract and retain customers and differentiate ourselves from the competition.
Sales Organization
 Our experienced sales force includes individuals responsible for generating sales at the local branch level as well individuals who focus on our larger, national account customers. We also retain sales personnel with specialized knowledge in relevant areas like solar and insulation. The breadth and expertise of our salespeople help us facilitate sales growth from both existing and prospective customers alike.
 Each of our branches is led by a branch manager, who also functions as the branch’s sales manager. There is also a sales director at each location that is responsible for overseeing and coaching the sales team. The typical branch sales team is composed of one to four outside salespeople and one to five inside salespeople. Branches that focus primarily on the residential market generally staff a larger number of outside salespeople.
 The primary objectives of our outside salespeople are to increase sales to existing customers and prospect for new customers. These activities are supported by utilizing our CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system throughout our selling organization. All outside sales representatives have a strategic group of existing customers that they actively manage to ensure that Beacon is meeting and exceeding their respective needs. They also spend time seeking new customers in order to grow and expand their portfolios.
 To complement our outside sales force, we have built an experienced and technically proficient inside sales staff with vital product expertise to address inquiries from our customers. Our inside sales force is on the front line of customer engagement and also is responsible for fielding incoming orders and providing price quotes.
 In addition to our outside and inside sales forces, we employ representatives who act as liaisons for certain roofing materials manufacturers to assist with the promotion of specific products to professional contractors, architects and building owners.
 Marketing
 Our marketing efforts are designed to ensure that our current and prospective customers understand the benefits they receive both from their local Beacon branches and from being part of a broader network of locations. As a supplement to the efforts of our sales force, each of our branches communicates with customers in its local market through email, newsletters, direct mail, social media, public relations and the key industry websites. In order to build and strengthen relationships with customers and vendors, we offer exclusive promotions and help sponsor key national and regional trade shows. We also develop general business and roofing seminars for our customers and organize product demonstrations by our vendors. We are an active member of the National Roofing Contractors Association, National Women in Roofing, and certain regional contractors’ associations.
 In fiscal year 2017, we introduced Beacon PRO+, our innovative e-commerce portal that enables customers to order online from our catalog of approximately 140,000 products and have 24/7 access to view real time pricing, process and review the status of 
 8

orders, track deliveries, monitor local storm activity and vendor promotions, request and approve quotes, and pay their bills online. The unique digital platform helps our customers save time, be more efficient, and enhance their business.
In fiscal year 2018, we introduced Beacon 3D+, a leading-edge service offering to our residential customers that transforms smartphone photos of any home to a fully measured, customizable 3D model. It is based on an exclusive relationship that enables us to be the only roofing supplier with this technology. Beacon 3D+ saves our customers time with measuring and pricing estimates and helps homeowners easily visualize what the finished project will look like.
 Purchasing and Suppliers
 Our status as a leader in our core geographic markets, as well as our reputation in the industry, has allowed us to forge strong relationships with numerous manufacturers of roofing materials and complementary building products, including Armstrong World Industries, Atlas Roofing, Berger Building Products, Building Products of Canada, Carlisle Syntec, CertainTeed Roofing, CertainTeed Siding, ClarkDietrich, Firestone Building Products, GAF, IKO Manufacturing, James Hardie Building Products, Johns Manville Roofing, Malarkey, National Gypsum, Owens Corning Roofing, Ply Gem, Soprema, and TAMKO Building Products.
 We are positioned as a key distributor with our suppliers due to our industry expertise, market share, track record of growth and financial strength, and the substantial volume of products that we distribute.
 We manage the procurement of products through our national headquarters and regional offices, allowing us to take advantage of both scale and local market conditions to purchase products more economically than most of our competitors. We place purchase orders electronically with some of our major vendors. When invoices are received, our system matches them to the related purchase orders and then schedules the associated payment. Product is shipped directly by the manufacturers to our branches or customers.
 Operations and Infrastructure
 Operations
 Our branch-based model provides each location with a significant amount of autonomy to operate within the parameters of our overall business model. Operations at each branch are tailored to meet local customer needs. Branch managers are responsible for sales, pricing and staffing activities, and have full operational control of customer service and deliveries. We provide our branch managers with significant incentives that allow them to share in the profitability of both their respective branches and the Company as a whole. Employees at our regional and corporate locations assist the branches with, among other things, procurement, credit and safety services, fleet management, information systems support, contract management, accounting, treasury and legal services, human resources, benefits administration and sales and use tax services.
 Our distribution fulfillment process is initiated upon receiving a request for a contract job order or direct product order from a customer. Under a contract job order, the customer typically requests roofing or other construction materials and technical support services. The customer discusses the project’s requirements with a salesperson and the salesperson provides a price quote for the package of products and services. Subsequently, the salesperson processes the order and we deliver the products to the customer’s job site. 
 Our digital platform serves as an extension of our brick and mortar operations and provides customers with 24/7 access to order and track delivery of our products. These advanced capabilities provide us with additional opportunities to engage with our customers and support the entire project lifecycle, enhancing their overall customer experience while contributing to the profitability of our Company.   
 In fiscal year 2019, we were able to support our customers by fulfilling approximately 99.1% of warehouse orders through our in-stock inventory as a result of the breadth and depth of the inventory maintained at our branches. 
 Facilities
 As of September 30, 2019, we operated a network of 529 branches that serve key metropolitan areas in all 50 states throughout the U.S. and 6 Canadian provinces. This network has enabled us to effectively and efficiently serve a broad customer base and to achieve a leading market position in each of our geographic markets.
Fleet
 During the year ended September 30, 2019, our distribution infrastructure supported more than 1.6 million deliveries. To service our customer base, we maintained a dedicated owned fleet of 1,860 straight trucks, 603 tractors and 1,238 trailers as of September 30, 2019. Nearly all of our delivery vehicles are equipped with specialized equipment, including 2,421 truck-mounted forklifts, cranes, hydraulic booms and conveyors, which are necessary to deliver products to rooftop job sites in an efficient and safe manner and in accordance with our customers’ requirements.
 9

Our branches typically focus on providing materials to customers who are located within a two-hour radius of their respective facilities. Our branches generally make deliveries each business day.
 Management Information Systems
 We have fully integrated management information systems across our locations. Acquired businesses are moved to our IT platform as soon as feasible following acquisition. Our systems support every major internal operational function, providing complete integration of purchasing, receiving, order processing, shipping, inventory management, sales analysis and accounting. The same databases are shared within the systems, allowing our branches to easily acquire products from other branches or schedule deliveries by other branches, greatly enhancing our customer service. Our systems also include a pricing matrix which allows us to refine pricing by region, branch, customer and customer type, or even a specific customer project. In addition, our systems allow us to centrally monitor all branch and regional performance as often as daily. We have centralized many functions to leverage our growing size, including accounts payable, insurance, payroll, employee benefits, vendor relations, and banking.
 We deploy an array of cybersecurity capabilities to protect our various business systems and data. Our branches are connected to a common computer network via secure Internet connections or private data lines. We maintain redundant systems with transactional data getting replicated throughout each business day. We have the capability of electronically switching our operations to the disaster recovery system. We retain many financial, credit and other documents for purposes of internal approvals, online viewing and auditing.
 Government Regulations
 We are subject to regulation by various federal, state, provincial and local agencies. These agencies include the Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Transportation, Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Department of Labor and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. We believe we comply, in all material respects, with existing applicable statutes and regulations affecting environmental issues and our employment, workplace health and workplace safety practices.
 In 2012, the United States Supreme Court upheld the majority of the provisions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “Act”). The Act places requirements on employers to provide a minimum level of benefits to employees and assesses penalties on employers if the benefits do not meet the required minimum level or if the cost of coverage to employees exceeds affordability thresholds specified in the Act. The minimum benefits and affordability requirements took effect in 2014. The Act also imposes an excise tax beginning in 2018 on plans whose average cost exceeds specified amounts. We have analyzed the effects on us from the provisions of the Act and we do not currently anticipate a significant financial impact.
 Competition
 Although we are one of the two largest roofing materials and complementary building product distributors in the United States and Canada, the industry remains highly competitive. The vast majority of our competition comes from local and regional roofing supply distributors, and, to a lesser extent, other building supply distributors and big box retailers. Among distributors, we compete against a small number of large distributors and many small and local privately-owned distributors. The principal competitive factors in our business include, but are not limited to, the availability of materials and supplies; technical product knowledge and expertise; advisory or other service capabilities; pricing of products; and the availability of credit and capital. We generally compete on the basis of the quality of our products and services, and to a lesser extent, price.
Order Backlog
 Order backlog is not a material aspect of our business and no material portion of our business is subject to government contracts.
 Seasonality
 In general, sales and net income are highest during our first, third and fourth fiscal quarters, which represent the peak months of construction and re-roofing, especially in our branches in the northern and midwestern regions of the United States and in Canada. Our sales are substantially lower during the second quarter, when we usually incur net losses.
 We generally experience our peak working capital needs during the third quarter after we build our inventories following the winter season but before we begin collecting on most of our spring receivables. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash and borrowings under our revolving credit facility, so our borrowings tend to be highest in the third quarter of our fiscal year.
