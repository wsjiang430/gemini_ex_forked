General
We are a diversified mortgage and real estate services business. We provide mortgage insurance and products and services to the real estate and mortgage finance industries through our two business segments—Mortgage Insurance and Services. Our Mortgage Insurance segment provides credit-related insurance coverage, principally through private mortgage insurance, as well as other credit risk management solutions to mortgage lending institutions and mortgage credit investors. We provide our mortgage insurance products and services mainly through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Radian Guaranty. Our Services segment is primarily a fee-for-service business that offers a broad array of mortgage, real estate and title services to market participants across the mortgage and real estate value chain. These services include technology and turn-key solutions, which provide information and other resources used to originate, evaluate, acquire, securitize, service and monitor residential real estate and loans secured by residential real estate. These services are primarily provided to mortgage lenders, financial institutions, investors and government entities. In addition, we provide title insurance to mortgage lenders as well as directly to borrowers. Our mortgage services include transaction management services such as loan review, RMBS securitization and distressed asset reviews, review and valuation services related to single family rental properties, servicer and loan surveillance and underwriting. Our real estate services include software as a service solutions and platforms, as well as managed services, such as REO asset management, real estate valuation services and real estate brokerage services. Our title services provide a comprehensive suite of title insurance products, title settlement services and both traditional and digital closing services. We provide our Services offerings primarily through our subsidiaries, including Clayton, Green River Capital, Radian Settlement Services and Red Bell. In 2018, we also acquired the businesses of EnTitle Direct (in March 2018) and Independent Settlement Services (in November 2018), as well as the assets of Five Bridges (in December 2018), to enhance our Services offerings.
Radian Group serves as the holding company for our insurance and other subsidiaries and does not have any operations of its own.

Business Strategy. Radian’s objectives include driving strong growth, increasing value creation and providing attractive stockholder returns. Consistent with these objectives, our business strategy, as highlighted below, is focused on growing our businesses and diversifying our revenue sources, while at the same time enhancing our operations and developing a one-company market view by integrating our product and services offerings more effectively. 

• | Write high-quality and profitable NIW to drive future earnings, in a manner that enhances the long-term economic value of our insured mortgage portfolio


• | Leverage our core competencies and increase our competitive differentiation in order to:


– | Grow our traditional mortgage insurance business in innovative ways


– | Expand our presence in the mortgage and real estate value chain beyond traditional mortgage insurance


– | Enhance our value to customers with increased diversification of services delivered by our integrated team


– | Maintain strong comprehensive enterprise risk management based on sound data and analytics


– | Enhance the quality, efficiency and performance of our operations and delivery of products and services


• | Manage our capital and financial flexibility to optimize stockholder value


• | Drive positive operating leverage by maintaining accretive revenue growth and effective expense management

We utilize various tools to assess the long-term economic value of our portfolio in order to identify opportunities to optimize stockholder value. For our Mortgage Insurance business, we evaluate the long-term economic value of our existing and future insured portfolio by using a measure that incorporates expected lifetime returns for our insurance policies, taking into consideration projected premiums, credit losses, investment income, operating expenses and taxes. These lifetime cash flows are then offset by the estimated cost of required capital, derived from our average cost of capital, to arrive at an estimated long-term economic value of our portfolio. We use this economic value to assist us in evaluating various portfolio strategies.
A key element of our business strategy is to use our Services segment to diversify our business and revenue streams by increasing our participation in multiple facets of the residential real estate and mortgage finance markets. In 2017, we undertook a strategic review of our Services business and made several decisions with respect to the business strategy that are designed to reposition this business to drive future growth and profitability. Following this strategic review, we committed to a restructuring plan and are focusing our efforts on offering mortgage, real estate and title services that we believe will satisfy demand in the market, diversify our revenue sources, strengthen our existing mortgage insurance customer relationships, attract new customers and differentiate us from our mortgage insurance peers. See “Services—Services Business Overview.”

Operating Environment
As a seller of mortgage credit protection and other credit risk management solutions, as well as a provider of mortgage, real estate and title services, the demand for our products and services is largely driven by the macroeconomic environment generally, and more specifically by the health of the housing, mortgage finance and related real estate markets.
Mortgage Insurance. Our mortgage insurance business is impacted by specific macroeconomic conditions and events that impact the mortgage origination environment and the credit performance of our portfolio of insured loans. The improvement in macroeconomic conditions since the financial crisis of 2007-2008, together with tighter credit requirements on new loans and an improvement in loan servicing, has contributed to the positive credit trends in our mortgage insurance portfolio, including a 
 13

lower level of new defaults and higher cure rates. Although this more restrictive credit environment has improved overall credit quality, it also has made it more challenging for many first-time home buyers to finance a home. In response, lenders and the GSEs recently have expanded their mortgage lending products, including to accommodate higher LTVs and debt-to-income ratios to address first-time home buyer demand and affordability considerations. 
Among other factors, private mortgage insurance industry volumes are impacted by total mortgage origination volumes and the mix between mortgage originations that are for purchased homes versus refinancings of existing mortgages. Generally, mortgage insurance penetration in the overall insurable mortgage market has been three to five times higher for purchase originations than for refinancings. As a result, despite an overall reduction in mortgage origination volume in 2018 compared to 2017 due to reduced refinancings, the private mortgage insurance market was larger in 2018 compared to 2017. Industry forecasts for 2019 project a mortgage origination market comparable to the market in 2018; however, purchase loan volume is expected to continue to increase, which is a favorable trend for private mortgage insurance. Given our expected mortgage insurance penetration rates, we expect the private mortgage insurance market in 2019 to be comparable to 2018. Based on industry forecasts and our projections, we currently expect our NIW for 2019 to be in the range of $50 billion. 
The environment for private mortgage insurers is highly competitive. We compete with other private mortgage insurers primarily on the basis of price, underwriting guidelines, overall service, customer relationships, perceived financial strength and reputation. In addition to other private mortgage insurers, we compete with governmental agencies, principally the FHA and the VA. See “Mortgage Insurance—Competition.”
Services. The macroeconomic conditions and other events that impact the housing, mortgage finance and related real estate markets also affect the demand for our mortgage, real estate and title services offered through our Services business segment. Sales volume in our Services business varies based on the overall activity in the housing and mortgage finance markets and the health of related industries. While non-GSE or “private label” securitization remains limited compared to the pre-financial crisis market, this market continued to expand in 2018 due to larger institutions re-entering the market, suggesting increased potential growth in 2019. Similarly, the single-family rental market continued to experience strong demand in 2018, driven in part by early refinance activity in the rising interest rate environment, as well as a GSE program that drove volume, but was later suspended at the end of 2018. While regulatory demands on mortgage market participants continue to be significant following the financial crisis, regulatory enforcement actions on mortgage industry participants have been less frequent, reducing the demand for our servicing quality control services as target customers form alternative strategies on how best to manage risk in the current and projected environment. Post-financial crisis, REO inventory levels also continue to decline due to lower delinquencies and foreclosure activity, reducing demand for our REO asset management services. Further, as the mortgage market continues to develop post-financial crisis, alternatives for managing costs have become more critical to the overall value proposition for market participants. As a result, we have observed increasing market trends towards use of non-appraisal valuation alternatives, which we expect will continue to grow. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Overview—Business Strategy.” We believe that the combination of our mortgage insurance business with our unique set of diversified mortgage, real estate and title services provides us with an opportunity to become increasingly more relevant to our customers and that this combination serves as a competitive differentiator for us compared to other private mortgage insurance companies.
Regulatory Environment
Our subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive regulations and other requirements. State insurance regulators impose various capital requirements on our mortgage insurance subsidiaries, including Risk-to-capital, other risk-based capital measures and surplus requirements. In addition, the GSEs, as the largest purchasers of conventional mortgage loans and therefore the primary beneficiaries of most of our mortgage insurance, impose eligibility requirements, or PMIERs, that private mortgage insurers must satisfy to be approved to insure loans purchased by the GSEs. The PMIERs aim to ensure that approved insurers will possess the financial and operational capacity to serve as strong counterparties to the GSEs throughout various market conditions. The PMIERs are comprehensive, covering virtually all aspects of the business and operations of a private mortgage insurer. The PMIERs financial requirements require that a mortgage insurer’s Available Assets meet or exceed its Minimum Required Assets. Radian Guaranty currently is an approved mortgage insurer under the PMIERs and is in compliance with the PMIERs financial requirements. See “Regulation.” 
Changes in the charters or business practices of the GSEs, including the GSEs’ interpretation and application of the PMIERs, can have a significant impact on our business. On September 27, 2018, the GSEs updated their eligibility requirements by issuing PMIERs 2.0, which will become effective on March 31, 2019. Radian expects to comply with PMIERs 2.0 and to maintain a significant excess of Available Assets over Minimum Required Assets (PMIERs “cushion”) as of the effective date. If applied as of December 31, 2018, the changes under PMIERs 2.0 would not have resulted in a material change in Radian Guaranty’s Minimum Required Assets, but would have reduced Radian Guaranty’s Available Assets and therefore 
 14

Glossary
Part I Item 1. Business
______________________________________________________________________________________________________

would have reduced Radian Guaranty’s PMIERs cushion. The reduction in Radian Guaranty’s Available Assets is primarily due to the elimination in PMIERS 2.0 of any credit for future premiums for insurance policies written prior to and including 2008, which is permitted under the current PMIERs. We expect the GSEs to continue to update the PMIERs periodically in the future, including potentially if and when the CCF is finalized. See “Regulation” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Radian Group—Short-Term Liquidity Needs—Capital Support for Subsidiaries.”
Mortgage Insurance
Mortgage Insurance Business Overview
Overview
Our Mortgage Insurance segment provides credit-related insurance coverage, principally through private mortgage insurance, as well as other credit risk management solutions, to mortgage lending institutions and mortgage credit investors. Private mortgage insurance plays an important role in the U.S. housing finance system because it promotes affordable home ownership and helps protect mortgage lenders, investors and other beneficiaries by mitigating default-related losses on residential mortgage loans. Generally, these loans are made to home buyers who make down payments of less than 20% of the purchase price for their home or, in the case of refinancings, have less than 20% equity in their home. Private mortgage insurance also facilitates the sale of these loans in the secondary mortgage market, most of which are currently sold to the GSEs.
See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Results—Mortgage Insurance.”
Mortgage Insurance Products
Primary Mortgage Insurance. Primary mortgage insurance provides protection against mortgage defaults at a specified coverage percentage. When there is a valid claim under primary mortgage insurance, the maximum liability is determined by multiplying the claim amount, which consists of the unpaid loan principal, plus past due interest and certain expenses associated with the default, by the coverage percentage. Claims may be settled for the maximum liability or for other amounts. See “—Claims Management” below.
We mainly provide primary mortgage insurance on an individual loan basis as each mortgage is originated, but we also can provide primary mortgage insurance on individual loans in an aggregate group of mortgages after they have been originated. We primarily write insurance in a “first loss” position, where we are responsible for the first losses incurred on an insured loan subject to a policy limit. See “—Mortgage Insurance Portfolio—Mortgage Loan Characteristics.” 
The terms of our primary mortgage insurance coverage are set forth in a master insurance policy that we enter into with each of our customers. Our Master Policies are filed in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Among other things, our Master Policies set forth the terms and conditions of our mortgage insurance coverage, including: loan eligibility requirements; premium payment requirements; coverage term; provisions for policy administration, servicing standards and requirements; exclusions or reductions in coverage; claims payment and settlement procedures; and dispute resolution procedures. Although the mortgage insurance we write protects the lenders from a portion of losses resulting from loan defaults, it does not provide protection against property loss or physical damage. Among other exclusions, our Master Policies contain an exclusion against physical damage, including damage caused by hurricanes or other natural disasters. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview—Operating Environment—Hurricanes.”
We wrote $56.5 billion and $53.9 billion of first-lien primary mortgage insurance in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Substantially all of our primary mortgage insurance written during 2018 and 2017 was written on a Flow Basis. The combination of our NIW and a higher Persistency Rate resulted in an increase in IIF, from $200.7 billion at December 31, 2017 to $221.4 billion at December 31, 2018. Our total direct primary mortgage insurance RIF was $56.7 billion at December 31, 2018, compared to $51.3 billion at December 31, 2017.
Other Mortgage Insurance Products. We also have other mortgage insurance products that had RIF of $0.5 billion at December 31, 2018, as described below:

• | GSE Credit Risk Transfer. Part of our business strategy includes leveraging our core expertise in credit risk management and expanding our presence in the mortgage finance industry. We are currently participating in Front-end and Back-end credit risk transfer programs developed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as part of their

 15

Part I Item 1. Business

initiative to distribute mortgage credit risk and increase the role of private capital in the mortgage market. As of December 31, 2018, the total RIF under the Front-end and Back-end credit risk transfer transactions was $196.8 million. We will only experience claims under these Front-end and Back-end credit risk transfer transactions if the borrower’s equity, any existing primary mortgage insurance (if applicable) and the GSEs’ retained risk are depleted. In participating in these GSE transactions, we assume incremental risk (beyond that which we typically cover in our traditional mortgage insurance business) associated with the risk of defaults caused by physical damage, including natural disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires, which is not covered by the underlying primary mortgage insurance. We regularly evaluate this risk, including the geographic diversity of the loans included in these transactions and our remote risk position, in assessing our participation in these transactions. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview—Business Strategy.” 

• | Pool Insurance. Prior to 2008, we wrote Pool Insurance on a limited basis. At December 31, 2018, Pool Insurance made up only $324.6 million of our total direct first-lien insurance RIF, as compared to $339.0 million at December 31, 2017. With respect to our Pool Insurance, an aggregate exposure limit, or “stop loss” (usually between 1% and 10%), is generally applied to the initial aggregate loan balance on a group or “pool” of mortgages. In addition, an insured pool of mortgages may contain mortgages that are already covered by primary mortgage insurance. In these transactions, Pool Insurance is secondary to any primary mortgage insurance that exists on mortgages within the pool. Our Pool Insurance policies are privately negotiated and are separate from the Master Policies that we use for our primary mortgage insurance.


• | Non-Traditional Risk. In the past, we provided other forms of credit enhancement on residential mortgage assets. Our non-traditional products included mortgage insurance on second-lien mortgage loans and we also provided mortgage insurance on an international basis. As of December 31, 2018, we have terminated all of our international mortgage insurance. Our total amount of non-traditional risk was $15.2 million at December 31, 2018, which consisted entirely of second-lien RIF, as compared to $24.4 million at December 31, 2017.

Premium Rates
Primary Mortgage Insurance. A premium rate is determined when insurance coverage is requested on a mortgage, which is generally near the time of loan origination. Premiums for our mortgage insurance products are established based on performance models that consider a broad range of borrower, loan and property characteristics as well as current and projected market and economic conditions. Our premium rates are generally subject to regulation, and in most states where our insurance subsidiaries are licensed, our premiums must be filed, and in some cases approved, before their use. See “Regulation—State Regulation—State Insurance Regulation.”
We establish our premium levels to be competitive within the mortgage insurance industry and to achieve an overall risk-adjusted rate of return on capital given our modeled performance expectations. Our actual returns may differ from our expectations based on changing market conditions and other factors. Among other factors, we set our premium rates based on assumptions about policy performance, including, without limitation, our expectations and assumptions about: (i) the likelihood of default; (ii) how long the policy will remain in place; (iii) the costs of acquiring and maintaining the insurance; (iv) taxes; and (v) the capital that is required to support the insurance. Our performance assumptions for claim frequency and policy life are developed based on data regarding our own historical experience, as well as data generated from independent, third-party sources.
Premiums on our mortgage insurance products are generally paid either on a monthly installment basis (“Monthly Premiums”) or in a single payment (“Single Premiums”) generally paid at the time of loan origination. There are also alternative products (“Other Premiums”) where premiums may be paid on an annual installment basis or as a combination of up-front premium at origination plus a monthly installment. In addition, Other Premiums may be paid after loan origination or may include a refundable component. Some programs, subject to certain conditions, provide coverage for the life of the loan while others terminate when certain criteria are met. There are many factors that influence the types of premiums we receive, including: (i) the percentage of mortgage originations derived from refinancing transactions versus new home purchases; (ii) the customers with whom we do business (e.g., mix of Single Premium Policies and policies with Monthly and Other Premiums varies by customer); and (iii) the relative premium levels we and our competitors set for the various forms of premiums offered. 
Mortgage insurance premiums can be funded through a number of methods, and while the coverage remains for the benefit of the insured or third-party beneficiary, the premiums may be paid by the borrower or by the lender. Borrower-paid mortgage insurance premiums are generally paid either through separate escrowed amounts or financed as a component of the mortgage loan amount. Lender-paid mortgage insurance premiums are paid by the lender and are typically passed through to 
 16

Glossary
Part I Item 1. Business
______________________________________________________________________________________________________

the borrower in the form of additional origination fees or a higher interest rate on the mortgage note. Our Monthly and Other Premiums are generally established as either: (i) a fixed percentage of the loan’s amortizing balance over the life of the policy or (ii) as a fixed percentage of the initial loan balance for a set period of time (typically 10 years), after which the premium declines to a lower fixed percentage for the remaining life of the policy.
The impact of market conditions on our returns will vary based on, among other factors, whether the insurance is borrower-paid or lender-paid, and whether the payments are made monthly or in a single premium payment at the time of origination. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Results—Mortgage Insurance—Premiums.” A change in capital requirements on insured loans can also affect our returns. See “Regulation—GSE Requirements—PMIERs—Private Mortgage Insurer Eligibility Requirements.”
As the mortgage insurance industry migrates away from a predominantly rate-card-based pricing model, various pricing methodologies are being deployed with differing degrees of risk-based granularity, which may also lead to an increased frequency of pricing changes. We currently use proprietary risk and customer analytics, as well as a digital pricing delivery platform, to deliver loan level pricing electronically to our customers, including Radian’s RADAR Rates as further discussed below. Our pricing options vary in the level of granularity and we deliver them to our customers based on their business needs and loan origination process. In January 2019, we broadly introduced RADAR Rates as our newest pricing option that is powered by Radian’s proprietary RADAR risk model and analyzes credit risk inputs to customize a rate quote to a borrower’s individual risk profile, loan attributes and property characteristics. Our strategy is to consistently apply an approach to pricing that is customer-centric, flexible and customizable based on a lender’s loan origination process, as well as balanced with our own objectives for managing the risk and return profile of our insured portfolio.
GSE Credit Risk Transfer Transactions. Credit risk transfer premium rates are established through a sealed-bid auction process in which potential insurers/reinsurers provide their desired allocation of the offering(s) at a specified premium rate. Radian evaluates each transaction and determines its bid based on performance models that consider a broad range of borrower, loan and property characteristics as well as market and forecasted future economic conditions. The GSEs set a uniform premium based on an assessment of the bids received and, based on their desired counterparty exposure, assign allocations to insurers/reinsurers.
Underwriting
Mortgage loan applications are underwritten to determine whether they are eligible for our mortgage insurance. We perform this function directly or, alternatively, we delegate to our insured lenders the ability to underwrite the mortgage loans based on compliance with our underwriting guidelines.
Delegated Underwriting. Through our delegated underwriting program we approve insured lenders to underwrite mortgage loan applications based on our mortgage insurance underwriting guidelines. Each lender participating in the delegated underwriting program must be approved by our risk management group. Utilization of our delegated underwriting program enables us to meet lenders’ demands for immediate insurance coverage and increases the efficiency of the underwriting process. We use quality control sampling and performance monitoring to manage the risks associated with delegated underwriting. Under the terms of the program, we have certain rights to rescind coverage if there has been a deviation from our underwriting guidelines. For a discussion of these limited Rescission rights, see “—Claims Management—Rescissions.” As of December 31, 2018, 63% of our total first-lien IIF had been originated on a delegated basis, compared to 66% as of December 31, 2017. 
Non-Delegated Underwriting. In addition to our delegated underwriting program, insured lenders may also submit mortgage loan applications to us and we will perform the mortgage insurance underwriting. In general, we are less likely to exercise our Rescission rights with respect to underwriting errors related to loans that we underwrite for mortgage insurance. As a result, following a period of high Rescissions after the financial crisis, many lenders have chosen to have us perform the mortgage insurance underwriting on a non-delegated basis. Given the professional resources we need to maintain to underwrite mortgage loans, an increase in non-delegated underwriting demand generally increases our operating costs to support this program. 
Contract Underwriting. We also provide third party contract underwriting services to our mortgage insurance customers through our Services segment. See “Services—Services Business Overview—Services Offered—Mortgage Services.” During 2018, mortgage loans underwritten through contract underwriting accounted for 3.8% of insurance certificates issued on a Flow Basis, as compared to 5.4% in 2017.

Mortgage Insurance Portfolio
Direct Risk in Force
Exposure in our mortgage insurance business is measured by RIF, which for primary insurance is equal to the underlying loan unpaid principal balance multiplied by our insurance coverage percentage.
Our total direct primary mortgage insurance RIF was $56.7 billion at December 31, 2018. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations—Mortgage Insurance—NIW, IIF, RIF” for additional information about the composition of our primary RIF. See “—Mortgage Insurance Business Overview—Mortgage Insurance Products” for additional information regarding other mortgage insurance RIF.
We analyze our mortgage insurance portfolio in a number of ways to identify any concentrations or imbalances in risk dispersion. We believe that, among other factors, the credit performance of our mortgage insurance portfolio is affected significantly by: 

• | general economic conditions (in particular, interest rates, home prices and unemployment);


• | the age and performance history of the loans insured;


• | the geographic dispersion and other characteristics of the properties securing the insured loans and the condition of local housing markets;


• | the quality of underwriting at loan origination; and


• | the credit characteristics of the borrower and the characteristics of the loans insured.

Direct Primary RIF by Year of Policy Origination and Persistency

The amount of time that our insurance certificates remain in force, which is affected by loan repayments and terminations of our insurance, has a significant impact on our revenues and our results of operations. Our Persistency Rate is one key measure for assessing the impact that insurance terminations resulting in certificate cancellations have on our IIF. Because our insurance premiums are earned over time, higher Persistency Rates on Monthly Premium Policies increase the premiums we receive and generally result in increased profitability and returns. Conversely, assuming all other factors remain constant, higher Persistency Rates on Single Premium business lower the overall returns from our insured portfolio, as the premium revenue for our Single Premium Policies is the same regardless of the actual life of the insurance policy and we are required to maintain regulatory capital and Available Assets supporting the insurance for the life of the policy. The Persistency Rate of our primary mortgage insurance was 83.1% at December 31, 2018, compared to 81.1% at December 31, 2017. Historically, there is a close correlation between interest rates and Persistency Rates. Lower interest rate environments generally increase refinancings that result in the cancellation of our insurance. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations—Mortgage Insurance—NIW, IIF, RIF” for the details regarding our Persistency Rates.
A higher Persistency Rate results in our IIF remaining in place for a longer period of time. Our IIF is one of the primary drivers of future premiums that we expect to earn over time. We expect our IIF to generate substantial income in future periods, due to the high credit quality of our current mortgage insurance portfolio and our expected Persistency Rate over multiple years. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Results—Mortgage Insurance—IIF; Persistency Rate; Mix of Business” for more information.

Mortgage Loan Characteristics
In addition to geographic dispersion, other factors also contribute significantly to our overall risk diversification and the credit quality of our RIF, including product distribution, underwriting and our risk management practices. We consider a number of borrower, loan and property characteristics in evaluating the credit quality of our portfolio and developing our pricing and risk management strategies.
LTV. An important indicator of claim incidence in our mortgage insurance business is the relative amount of a borrower’s equity that exists in a home. Generally, absent other mitigating factors such as high FICO scores and other credit factors, loans with higher LTVs at inception (i.e., smaller down payments) are more likely to result in a claim than lower LTV loans. The average original LTV of our primary NIW in 2018 was 92.5%, compared to 92.2% and 91.4% in 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
Loan Grade/FICO Score. The risk of claim on non-prime loans is significantly higher than that on prime loans. We use our proprietary models to classify a loan as either prime or non-prime on the basis of a borrower’s FICO score, the level of loan file documentation and other factors. In general we consider a loan to be a prime loan if the borrower’s FICO score is 620 or higher and the loan file meets “fully documented” standards of our credit guidelines and/or the GSE guidelines for fully documented loans. Substantially all of our NIW after 2008 has been on prime loans.
Loans that we categorize as Alt-A and A minus and below are considered non-prime loans due to lower FICO scores, reduced loan file documentation, and/or the presence of other risk characteristics. 
Loan Size. Relatively higher-priced properties with larger mortgage loan amounts generally have experienced wider fluctuations in value than more moderately priced residences and have been more likely to result in a claim. The average loan size of our direct primary mortgage IIF as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $216.5 thousand, $210.0 thousand and $203.2 thousand, respectively.

______________________________________________________________________________________________________

Loan Purpose, Property Type and Occupancy. We consider other factors, including property type, occupancy type and loan purpose in assessing our risk of loss. In general, it has been our experience that our risk of claim is lower on loans secured by single family detached housing than loans on other types of properties, and is higher on non-owner occupied homes purchased for investment purposes than on either primary or second homes. Loan purpose may also impact our risk of loss. For example, cash-out refinance loans, where a borrower receives cash in connection with refinancing a loan, have been more likely to result in a claim than new purchase loans or loans that are refinanced only to adjust rate and term. 
See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations—Mortgage Insurance—NIW, IIF, RIF” for additional information about the credit quality and characteristics of our direct primary mortgage insurance.
Defaults and Claims
Defaults. In our Mortgage Insurance segment, the default and claim cycle begins with the receipt of a default notice from the loan servicer. We consider a loan to be in default for financial statement and internal tracking purposes upon receipt of notification by servicers that a borrower has missed two monthly payments. Defaults also can occur due to a variety of specific events affecting borrowers, including death or illness, divorce or other family problems, unemployment, factors impacting regional economic conditions (e.g., hurricanes, floods, wildfires or other natural disasters), or other events. 
The default rate in our mortgage insurance business can be subject to seasonality. Historically, our mortgage insurance business experiences a fourth quarter seasonal increase in the number of defaults and a first quarter seasonal decline in the number of defaults and increase in the number of Cures. While historically this has been the case, macroeconomic factors in any given period may influence the default rate in our mortgage insurance business more than seasonality. 
The loans from our origination years after 2008 possess significantly improved credit characteristics compared to our portfolio originated in the years prior to and including 2008, including higher average FICO scores for the borrowers of these insured mortgages. In addition, refinancings under the HARP programs have positively impacted the overall credit quality and composition of our mortgage insurance portfolio because the refinancing generally results in terms under which a borrower has a greater ability to pay and more financial flexibility to cover the loan obligations. Our portfolio of business written after 2008 is now the predominant portion of our total primary RIF. The sum of our policies written after 2008 through 2018 and our HARP refinancings accounted for approximately 94% of our total primary RIF at December 31, 2018, compared to 92% at December 31, 2017.
The following table shows the states that have generated the highest number of primary insurance defaults (measured as of December 31, 2018) in our insured portfolio and the corresponding percentage of total defaults as of the dates indicated:

______________________

Claims. Defaulted loans that fail to become current, or “cure,” may result in a claim under our mortgage insurance policies. Mortgage insurance claim volume is influenced by the circumstances surrounding the default. The rate at which defaults cure, or do not go to claim, depends in large part on a borrower’s financial resources and circumstances (including whether the borrower is eligible for a loan modification), local housing prices and housing supply (i.e., whether borrowers are able to cure defaults by selling the property in full satisfaction of all amounts due under the mortgage), interest rates and regional economic conditions. In our first-lien primary insurance business, the insured must acquire title to the property (typically through a foreclosure proceeding) before submitting a claim. The time for a lender to acquire title to a property through foreclosure varies depending on the state, and in particular whether a state requires a lender to proceed through the judicial system in order to complete the foreclosure. Following the financial crisis, the time between a default and a request for 
 21

Glossary
Part I Item 1. Business
______________________________________________________________________________________________________

claim payment increased, largely as a result of foreclosure delays due to, among other factors, increased scrutiny within the mortgage servicing industry and foreclosure process. These delays have been improving as the economy recovers from the financial crisis. For Pool Insurance, which represents less than 1% of our RIF at December 31, 2018, our policies typically require the insured to not only acquire title but also to actively market and ultimately liquidate the real estate asset before filing a claim, which generally lengthens the time between a default and a claim submission.
Claim activity is not spread evenly throughout the coverage period of a book of business. Historically, for prime business relatively few claims are received during the first two years following issuance of a policy.
See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations—Mortgage Insurance—NIW, IIF, RIF—Provision for Losses” for various claims paid tables, including Direct Claims Paid by Origination Year.
The following table shows the states with the highest direct claims paid (measured as of December 31, 2018) for the periods indicated:

 | Year Ended December 31,
(In millions) | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
States with highest direct claims paid (first-lien): | | | | | 
New Jersey | $ | 37.2 | | | $ | 54.7 | | $ | 46.1
Florida | 22.5 | | | 45.7 | | | 59.4
New York | 20.4 | | | 34.2 | | | 26.6
Illinois | 13.8 | | | 23.4 | | | 32.3
California | 8.9 | | | 16.3 | | | 23.1

In addition to claim volume, Claim Severity is another significant factor affecting losses. We calculate the Claim Severity by dividing the claim paid amount by the original coverage amount. Factors that impact the severity of a claim include, but are not limited to, the size of the loan, the amount of mortgage insurance coverage placed on the loan, the amount of time between default and claim during which we are expected to cover certain interest (capped at two years under our Prior Master Policy and capped at three years under our 2014 Master Policy) and expenses, and the impact of our Loss Mitigation and other loss management activities with respect to the loan. Pre-foreclosure sales, acquisitions and other early workout efforts help to reduce overall Claim Severity, as do actions we may take to reduce a claim payment due to servicer negligence, as discussed below in “Claims Management.” See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations—Mortgage Insurance—NIW, IIF, RIF—Provision for Losses.”
Claims Management
Our claims management process is focused on promptly analyzing and processing claims to ensure that valid claims are paid in a timely and accurate manner. In addition, our mortgage insurance claims management department pursues opportunities to mitigate losses both before and after claims are received. 
Claims. In our traditional mortgage insurance business, upon receipt of a valid claim, we generally have the following three settlement options:

(1) | Percentage Option: Pay the maximum liability and allow the insured lender to keep title to the property. The maximum liability is determined by multiplying (x) the claim amount (which consists of the unpaid loan principal, plus past due interest for a period of time specified in our Master Policies and certain expenses associated with the default) by (y) the applicable coverage percentage;


(2) | Approved Sale Option: Pay the amount of the claim required to make the lender whole (not to exceed our maximum liability), following an approved sale; or


(3) | Acquisition Option: Pay the full claim amount and acquire title to the property.

Approved sales in which the underlying property has been sold for less than the outstanding loan amount are commonly referred to as “short sales.” Although short sales may have the effect of reducing our ultimate claim obligation, in many cases, a short sale will result in the payment of a claim in an amount that is equal to the maximum liability amount. Under our Master Policies, we retain the right to consent prior to the consummation of any short sales. We have entered into agreements with each of the GSEs, pursuant to which we delegated to the GSEs our prior consent rights with respect to short sales on loans owned by 
 22

Glossary
Part I Item 1. Business
______________________________________________________________________________________________________

the GSEs, as long as the short sales meet the GSE guidelines and processes for short sales and subject to certain other factors set forth in these agreements. We also provide for limited delegation authority to certain loan servicers for short sales under specific circumstances. For loans that are not owned by the GSEs and for which we have not granted specific delegation authority to the loan servicer, we perform an individual analysis of each proposed short sale and provide our consent to these sales when appropriate. Historically, we have consented to a short sale only after reviewing various factors, including among other items, the sale price relative to market and the ability of the borrower to contribute to any shortfall in the sale proceeds as compared to the outstanding loan amount.
After a claim is received, our loss management specialists may focus on:

• | a review to determine compliance with applicable loan origination programs and our mortgage insurance policy requirements, including: (i) whether the loan qualified for insurance at the time the certificate of coverage was issued, (ii) whether the insured has satisfied its obligation in meeting all necessary conditions in order for us to pay a claim, including submitting all necessary documentation in connection with the claim (commonly referred to as “claim perfection”) and (iii) whether the loan was appropriately serviced in accordance with the standards set forth in our Master Policies;


• | analysis and prompt processing to ensure that valid claims are paid in an accurate and timely manner;


• | responses to loss mitigation opportunities presented by the insured; and


• | management and disposal of acquired real estate.

Radian Guaranty has entered into a Factored Claim Administration Agreement with Fannie Mae that applies to certain loans owned by Fannie Mae that were insured under the 2014 Master Policy for which a claim is submitted on or after October 1, 2018. Pursuant to the agreement, Radian Guaranty will determine the amount of covered expenses forming part of a loss (other than unpaid principal balance and delinquent interest) using pre-negotiated expense factors based on certain characteristics of the applicable loan and property. 
Claim Denials. We have the legal right under our Master Policies to deny a claim under certain conditions, such as when the loan servicer does not produce documents necessary to perfect a claim, including evidence that the insured has acquired title to the property, within the time period specified in our Master Policies. Most often, a Claim Denial is the result of a servicer’s failure to provide the loan origination file or other critical servicing documents for review. If, after requests by us, the loan origination file or other servicing documents are not provided to us, we generally deny the claim. If we deny a claim, we continue to allow the insured the ability to perfect the claim for a period of time specified in our Master Policies. If the insured successfully perfects the claim on a timely basis, we will process the claim, including a review of the loan to ensure appropriate underwriting and loan servicing. If, after completion of this process, we determine that the claim was not perfected, the insurance claim is denied and we consider the Claim Denial to be final and resolved. Although we may make a final determination internally with respect to a Claim Denial, it is possible that after we have a denied coverage a legal challenge to our decision to deny coverage may be brought within a period of time specified under the terms of our Master Policies.
Rescissions. Under the terms of our Master Policies we have the legal right, under certain conditions, to unilaterally rescind coverage on our mortgage insurance policies. If we rescind coverage based on a determination that a loan did not qualify for insurance, we provide the insured with a period of time to challenge, or rebut, our decision.
Typical events that may give rise to our right to rescind coverage include: (i) we insure a loan under one of our Master Policies in reliance upon an application for insurance that contains a material misstatement, misrepresentation or omission, whether intentional or otherwise, or that was issued as a result of an act of fraud or (ii) we find that there was negligence in the origination of a loan that we insured. We also have rights of Rescission arising from a breach of the insured’s representations and warranties contained in an endorsement to our Master Policies that is required with our delegated underwriting program.
If a rebuttal to our Rescission is received and the insured provides additional information supporting the continuation (i.e., non-rescission) of coverage, we have the claim re-examined internally by a separate, independent investigator. If the additional information supports the continuation of coverage, the insurance is reinstated and the claim is paid. After completion of this process, if we determine that the loan did not qualify for coverage, the insurance certificate is rescinded (and the total premiums paid are refunded) and we consider the Rescission to be final and resolved. Although we may make a final determination internally with respect to a Rescission, it is possible that a legal challenge to our decision to rescind coverage may be brought after we have rescinded coverage during a period of time that is specified under the terms of our Master Policies.
In 2012, we began offering a limited rescission waiver program under our Prior Master Policy for our delegated underwriting customers, in which we agree not to rescind coverage due to non-compliance with our underwriting guidelines so 
 23

Glossary
Part I Item 1. Business
______________________________________________________________________________________________________

long as the borrower makes 36 consecutive payments (commencing with the initial required payment) from his or her own funds. This program does not restrict our rights to rescind coverage in the event of fraud or misrepresentation in the origination of the loans we insure. 
Following the financial crisis, the FHFA and the GSEs identified specific requirements to be included by all private mortgage insurers in their master policies for new mortgage insurance applications received on or after October 1, 2014. Among others, these included specific requirements related to loss mitigation and claims processing activities that limited the potential for Loss Mitigation Activity throughout the private mortgage insurance industry. Radian Guaranty incorporated these principles into its 2014 Master Policy. Radian Guaranty also offers 12-month and 36-month rescission relief programs in accordance with the specified terms and conditions set forth in the 2014 Master Policy. Loans that were already insured prior to the October 1, 2014 effective date of the 2014 Master Policy continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of Radian Guaranty’s Prior Master Policy. 
The FHFA and the GSEs have proposed revised GSE Rescission Relief Principles to, among other things, further limit the circumstances under which mortgage insurers may rescind coverage. We are in the process of incorporating these principles into a new master policy, which we expect will be effective during the second half of 2019. We currently are in discussions with the GSEs regarding the form of this new master policy, including as it relates to these proposed principles, which if adopted, are likely to further reduce our ability to rescind insurance coverage in the future, potentially resulting in higher losses than would be the case under our existing Master Policies.
Claim Curtailments. We also have rights under our Master Policies to curtail, and in some circumstances, deny claims due to servicer negligence. Examples of servicer negligence may include, without limitation:

• | a failure to report information to us on a timely basis as required under our Master Policies;


• | a failure to pursue loss mitigation opportunities presented by borrowers, realtors and/or any other interested parties;


• | a failure to pursue loan modifications and/or refinancings through programs available to borrowers or an undue delay in presenting claims to us (including as a result of improper handling of foreclosure proceedings), which increases the interest or other components of a claim we are required to pay; and


• | a failure to initiate and diligently pursue foreclosure or other appropriate proceedings within the timeframe specified in our Master Policies.

Although we could seek post-claim recoveries from the beneficiaries of our policies if we later determine that a claim was not valid, because our loss mitigation process is designed to ensure compliance with our policies prior to payment of a claim, historically we have not sought recoveries from the beneficiaries of our mortgage insurance policies once a claim payment has been made.

Customers
The principal customers of our mortgage insurance business are mortgage originators such as mortgage bankers, commercial banks, savings institutions, credit unions and community banks. Sources of primary NIW by type of mortgage originator for the year ended December 31, 2018 are shown in the chart below.
Our largest single mortgage insurance customer (including branches and affiliates) measured by primary NIW, accounted for 4.7% of NIW during 2018, compared to 6.8% and 5.7% in 2017 and 2016, respectively. No customer had earned premiums that accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues in 2018, 2017 or 2016.
Since 2009, we have taken steps to diversify our customer base. As a result of these efforts, the percentage of NIW generated by our top 10 customers has decreased from 62.3% in 2009 to 29.1% in 2018. Since 2010, we have added over 1,000 net new customers and significantly increased the amount of business derived from mid-sized mortgage banks. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our NIW and franchise value could decline if we lose business from significant customers.”
Competition
We operate in the highly competitive U.S. mortgage insurance industry. Our competitors primarily include other private mortgage insurers and federal and state governmental agencies, principally the FHA and VA.
In addition to Radian Guaranty, the private mortgage insurers that are currently approved and eligible to write business for the GSEs are: 

• | Arch U.S. MI;


• | Essent Guaranty Inc.;


• | Genworth Financial Inc.;


• | Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corporation;


• | NMI Holdings, Inc.; and


• | United Guaranty Corp. (acquired by Arch Capital Group LLC in December 2016).

We compete directly with other private mortgage insurers primarily on the basis of price, underwriting guidelines, overall service, customer relationships, perceived financial strength (including comparative credit ratings) and reputation. Overall 
 25

Glossary
Part I Item 1. Business
______________________________________________________________________________________________________

service competition is based on, among other things, effective and timely delivery of products, timeliness of claims payments, customer service, timely and accurate servicing of policies, training, loss mitigation efforts and management and field service expertise. We also believe that service includes our ability to offer services to customers through our Services business that complement our mortgage insurance products. 
Pricing has always been and continues to be competitive in the mortgage insurance industry, as industry participants compete for market share and customer relationships. We monitor various competitive and economic factors while seeking to increase the long-term value of our portfolio by balancing both profitability and volume considerations in developing our pricing and origination strategies. We have taken a disciplined approach to establishing our premium rates and writing a mix of business that we expect to produce our targeted level of returns on a blended basis and an acceptable level of NIW. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview—Competition and Pricing—Radian's Pricing.” As demonstrated by our strong NIW generated in 2018, we believe we remain well positioned to compete for the high-quality business being originated today, while at the same time maintaining projected returns on NIW within our targeted ranges. Based on publicly available information, we estimate that our share of NIW within the private mortgage insurance market (excluding HARP refinancings) was approximately 19% for 2018.
Certain of our private mortgage insurance competitors are subsidiaries of larger corporations, may have access to greater amounts of capital and financial resources than we do at a lower cost of capital (including off-shore reinsurance vehicles) and currently have better financial strength ratings than we have. As a result, they may be better positioned to compete outside of traditional mortgage insurance, including in the private label securitization market or if the GSEs expand their use of, or pursue alternative forms of, credit enhancement outside of private mortgage insurance in its traditional form. In addition, because of tax advantages associated with being off-shore, certain of our competitors have been able to reinsure to their offshore affiliates and achieve higher after-tax rates of return on the NIW they write compared to on-shore mortgage insurers such as Radian Guaranty, which could allow these off-shore competitors to leverage reduced pricing to gain market share, while continuing to achieve acceptable returns on NIW. 
We also compete with governmental agencies, principally the FHA and the VA. We compete with the FHA and VA on the basis of loan limits, pricing, credit guidelines, terms of our insurance policies and loss mitigation practices. Beginning in 2008, the FHA, which historically had not been a significant competitor, substantially increased its share of the mortgage insurance market which peaked at approximately 74% in 2009. Since then, the private mortgage insurance industry generally had been recapturing market share from the FHA, primarily due to: (i) improvements in the financial strength of private mortgage insurers; (ii) the development of new products and marketing efforts directed at competing with the FHA; (iii) increases in the FHA’s pricing; (iv) the U.S. government’s pursuit of legal remedies against FHA-approved lenders related to loans insured by the FHA; and (v) various policy changes at the FHA, including the general elimination of the premium cancellation provision. We believe that we are well-positioned to effectively compete with the FHA based on our current pricing strategies. In addition, we believe that better execution for borrowers with higher FICO scores, lender preference and the inability to cancel FHA insurance for certain loans are factors that continue to provide a competitive advantage for private mortgage insurers. The FHA’s share of the total insured mortgage market (which includes FHA, VA and private mortgage insurers) was 31% in 2018, compared to 35% in 2017. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Results—Mortgage Insurance—NIW; Origination Market; Penetration Rate.” If the FHA reduces its pricing in the future, it could have a negative effect on our ability to compete with the FHA.
We also have faced increasing competition from the VA. Based on publicly available information, the VA’s share of the total insured mortgage market was 25% in 2018. We believe that the VA’s market share has generally been increasing because the VA offers 100% LTV loans and charges a one-time funding fee that can be included in the loan amount with no additional monthly expense, and because of an increase in the number of borrowers that are eligible for the VA’s program.
In addition, as market conditions change, alternatives to traditional private mortgage insurance may become more prevalent, which could reduce the demand for private mortgage insurance in its traditional form, including structures commonly referred to as “investor paid mortgage insurance” in which affiliates of traditional mortgage insurers directly insure the GSEs against loss. For additional information about these structures, see “Regulation—Federal Regulation—Housing Finance Reform.” It is difficult to predict what other types of credit risk transfer transactions and other structures might be used by the GSEs in the future. If any of the credit risk transfer transactions and structures that are being developed were to displace primary loan level, standard levels of mortgage insurance, the amount of insurance we write may be reduced.
See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our mortgage insurance business faces intense competition.”

•Red Bell, a real estate brokerage, valuation and technology company, in March 2015;
•ValuAmerica, a title insurance agency and appraisal management company, in October 2015;
•EnTitle Direct, a national title insurance and settlement services company, in March 2018;

• | Independent Settlement Services, a technology-driven national appraisal and title management services company, in November 2018; and

Services Business Overview
Overview
Our Services segment offers a broad array of services to market participants across the mortgage and real estate value chain. These services comprise mortgage services, real estate services and title services, including technology and turn-key solutions, that provide information and other resources used to originate, evaluate, acquire, securitize, service and monitor residential real estate and loans secured by residential real estate. These services are primarily provided to mortgage lenders, financial institutions, investors and government entities. In addition, we provide title insurance to mortgage lenders as well as directly to borrowers.
Our mortgage services help loan originators and investors evaluate, acquire, surveil and securitize mortgages. These services include loan review, RMBS securitization and distressed asset reviews, review and valuation services related to single family rental properties, servicer and loan surveillance and underwriting. Our real estate services help lenders, investors and real estate agents evaluate, manage, monitor and sell properties. These real estate services include software as a service solutions and platforms, as well as managed services, such as REO asset management, real estate valuation services and real estate brokerage services. Our title services provide a comprehensive suite of title insurance products, title settlement services and both traditional and digital closing services. 
A key element of our overall business strategy is to use our Services segment to diversify our business and revenue streams by increasing our participation in multiple facets of the residential real estate and mortgage finance markets. In 2017, we undertook a strategic review of our Services business and made several decisions with respect to the business strategy to reposition this business to drive future growth and profitability. Following this strategic review, we committed to a restructuring plan and have refined our Services business strategy to focus on a more limited set of services. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Overview-Business Strategy.” We believe that the combination of our mortgage insurance with our unique set of diversified mortgage, real estate and title services provides us with an opportunity to become increasingly more relevant to our customers and is a competitive differentiator for us compared to other private mortgage insurance companies.
Services Offered
Mortgage Services. Our mortgage services loan review and surveillance products help customers understand risk associated with originating, buying, selling and servicing pools of loans. In this business, we primarily provide loan-level due diligence for various asset classes (residential, single family rental and non-residential) and securitizations, including single family rental and other private label securitizations and securitizations of GSE loans, with offerings focused on credit underwriting, regulatory compliance, compliance with representation and warranties and collateral valuation. Our engagements may take place, among other contexts, prior to or after the sale of a pool of loans, in connection with securitizations, transactions involving warehouse lines of credit, GSE credit risk transfer transactions and transactions involving master servicing rights.

As part of our underwriting services, we offer contract underwriting services and compliance reviews to verify that loan file documentation conforms to specified guidelines and regulatory requirements. In our contract underwriting business we underwrite our customers’ mortgage loan application files for secondary market compliance (e.g., for sale to the GSEs), and may concurrently assess the file for mortgage insurance eligibility. Generally, we offer limited indemnification to our contract underwriting customers. We train our underwriters, require them to complete continuing education and routinely audit their performance to monitor the accuracy and consistency of underwriting practices.
We offer a full range of services to support the single family rental asset class. Our comprehensive single family rental services provide a centralized, single point of contact for facilitating the valuation, diligence and underwriting services needed to support single family rental securitizations, multi-borrower transactions and warehouse facilities. 
Our surveillance services utilize data, technology and skilled professionals to provide ongoing, independent monitoring of mortgage servicer and loan performance. We offer risk management and servicing oversight solutions, including RMBS and single family rental securitization surveillance, regulatory and operational loan level oversight and asset representation review services in connection with securitizations. RMBS surveillance services monitor the servicers of mortgage loans underlying outstanding RMBS. Regulatory and operational loan level oversight provides regular monitoring of servicing operations to measure and assess compliance with applicable policies and regulations. Our asset representation review services provide targeted loan and receivable oversight for ABS issuers and their investors, including on asset classes other than mortgage loans, in the event of certain default triggers within the ABS.
Real Estate Services. Our real estate services provide data, analytics, process technologies, REO asset management and residential property valuation services to financial institutions, the GSEs, and private investment funds to support the acquisition, sale and management of real estate properties. 
Our real estate services include: full appraisal products; property inspection/condition reports; appraisal review products; hybrid/ancillary appraisal products; automated valuation products; broker price opinions (BPOs); asset watch; and rental analysis. These valuation services primarily are provided to originators, owners, purchasers and servicers of, and to investors in, performing and non-performing mortgage loans and REO properties.
We further provide asset management services that include turn-key and component solutions for REO asset management, single family rental services and transition financing services management. These services are designed to support the management of the entire REO disposition process, including management of the eviction and redemption process, as well as property preservation and repairs.
Title Services. We also offer a comprehensive suite of title, closing and settlement services for residential mortgage loans. We offer title insurance as well as a full complement of title services that include tax and title data services; centralized recording services; document retrieval; default curative title services; deed reports; and property reports. Our closing and settlement services include electronic execution of some or all mortgage loan closing documents in a secure digital environment (eClosing), including full eClosing, hybrid eClosing and remote eClosing, as well as signing services, centralized closing and settlement services and local closing and settlement services.
Services Revenue Drivers
For the most significant revenue drivers for our Services business, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Results—Services.”
Fee-for-Service Contracts
Our Services segment is primarily a fee-for-service business. Our services revenue is generated under three basic types of contracts:
Fixed-Price Contracts. Under fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the specified services and deliverables for a pre-determined per-unit or per-file price or day rate. We use fixed-price contracts in our real estate valuation and component services, our loan review, underwriting and due diligence services as well as our title and closing services. We also use fixed-price contracts in our surveillance business for our servicer oversight services and RMBS surveillance services, and in our asset management business activities.
Time-and-Expense Contracts. Under a time-and-expense contract, we are paid a fixed hourly rate, and we are reimbursed for billable out-of-pocket expenses as work is performed. These contracts are used in our loan review, underwriting and due diligence services.
 28

Part I Item 1. Business
______________________________________________________________________________________________________

Percentage-of-Sale Contracts. Under percentage-of-sale contracts, we are paid a contractual percentage of the sale proceeds upon the sale of each property. These contracts are only used for a portion of our REO management services and our real estate brokerage services. In addition, through the use of our proprietary technology, property leads are sent to select clients. Upon the client’s successful closing on the property, we recognize revenue for these transactions based on a percentage of the sale.
In most cases, our contracts with our clients do not include minimum volume commitments and can be terminated at any time by our clients. Although some of our contracts and assignments are recurring in nature, and include repetitive monthly assignments, a significant portion of our engagements are transactional in nature and may be performed in connection with securitizations, loan sales, loan purchases or other transactions. Due to the transactional nature of our business, our Services segment revenues may fluctuate from period to period as transactions are commenced or completed. In addition, our segment revenues are impacted by the origination volumes of our customers, which may fluctuate from period to period.
Title Insurance Premiums
In addition to the fees for services discussed above, we earn net premiums on title insurance written by EnTitle Insurance. 
Customers
We have a broad range of customers for our Services segment due to the breadth of services we are able to offer across the mortgage value chain. Our principal third-party customers are:

• | Banks, credit unions, independent mortgage banks and other originators of mortgage loans;


• | RMBS/ABS issuers, securitization trusts, the GSEs, private equity, hedge funds, real estate investment trusts, investment banks and other investors in mortgage-related debt instruments, whole loans and other securities;


• | Owners of single family rental homes;


• | Mortgage servicers;


• | Real estate brokers and agents; and


• | Regulators and rating agencies involved in the mortgage, real estate and housing finance markets.

Our customers include many of the largest financial institutions and participants in the mortgage sector and, as such, our services revenue is concentrated among our largest customers. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the top 10 Services customers generated approximately 42% of the Services segment’s services revenue. See “—Services Business Overview—Services Revenue Drivers.”
Competition
We believe our Services business is uniquely positioned as a single provider of an array of services to participants across the residential mortgage and real estate value chain. We are not aware of any other mortgage insurance company that provides a comparable range of services to the residential mortgage and real estate industries. However, our Services business has multiple competitors within each of its individual lines of business. Our competitors mainly include small privately-held companies and subsidiaries of large publicly-traded companies.
Significant competitors include:

• | Mortgage Services - American Mortgage Consultants, Inc., Digital Risk, LLC, Opus Capital Markets Consultants, LLC, FTI Consulting, Inc., Pentalpha Surveillance LLC, TENA Companies, Inc., Adfitech Inc. and Navigant Consulting, Inc.


• | Real Estate Services - ClearCapital.com, Inc., CoreLogic, Inc., Pro Teck Valuation Services, First American Financial Corporation, Black Knight, Inc., VRM Mortgage Services, Fidelity National Financial, Inc. and ServiceLink


• | Title Services - First American Financial Corporation, Fidelity National Financial, Inc., Stewart Information Services Corporation, Old Republic Title Insurance Group, Inc., Westcor Land Title Insurance Company and WFG National Title Insurance Company

Across all business lines, we compete on the basis of industry expertise, price, technology, service levels and relationships.

We believe that combining our mortgage insurance franchise with our diversified set of mortgage and real estate products and services provides us with an opportunity to become increasingly relevant to our customers and enhances our ability to compete in the insured market by differentiating us from other mortgage insurance competitors.
Enterprise Sales and Marketing 
Our enterprise sales and marketing team is centralized to create a unified focus on selling all of our mortgage insurance and mortgage and real estate products and services across our customer base. Our Enterprise sales and marketing team offers a coordinated sales effort under single management and is supported by dedicated business unit and account management teams organized in various geographic regions across the U.S., as well as a telesales team located in our corporate headquarters in Philadelphia. At the enterprise level, we have a senior sales executive dedicated to each of the following areas: credit unions, banking institutions, investment bankers/private equity and fund managers, mortgage bankers, GSEs and servicers. We expect that our enterprise approach to selling the complementary products and services of our Mortgage Insurance and Services businesses will strengthen our relationships with our customers, attract new customers and enhance our ability to compete.
Our Mortgage Insurance dedicated business unit sales team includes a business development group that is focused on developing new mortgage insurance relationships and an account management group that is responsible for supporting our existing mortgage insurance relationships.
Our Services dedicated business unit sales team includes a title services sales team focused on developing new title services relationships and expanding and supporting existing customer relationships, and a mortgage and real estate services team responsible for selling other services offered by our Services business.
All sales efforts are supported by our telesales team that serves customers using any and all of our products and services, and is responsible for managing and growing customer relationships and promoting increased customer adoption.
All sales personnel are compensated by salary, and other incentive-based pay, which may be tied to the achievement of certain business objectives and sales goals or the promotion of certain products. 
Customer Support
We have developed training programs for our customers to help their employees develop the knowledge and skills to respond to changing market demands. Our learning solutions are provided to customers to promote the role of private mortgage insurance in the marketplace as well as to promote Radian’s specific products and offerings. We offer training in three format options: instructor-led classroom sessions, instructor-led webinars and self-directed on-demand learning.
Sale of Financial Guaranty Business 
Radian completed the sale of Radian Asset Assurance Inc. to Assured Guaranty Corp. on April 1, 2015 and exited the financial guaranty business. Radian Asset Assurance provided direct insurance and reinsurance on credit-based structured finance and public finance risks. 
Investment Policy and Portfolio
Our investment portfolio is our primary source of claims paying resources.
We have developed an investment strategy that uses an asset allocation methodology that considers our business environment and consolidated risks as well as current investment conditions. With respect to our fixed income investments, the following internal investment policy guidelines, among others, are applied at the time of investment:

• | At least 75% of our fixed income portfolio, based on market value, must consist of investment securities that are assigned a quality designation of NAIC 1 by the NAIC or equivalent ratings by a nationally recognized statistical ratings organization (“NRSRO”) (i.e., “A-” or better by S&P and “A3” or better by Moody’s);


• | A maximum of 25% of our fixed income portfolio, based on market value, may consist of investment securities that are assigned a quality designation of NAIC 2 by the NAIC or equivalent ratings by a NRSRO (i.e., “BBB+” to “BBB-” by S&P and “Baa1” to “Baa3” by Moody’s); and


• | A maximum of 10% of our fixed income portfolio, based on market value, may consist of investment securities that are assigned quality designations NAIC 3 through 6 or equivalent ratings by a NRSRO (i.e., “BB+” and below by S&P and “Ba1” and below by Moody’s).

Our portfolio has been constructed to maximize long-term expected returns while maintaining an acceptable risk level. Our investment objectives are to utilize appropriate risk management oversight to optimize after-tax returns, while preserving capital. We target the level of our short-term investments to manage our expected short-term cash requirements.
Our investment policies and strategies are subject to change, depending on regulatory, economic and market conditions and our then-existing or anticipated financial condition and operating requirements, including our current and future tax positions. The investments held at our insurance subsidiaries are also subject to insurance regulatory requirements applicable to such insurance subsidiaries.
Oversight responsibility of our investment portfolio rests with management, and allocations are set by periodic asset allocation studies, calibrated by risk, return and after-tax considerations. The risks we consider include, among others, duration, liquidity, market, interest rate and credit risks. As of December 31, 2018, we internally manage 6.8% of the investment portfolio (the portion of the portfolio largely consisting of U.S. Treasury obligations, money market funds and certain exchange-traded funds), with the remainder primarily managed by three external managers. External managers are selected by management based primarily upon the selected allocations, as well as factors such as historical returns and stability of their management teams. Management’s selections are presented to and approved by the Finance and Investment Committee of Radian Group’s board of directors.
At December 31, 2018, our investment portfolio had a cost basis of $5.3 billion and a carrying value of $5.2 billion, which includes $0.6 billion of investments maturing within one year or less. Our investment portfolio did not include any direct residential real estate or whole mortgage loans at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2018, 97.1% of our investment portfolio was rated investment grade.

Enterprise Risk Management 
Risk Philosophy, Vision and Appetite
As a financial services organization, risk management is a critical part of our business. Our ERM vision is to remain one of the housing industry’s leading risk management organizations by providing solutions that effectively identify, assess and profitably manage risks across the entire mortgage life-cycle. The following goals guide our strategy and actions as a risk management organization:

• | Embed and continually reinforce a disciplined, corporate-wide risk culture that utilizes an understanding of risk/return tradeoffs to drive quality decisions, utilizing a disciplined approach designed to achieve long-term, through-the-cycle profitability;


• | Maintain credit, underwriting and risk/return disciplines based on sound data and analytics and continuous feedback throughout the organization;


• | Proactively monitor origination, portfolio and market trends to identify and mitigate emerging risks;


• | Continually refine analytical and technological capabilities, processes and systems to effectively identify, assess and manage risks; and


• | Develop and leverage tools and capabilities to analyze the risk/return trade-offs of corporate strategy and business decisions in order to inform and optimize capital allocation.

Our risk appetite is driven by our business strategy, which is established by executive management and overseen by Radian’s board of directors. Risk appetite is defined as the amount of risk, on a broad level, that an organization is willing to take on in pursuit of value. Based on our risk appetite, management then determines our risk tolerances. Risk tolerances represent the typical measures of risk used to monitor exposure in a particular risk category or for a specific initiative, compared with the stated risk appetite. The illustration below depicts our framework for developing risk appetite and tolerance.
We define our risk appetite qualitatively through the key risk categories where strategic execution can take place. We develop risk appetite statements that are designed to achieve the following:

• | Define the risk Radian is willing to accept and manage in pursuit of long-term value on a risk-adjusted basis;


• | Incorporate risk management into our strategic planning process;


• | Enhance risk understanding and awareness at the board and executive management levels;


• | Develop risk tolerances for business units within the context of the defined risk appetite; and


• | Improve the quality of decision-making on significant business decisions.

Risk Categories
Our key risk categories are:

• | Credit: The risk of default or failure to fulfill a financial obligation in a timely manner;


• | Financial: The risk of market forces on the ability to meet financial obligations;


• | Strategic: The risk of failure to properly respond to changes in the business environment;


• | Operational: The risk that business practices, processes, policies and systems are not adequate to meet enterprise objectives; and


• | Regulatory and Compliance: The risk of non-compliance with laws, rules, regulations and prescribed practices in any jurisdiction in which the business operates.

We do not identify reputational risk as a distinct category of risk. Rather, we view reputational risk as pervasive throughout our entire risk portfolio, as each risk on its own can impact our reputation if not mitigated or managed properly.

Risk Governance 
Our ERM program is subject to a comprehensive governance structure, as illustrated in the following chart and further described below. 
Board of Directors. The full board of directors is responsible for the general oversight of risks. Our board of directors seeks to understand and oversee the most critical risks relating to our business, allocates responsibilities for the oversight of risks among the full board and its committees, and reviews the systems and processes that management has in place to manage the current risks facing Radian, as well as those that could arise in the future.
The full board of directors oversees our strategic risks, regulatory risks, risks related to our information technology activities and cyber security risks. As noted above, the board conducts certain aspects of its risk oversight function through the following board committees: Audit Committee; Credit Management Committee; Finance and Investment Committee; Governance Committee; and Compensation and Human Resources Committee.
Each Committee Chair provides regular reports to the full board regarding the Committee’s specific risk oversight responsibilities. The board regularly meets with management to receive reports derived from (i) our ERM function regarding the most significant risks we are facing, and the steps being taken to assess, manage and mitigate those risks; and (ii) the Company’s information security function regarding cybersecurity risks and the Company’s efforts to mitigate such risks. The full board further considers current and potential future strategic risks facing the company as part of its annual strategic planning session with management.

Integrated ERM Framework. We have adopted an integrated approach to risk management, which includes: (i) a centralized ERM function that resides within the office of our Chief Financial Officer and is responsible for overseeing the process for risk identification, assessment, management and mitigation across the organization; (ii) various management committees that oversee specific risks; (iii) business units that manage specific risks associated with their business activities; and (iv) an internal audit function that performs periodic, independent reviews and tests compliance with risk management policies, procedures and standards across the company.
The various management committees include, but are not limited to, a Pricing and Credit Committee, a Capital and Liquidity Review Committee and a Model Governance Committee (collectively “ALCO”), an Information Security and Resilience Committee, a Regulatory Compliance Council, a Mortgage Insurance Reserve Committee, a Title Insurance Underwriting Committee, a Title Insurance Claims Committee and an Enterprise Data Governance Committee.
Our integrated ERM framework is designed to identify the risks we are facing, and to assess, manage and mitigate those risks. Our ERM process is designed to provide executive management with the ability to evaluate the most significant concerns we face and to calibrate the risk mitigation strategies to account for challenges in the current business environment, as well as external factors that may negatively impact our operations. The risks that fall under the program span the entire spectrum of organizational risks and include risks that may not be easily quantifiable or measurable. These include critical risks that fall into our credit, financial, operational, regulatory and compliance, and strategic risk categories. Enterprise level risk reviews are conducted for both our Mortgage Insurance and Services businesses.
Our ERM process is illustrated in the following chart:
Our ERM program takes a holistic approach to managing risks that we face in our businesses. A cross-functional team, guided by subject matter experts and experienced managers, follows a systematic method to identify, evaluate and monitor both known and emerging risks. Our ERM program is a dynamic process, which includes ongoing analysis and ranking of the most significant risks and the alignment of risk management activities with business strategies. Risk assessments and mitigation plans are developed to address these risks. These assessments and plans are subject to review and modification to account for changes in markets and the regulatory environment, as well as other internal or external factors.

the effectiveness of risk management plans through management reporting facilitate program sustainability and promote accountability for risk management activities throughout the company.
An ERM Council, consisting of mid-senior level employees, meets at least quarterly to review the organization’s top risks, as well as any risks that may have been upgraded or downgraded during the review cycle. The output (reports, dashboards, etc.) from the ERM Council is consolidated and presented to an ERM Executive Steering Committee (consisting of executive management) at least quarterly. The ERM Executive Steering Committee, along with the ERM Council, is responsible for assisting the board of directors in the fulfillment of its risk oversight responsibilities.
Radian currently employs more than 60 dedicated risk management professionals and has developed and established credit, portfolio, and counterparty risk policies, enterprise risk management policies, procedures for monitoring compliance with these policies and comprehensive capabilities and tools to identify, communicate, and mitigate credit and risk-related issues.
Mortgage Insurance Risk Management
Our mortgage insurance business employs a comprehensive risk management function, which is responsible for establishing our credit and counterparty risk policies, monitoring compliance with our policies, managing our insured portfolio and communicating credit related issues to management, the Credit Management Committee of Radian Group’s board of directors and to our customers.
Risk Origination and Servicing. We believe that understanding our business partners and customers is a key component of managing risk. Accordingly, we assign individual risk managers to specific customers so that they can more effectively perform ongoing monitoring of loan performance, underwriting quality and the risk profile and mix of business of a customer’s mortgage insurance applications. This also allows us to address specific needs of individual customers. The risk managers are located across the country, and their direct interaction with our customers and their access to local markets improves our ability to observe business patterns and manage risk trends. This oversight provides us with the ability to review and study best practices throughout the industry and develop robust data management analysis. The risk managers leverage a suite of customer-level reports to monitor trends at the customer level, identify customers who may exceed certain risk tolerances, and share meaningful data with our customers. The risk managers are also responsible for lender corrective action in the event we discover credit performance issues, such as high early payment default levels.
Portfolio Management. We have developed risk and capital allocation models that support our mortgage insurance business. These models provide robust analysis to establish portfolio limits for product type, loan attributes, geographic concentrations and counterparties. We proactively monitor market concentrations across these and other attributes. We also identify, evaluate and negotiate potential transactions for terminating insurance risk and for distributing risk to others, including through reinsurance arrangements. See “—Ceded Reinsurance” for more information about the use of reinsurance as a risk management tool in our mortgage insurance business.
As part of our portfolio management function, we monitor and analyze the performance of various risks in our mortgage insurance portfolio. We use this information to develop our mortgage credit risk and counterparty risk policies, and as a component of our default and prepayment analytics.
The portfolio management group analyzes the current composition of our mortgage insurance portfolio, and assesses risks to the portfolio from the market (e.g., the effects of changes in home prices and interest rates) as well as risks from particular lenders, products and geographic locales.
Credit Policy. We have developed and maintain mortgage-related credit risk policies. These policies reflect our tolerance levels regarding counterparty, portfolio and operational risks involving mortgage collateral. Our credit policy function develops and updates our mortgage insurance eligibility and guidelines through regular monitoring of competitor offerings, customer input regarding lending needs, analysis of historical performance and portfolio trends, quality assurance results, underwriter experience and observations and risk tolerances. The credit policy function also maintains the policies for loan and lender-level exceptions to published guidelines and under-performing lenders, which are administered by mortgage insurance underwriters and risk managers. The credit policy function works closely with our mortgage insurance underwriters to ensure that underwriting decisions align with risk tolerances and principles.
Quality Assurance. Quality assurance is a key element of our credit analytics function, and as part of our quality control program, we audit individual loan files to examine underwriting decisions for compliance with agreed-upon underwriting guidelines. These audits are conducted across loans submitted through our delegated and non-delegated underwriting channels. Our quality assurance team audits both our customers and our underwriters to ensure quality in our NIW. Observations and trends derived from our quality assurance process serve as critical inputs into portfolio monitoring, eligibility and guideline

updates and customer surveillance, while also providing valuable feedback to our customers and our underwriters regarding the quality of their mortgage insurance underwriting decisions.
Loss Mitigation. We have a dedicated loss mitigation group that works with servicers to identify and pursue loss mitigation opportunities for loans in both our performing and non-performing (defaulted) portfolios. This includes regular surveillance and benchmarking of servicer performance with respect to default reporting, borrower retention efforts, foreclosure alternatives and foreclosure processing. Through this process, we seek to hold servicers accountable for their performance and communicate to servicers identified best practices for servicer performance.
Risk Modeling. We have expertise in the development and deployment of integrated credit and interest rate risk models. Using analytical techniques, we have developed loan level default and prepayment models for a wide range of risk management applications, including portfolio analysis, credit decision making, forecasting, and reserving.
Ceded Reinsurance. Radian’s reinsurance programs represent a component of our long-term risk distribution strategy. We use reinsurance as a capital and risk management tool in our mortgage insurance business. We have entered into third-party reinsurance transactions as part of our capital and risk management activities, including quota share reinsurance programs that are utilized to proactively manage Radian Guaranty’s capital position under the PMIERs financial requirements, and manage the mix of business in our portfolio. During 2018, we expanded our risk distribution strategy in an effort to optimize the amounts and types of capital and risk distribution deployed against insured risk. The objectives of our risk distribution strategy include: (i) supporting our overall capital plans; (ii) lowering our cost of capital; and (iii) reducing portfolio risk and financial volatility through economic cycles. For additional information regarding our third-party quota share reinsurance programs, see Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Cybersecurity Risk Management
Information security is a significant operational risk for financial institutions such as Radian and includes the risk of loss resulting from cyber-attacks. In an effort to mitigate this risk, Radian has built an Information Security Program that is dedicated to protecting our corporate data as well as data entrusted to us by our customers and partners. At the core of our program is a defense-in-depth strategy, which utilizes multiple layers of security controls to protect data and solutions. Radian utilizes the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (the “NIST CSF”), as a guideline to manage our cybersecurity-related risk. The NIST CSF outlines 98 information security measures over five functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond and Recover. We have developed key security services, including but not limited to, Enterprise Data Protection, Vulnerability Management and Application Security, Managed Threat Detection and Incident Response. We test our incident response readiness and reporting through table top exercises, external and internal penetration testing and other means in our efforts to ensure that risks and incidents are escalated and communicated to appropriate personnel. 
Our commitment to growing and maintaining our Information Security Program extends across the organization. Our core Information Security Team is comprised of industry-certified practitioners who are committed to adopting security technologies and practices that meet regulatory standards. We have an Information Security and Resilience Committee comprised of company executives, cross-functional Incident Response teams, and strong governance mechanisms designed to ensure compliance with our security policies and protocols. Additionally, our full board of directors is actively engaged in the Information Security Program’s oversight and receives regular updates and reporting from the Company’s Chief Information Security Officer on information security strategies, defense initiatives, event preparedness and continuous improvement efforts. While we have an Information Security Program in place in order to attempt to prevent, detect and respond to unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information, including non-public personal information, there can be no assurance that such use or disclosure will not occur. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—The security of our information technology systems may be compromised and confidential information, including non-public personal information that we maintain, could be improperly disclosed.”
Regulation
We are subject to comprehensive regulation by both federal and state regulatory authorities. Set forth below is a description of significant state and federal regulations and other requirements of the GSEs that are applicable to our businesses. The descriptions below are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the laws and regulations discussed. In Item 1A. Risk Factors, see “—Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive state insurance regulations and other requirements, which we may fail to satisfy.” and “—Legislation and administrative and regulatory changes and interpretations could impact our businesses.”

State Regulation
Overview of State Insurance Regulation and Our Insurance Subsidiaries
We and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive regulation by the insurance departments in the various states where they are licensed to transact business. Insurance laws vary from state to state, but generally grant broad supervisory powers to agencies or officials to examine insurance companies and enforce rules or exercise discretion affecting almost every significant aspect of the insurance business. These regulations principally are designed for the protection of policyholders, rather than for the benefit of investors.
Insurance regulations address, among other things, the licensing of companies to transact business, claims handling, reinsurance requirements, premium rates and policy forms offered to customers, financial statements, periodic reporting, permissible investments and adherence to financial standards relating to surplus, dividends and other measures of solvency intended to assure the satisfaction of obligations to policyholders.
Our insurance subsidiaries’ premium rates and policy forms are generally subject to regulation in every state in which they are licensed to transact business. These regulations are intended to protect policyholders against excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory rates and to encourage competition in the insurance marketplace. In most states where our insurance subsidiaries are licensed, premium rates and policy forms must be filed with the state insurance regulatory authority and, in some states must also be approved, before their use. With respect to mortgage insurance, premium rates may be subject to actuarial justification, generally on the basis of the mortgage insurer’s loss experience, expenses and future projections. In addition, states may consider general default experience in the mortgage insurance industry in assessing the premium rates charged by mortgage insurers. As to title insurance, forms and rates must be filed, and in most states approved, prior to usage. Forms require approval to ensure that the coverage and exceptions conform to state insurance regulations. Rates subject to approval often must be supported by actuarial data or a study of financial impact of the rate on the company.
Each insurance subsidiary is required by the insurance regulatory authority of its state of domicile, and the insurance regulatory authority of each other jurisdiction in which it is licensed to transact business, to make various filings with those insurance regulatory authorities and with the NAIC, including quarterly and annual financial statements prepared in accordance with statutory accounting principles. In addition, our insurance subsidiaries are subject to examination by the insurance regulatory authority of their state of domicile, as well as each of the states in which they are licensed to transact business.
Radian Group is an insurance holding company and our mortgage insurance subsidiaries belong to an insurance holding company system. All states regulate insurance holding company systems, including the non-insurer holding company within that system. These laws generally require each insurance subsidiary within an insurance holding company system to register with the insurance regulatory authority of its domiciliary state, and to furnish to the regulators in these states applicable financial statements, statements related to intercompany transactions and other information concerning the holding company and its affiliated companies within the holding company system that may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of insurers or the holding company system.
We are subject to the insurance holding company laws of Pennsylvania and Ohio because all of our mortgage insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in Pennsylvania and EnTitle is domiciled in Ohio. These insurance holding company laws regulate, among other things, certain transactions between Radian Group, our insurance subsidiaries and other parties affiliated with us. The holding company laws of Pennsylvania also govern certain transactions involving Radian Group’s common stock, including transactions that constitute a “change of control” of Radian Group and, consequently, a “change of control” of its insurance subsidiaries. Specifically, no person may, directly or indirectly, seek to acquire “control” of Radian Group or any of its mortgage insurance subsidiaries unless that person files a statement and other documents with the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner and receives prior approval from the Commissioner. Under Pennsylvania’s insurance statutes, “control” is defined broadly and is “presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with power to vote or holds proxies representing 10% or more of the voting securities” of a holding company of a Pennsylvania domestic insurer. The statute further defines “control” as the “possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of” an insurer.
In addition, material transactions between us or our affiliates and our insurance subsidiaries or among our insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain conditions, including that they be “fair and reasonable.” These conditions generally apply to all persons controlling, or who are under common control with, us or our insurance subsidiaries. Certain transactions between us or our affiliates and our insurance subsidiaries may not be entered into unless the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner or Ohio Department of Insurance, as applicable, is given 30 days’ prior notification and does not disapprove the transaction during that 30-day period.

Pennsylvania and Ohio regulations also require that we identify the material risks within the insurance holding company system that could pose enterprise risk to the insurer. Among other things, Pennsylvania and Ohio require that insurers domiciled in their states maintain a risk management framework and conduct an Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (“ORSA”) annually in accordance with applicable NAIC requirements.
All of our mortgage insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in Pennsylvania. Listed below are our principal insurance companies as of December 31, 2018: 

• | Radian Guaranty. Radian Guaranty is our primary mortgage insurance company. Radian Guaranty is a direct subsidiary of Radian Group. Radian Guaranty is our only mortgage insurance company that is eligible to provide mortgage insurance on GSE loans. It is a monoline insurer, restricted to writing first-lien residential mortgage guaranty insurance. In addition to Pennsylvania, Radian Guaranty is authorized to write mortgage guaranty insurance (or in states where there is no specific authorization for mortgage guaranty insurance, the applicable line of insurance under which mortgage guaranty insurance is regulated) in each of the other 49 states, the District of Columbia and Guam.


• | Radian Reinsurance. Radian Reinsurance is a licensed affiliated reinsurer that primarily provides reinsurance to Radian Guaranty. Radian Reinsurance is a direct subsidiary of Radian Group. We also use Radian Reinsurance to participate in the Front-end and Back-end credit risk transfer programs developed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. See “Mortgage Insurance—Mortgage Insurance Business Overview—Mortgage Insurance Products—Other Mortgage Insurance Products—GSE Credit Risk Transfer” for more information about these programs.


• | Radian Insurance. Radian Insurance is our insurance subsidiary that insures our remaining second-lien mortgage loan risk. Radian Insurance is a direct subsidiary of Radian Group. Previously, Radian Insurance also insured our Hong Kong insurance portfolio. As of December 31, 2018, we had no remaining RIF in Hong Kong.

In addition, we have the following mortgage insurance subsidiaries, each of which had no RIF as of December 31, 2018: Radian Investor Surety Inc., Radian Mortgage Guaranty Inc., Radian Guaranty Reinsurance and Radian Mortgage Assurance.
As part of our title services we offer title insurance through EnTitle Insurance, an Ohio domiciled title insurance underwriter and settlement services company that is licensed to issue title insurance policies in 39 states and the District of Columbia. EnTitle Insurance is a wholly owned subsidiary of EnTitle Direct, which we acquired on March 27, 2018. As an insurance company, EnTitle Insurance is subject to comprehensive regulation by the insurance departments in the various states where it is licensed to transact business and subject to examination by the insurance regulatory authority of its state of domicile, the Ohio Department of Insurance.
Mortgage Insurance Capital Requirements and Dividends
Under state insurance regulations, Radian Guaranty is required to maintain minimum surplus levels and, in certain states, a minimum ratio of statutory capital relative to the level of net RIF, or Risk-to-capital. Sixteen states currently impose a Statutory RBC Requirement. The most common Statutory RBC Requirement is that a mortgage insurer’s Risk-to-capital may not exceed 25 to 1. In certain of the RBC States, Radian Guaranty must satisfy a MPP Requirement. The statutory capital requirements for the non-RBC States are de minimis (ranging from $1 million to $5 million); however, the insurance laws of these states generally grant broad supervisory powers to state agencies or officials to enforce rules or exercise discretion affecting almost every significant aspect of the insurance business, including the power to revoke or restrict an insurance company’s ability to write new business. Unless an RBC State grants a waiver or other form of relief, if a mortgage insurer, such as Radian Guaranty, is not in compliance with the Statutory RBC Requirement of that state, it may be prohibited from writing new mortgage insurance business in that state. Radian Guaranty’s domiciliary state, Pennsylvania, is not one of the RBC States. In 2018 and 2017, the RBC States accounted for approximately 55.0% and 55.1%, respectively, of Radian Guaranty’s total primary NIW. As of December 31, 2018, Radian Guaranty’s Risk-to-capital was 13.9 to 1, and Radian Guaranty was in compliance with all applicable Statutory RBC Requirements. 
The NAIC is in the process of reviewing the minimum capital and surplus requirements for mortgage insurers and considering changes to the Model Act. In May 2016, a working group of state regulators released an exposure draft of a risk-based capital framework to establish capital requirements for mortgage insurers. The process for developing this framework is ongoing. While the timing and outcome of this process remains uncertain, in the event the NAIC adopts changes to the Model Act, we expect that the capital requirements in states that adopt the new Model Act may increase as a result of the changes. While we cannot provide any assurance, based on the current exposure draft, we do not believe that the capital requirements that may be adopted under the new Model Act are likely to exceed those of the PMIERs financial requirements. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive state insurance regulations and other requirements, which we may fail to satisfy.”

Part I Item 1. Business
______________________________________________________________________________________________________

Under Pennsylvania’s insurance laws, dividends and other distributions may only be paid out of an insurer’s positive unassigned surplus, measured as of the end of the prior fiscal year, unless the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner approves the payment of dividends or other distributions from another source. While all proposed dividends and distributions to stockholders must be filed with the Pennsylvania Insurance Department prior to payment, if a Pennsylvania domiciled insurer had positive unassigned surplus as of the end of the prior fiscal year, then unless the prior approval of the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner is obtained, such insurer could only pay dividends or other distributions during any 12-month period in an aggregate amount less than or equal to the greater of: (i) 10% of the preceding year-end statutory policyholders’ surplus; or (ii) the preceding year’s statutory net income.
At December 31, 2018, although Radian Guaranty and Radian Reinsurance had statutory policyholders' surplus of $814.1 million and $356.2 million, respectively, both companies had negative unassigned surplus balances, primarily due to the need for mortgage guaranty insurers to establish and maintain contingency reserves. Radian Guaranty and Radian Reinsurance had negative unassigned surplus at December 31, 2018 of $701.9 million and $84.8 million, respectively, therefore no ordinary dividends or other distributions can be paid by these subsidiaries in 2019 without approval from the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner. Because they also had negative unassigned surplus positions at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, neither Radian Guaranty nor Radian Reinsurance was able to pay any ordinary dividends in 2018 or 2017. Due in part to the need to set aside contingency reserves, which are not included in an insurer’s statutory surplus as discussed below, we do not expect that Radian Guaranty or Radian Reinsurance will have positive unassigned surplus, and therefore we expect that they will not have the ability to pay ordinary dividends, for the foreseeable future. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Pennsylvania Insurance Department approved a $450 million distribution of capital from Radian Guaranty to Radian Group, which was paid on December 21, 2018. See Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of this distribution of capital and another Extraordinary Distribution that was paid from Radian Guaranty to Radian Group in 2017 in connection with the reallocation of capital among our mortgage insurance subsidiaries.
All of our other mortgage insurance subsidiaries also had negative unassigned surplus at December 31, 2018. Therefore, no ordinary dividends or other distributions can be paid by these subsidiaries in 2019 without approval from the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner.
For statutory reporting, mortgage insurance companies are required annually to set aside contingency reserves in an amount equal to 50% of earned premiums. Such amounts cannot be released into surplus for a period of 10 years, except when loss ratios exceed 35%, in which case the amount above 35% can be released under certain circumstances. The contingency reserve, which is designed to be a reserve against catastrophic losses, essentially restricts dividends and other distributions by mortgage insurance companies. We classify the contingency reserves of our mortgage insurance subsidiaries as a statutory liability. At December 31, 2018, Radian Guaranty and Radian Reinsurance had contingency reserves of $2.1 billion, and $293.5 million, respectively.
Title Insurance Capital Requirements and Dividends
EnTitle Insurance is required to maintain Statutory Premium Reserves (“SPR”), calculated as a percentage of gross premium collected. The SPR requirements are set by each state, with the most common being 7%. The SPR is then recovered based on a release schedule, amortized over twenty years. In addition to the SPR, EnTitle Insurance is subject to periodic reviews of certain financial performance ratios, and the states in which it is licensed can impose capital requirements on EnTitle Insurance based on the results of those ratios. 
Under Ohio’s insurance laws, dividends and other distributions may only be paid out of an insurer’s positive unassigned surplus, measured as of the end of the prior fiscal year, unless the Ohio Department of Insurance approves the payment of dividends or other distributions from another source. While all proposed dividends and distributions to stockholders must be filed with the Ohio Department of Insurance prior to payment, if an Ohio domiciled insurer had positive unassigned surplus as of the end of the prior fiscal year, then unless the prior approval of the Ohio Department of Insurance is obtained, such insurer could only pay dividends or other distributions during any 12-month period in an aggregate amount less than or equal to the greater of: (i) 10% of the preceding year-end statutory policyholders’ surplus; or (ii) the preceding year’s statutory net income. EnTitle Insurance had negative unassigned surplus at December 31, 2018 of $23.9 million, therefore it is unable to pay ordinary dividends or other distributions in 2019 without approval from the Ohio Department of Insurance.
In September of 2017, the New York State Department of Financial Services (“DFS”) issued 11 NYCRR 228 (“Regulation 208”) which regulates title insurance marketing practices, expenses and transaction related charges in the state of New York. Regulation 208 limits or bans title underwriters and agents from charging consumers certain title and closing related fees, and contains strict rules around marketing expenses aimed at restricting or stopping certain marketing practices in the title industry. Radian Settlement Services and EnTitle Insurance have adjusted their transaction fees and marketing practices and 
 41

expenses to comply with Regulation 208. Regulation 208 also requires that title insurance underwriters retroactively affirm that they and their agents have not charged fees over the past six years in excess of those amounts which are now limited or expenses which are now banned. If a title insurance underwriter cannot affirm that it or its agents did not charge fees in excess of those allowed under Regulation 208 over the last six years, it will need to submit a reduced rate filing to come into compliance. On February 13, 2019, EnTitle Insurance submitted its reduced rate filing to comply with Regulation 208. DFS approved EnTitle’s reduced rate filing on February 15, 2019.
Mortgage, Real Estate and Title Services
Certain of our Services subsidiaries are subject to regulation and oversight by the states where they conduct their businesses, including requirements to be licensed and/or registered in the states in which they conduct operations. 
Our real estate brokerage businesses provide services in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, and they and their designated brokers are required to hold licenses and conduct their brokerage business in conformity with the applicable license laws and administrative regulations of the states in which they are conducting their business. As a licensed real estate brokerage, Red Bell receives residential real estate information from various multiple listing services (“MLS”) which it uses to broker real estate transactions and provide valuation products and services, pursuant to the terms of agreements with the MLS providers. If these agreements were to terminate or Red Bell otherwise were to lose access to this information, it could negatively impact Red Bell’s ability to conduct its business.
Radian Settlement Services and its affiliates provide title services and these entities are required to hold the applicable required licenses in the jurisdictions where they operate their business. Title insurance agency licensing is primarily regulated by states in which the services are being offered, with licensing and registration typically within the jurisdiction of each state’s department of insurance. Radian Settlement Services is domiciled and licensed in Pennsylvania as a resident title insurance agency and, together with its affiliates, is licensed in 32 additional states. 
Radian Settlement Services and its affiliates also serve as an appraisal management company. In 2018, Radian acquired Independent Settlement Services, a national appraisal and title management services company. Radian Settlement Services and its affiliates are licensed to provide appraisal management services in 42 states and Independent Settlement Services is licensed as an appraisal management company in 45 states. Real estate appraisal management statutes and regulations vary from state to state, but generally grant broad supervisory powers to agencies or officials to examine companies and enforce rules. While these businesses are generally state regulated, the Dodd-Frank Act established minimum requirements to be implemented by states regarding the registration and supervision of appraisal management companies. Most states have based their legislation on model legislation developed by the Appraisal Institute for the registration and oversight of appraisal management companies. Radian Settlement Services’ affiliate, ValuEscrow, Inc., is a California licensed escrow company, and is required to maintain all applicable licenses and fidelity certifications to operate in California. 
Radian Clayton Services LLC provides third party underwriting services to lenders, including services that may be deemed loan origination activities as defined by the SAFE Act (discussed below) and state law equivalents. This entity and its employees that provide our contract underwriting services are compliant with the SAFE Act in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. See “—Federal Regulation—The SAFE Act.”
Cybersecurity 
The DFS issued cybersecurity regulations that became effective March 1, 2017 and apply to all financial institutions and insurance companies licensed under the New York Banking, Insurance, and Financial Services Laws, including Radian Guaranty and certain of our other subsidiaries. The regulations require covered entities to, among other things: establish a cybersecurity program; adopt a written cybersecurity policy; designate a Chief Information Security Officer responsible for implementing, overseeing and enforcing the cybersecurity program and policy; and have policies and procedures designed to ensure the security of information systems and nonpublic information accessible to, or held by, third-parties, along with a variety of other requirements to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information systems. 
Privacy 
In June of 2018, the State of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) which applies to any company that does business in California and meets certain threshold requirements. The CCPA will become effective January 1, 2020, and the legislation requires the California Attorney General to adopt implementing regulations by July 1, 2020. While we are continuing to evaluate the applicability of the CCPA to our businesses, we believe Radian Group and certain of its affiliates may meet the CCPA threshold requirements, and therefore, may be deemed covered businesses under the CCPA. The CCPA creates a new privacy framework for covered businesses that collect, sell or disclose personal information of California consumers. The definition of protected “personal information” under the CCPA is broad, and the CCPA creates five new 
 42

Glossary
Part I Item 1. Business
______________________________________________________________________________________________________

categories of data privacy rights for California consumers: the right to (1) know what personal information is being collected about them, whether their personal information is sold or disclosed and to whom; (2) access a copy of their personal information; (3) delete their personal information from business servers and service providers, unless it is necessary to maintain the information under enumerated exceptions; (4) opt out of the sale of their personal information to third parties; and (5) have equal access and service if they exercise their rights. The CCPA provides a private right of action for data breaches, including statutory or actual damages, and public enforcement by the California Attorney General for other violations. Compliance with the CCPA will require the development of new policies, procedures and operational changes. It is reasonably possible that the CCPA will prompt other state and federal regulators to move forward with new privacy regulations that could impact our businesses or those of our customers.
GSE Requirements
PMIERs - Private Mortgage Insurer Eligibility Requirements. As the largest purchasers of conventional mortgage loans, and therefore, the main beneficiaries of private mortgage insurance, the GSEs impose eligibility requirements that private mortgage insurers must satisfy in order to be approved to insure loans purchased by the GSEs. The PMIERs initially became effective December 31, 2015, and aim to ensure that approved insurers will possess the financial and operational capacity to serve as strong counterparties to the GSEs throughout various market conditions. The PMIERs are comprehensive, covering virtually all aspects of the business and operations of a private mortgage insurer of GSE loans, including internal risk management and quality controls, the relationship between the GSEs and the approved insurer and the approved insurer’s financial condition. The PMIERs contain extensive requirements related to the conduct and operations of our mortgage insurance business, including operational requirements in areas such as claim processing, loss mitigation, document retention, underwriting, quality control, reporting and monitoring, among others. In addition, the PMIERs prohibit private mortgage insurers from engaging in certain activities such as insuring loans originated or serviced by an affiliate (except under certain circumstances) and require private mortgage insurers to obtain the prior consent of the GSEs before taking certain actions, which may include entering into various intercompany agreements and commuting or reinsuring risk, among others. Radian Guaranty currently is an approved mortgage insurer under the PMIERs and is in compliance with the PMIERs financial requirements.
The PMIERs financial requirements require that a mortgage insurer’s Available Assets meet or exceed its Minimum Required Assets. The PMIERs financial requirements include increased financial requirements for defaulted loans, as well as loans with a higher likelihood of default and/or certain credit characteristics, such as higher LTVs and lower FICO scores, and for loans originated after January 1, 2016 that are insured under lender-paid mortgage insurance policies not subject to automatic termination under the HPA. Therefore, if our mix of business includes a higher percentage of loans that are subject to these increased financial requirements, it increases the Minimum Required Assets and/or the amount of Available Assets that Radian Guaranty is required to hold. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview—Operating Environment.”
The GSEs have significant discretion under the PMIERs and may amend the PMIERs at any time, although the GSEs have communicated that for material changes, including material changes affecting Minimum Required Assets, they will generally provide written notice 180 days prior to the effective date and engage in a discussion and comment process with the private mortgage insurers regarding the proposed changes prior to finalizing them. On September 27, 2018, the GSEs issued PMIERs 2.0, which will become effective on March 31, 2019. PMIERs 2.0 eliminates any credit for future premiums for insurance policies written prior to and including 2008, which is permitted under the current PMIERs. In addition, among other changes, defaulted loans in FEMA-declared major disaster areas will require a reduced level of Minimum Required Assets under PMIERs 2.0, subject to certain requirements. Radian Guaranty expects to comply with PMIERs 2.0 as of the effective date.
We have entered into reinsurance transactions as part of our capital and risk management activities, including to manage Radian Guaranty’s capital position under the PMIERs financial requirements. The initial and ongoing credit that we receive under the PMIERs financial requirements for these transactions is subject to the periodic review of the GSEs. 
Although we expect Radian Guaranty to retain its eligibility status with the GSEs and to continue to comply with the PMIERs financial requirements, including as they may be updated, we cannot provide assurance that this will occur. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Radian Guaranty may fail to maintain its eligibility status with the GSEs.”

Other GSE Business Practices and Requirements. The GSEs, acting independently or through their conservator, the FHFA, have the ability to change their business practices and requirements in ways that impact our business. Examples of more recent changes or proposed changes in the GSEs’ business practices and requirements are:

• | the GSEs’ proposal of new minimum requirements for master insurance policies to revise the GSE Rescission Relief Principles to, among other things, further limit the circumstances under which mortgage insurers may rescind insurance coverage;


• | the changes to the PMIERs under PMIERs 2.0 that become effective on March 31, 2019; and


• | changes to underwriting standards on mortgages they purchase, including for example, the GSEs’ decision to expand credit in 2017 by purchasing a larger portion of loans with debt-to-income ratios greater than 45%.

For information on additional potential changes in GSE business practices and requirements that could impact our business, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Changes in the charters, business practices, or role of the GSEs in the U.S. housing market generally, could significantly impact our mortgage insurance business.”
Federal Regulation
Housing Finance Reform
The federal government plays a significant role in the U.S. housing finance system through, among other things, the involvement of the FHFA and GSEs, the FHA and the VA. The GSEs’ charters generally prohibit them from buying low down payment mortgage loans without certain forms of credit enhancement, the primary form of which has been private mortgage insurance. There has been ongoing debate about the roles that the federal government and private capital should play in the housing finance system, and in recent years, there generally has been broad policy consensus that there is a need to increase the role of private capital. As a significant source of private capital in the existing housing finance system, private mortgage insurance is well-positioned in recent legislative proposals to continue to be able to provide the type of coverage that has become the predominant form of credit enhancement for satisfying the requirements currently memorialized in rules implementing the GSE charters, sometimes referred to as “standard coverage.” However, to the extent new legislative action alters the existing GSE charters without explicit preservation of the role of private mortgage insurance for high-LTV loans, our business could be adversely affected. Furthermore, should legislative or administrative action, such as the imposition of higher guarantee fees or loan level price adjustments, changes to loan limits, or significantly tightening the credit underwriting standards for the GSEs, it is possible that non-GSE executions, including the “private label” secondary market or loans insured by the FHA, VA, or U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) would result in better execution or price to consumers. In such a scenario, our business could be adversely impacted.
Since FHFA was appointed as conservator of the GSEs in September 2008, there has been a wide range of legislative proposals to reform the U.S. housing finance market, including proposals for GSE reform ranging from some that advocate nearly complete privatization and elimination of the role of the GSEs to others that support a system that combines a federal role with private capital. Recent proposals have focused on making the federal guaranty of mortgage backed securities explicit, with some models proposing the repurposing of the GSEs to have them compete with other secondary market guarantors and other models proposing a broad implementation of the multiple issuer structure that exists with Ginnie Mae backed loans. In addition, the Trump administration and U.S. Treasury have stated that they are seeking to advance housing finance reform, particularly if the U.S. Congress does not take action to end the current conservatorship of the GSEs. Under current law, the FHFA has significant discretion with respect to the future state of the GSEs, including the ability to place the GSEs into receivership without further legislative action. The term of the most recent director of the FHFA ended in January 2019 and an acting director was appointed, pending the U.S. Senate’s confirmation of the Administration’s nominee to lead the FHFA. With new leadership at FHFA, we believe there may be an increased likelihood that the Administration could take action to reform the GSEs through current authorities of the director under The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 and through Executive Order. 
The U.S. Treasury currently owns the preferred stock of the GSEs pursuant to the terms of a senior preferred stock purchase agreement and was prohibited from selling its stake in the GSEs until January 1, 2018. On December 21, 2017, the FHFA and the Treasury Department reached an agreement to reinstate a $3 billion capital reserve for the GSEs under the senior preferred stock purchase agreement, allowing the GSEs to build a limited amount of reserves to allow for income fluctuations. Beyond this $3 billion capital buffer, the GSEs are required under the senior preferred stock purchase agreements to sweep all profits to the U.S. Treasury. It is possible that the U.S. Treasury could further amend the terms of the senior preferred stock purchase agreement to permit the GSEs to further retain profits and recapitalize which could, in turn, affect the prospects for comprehensive housing finance reform legislation. In June 2018, FHFA released a proposed rule to establish a CCF that would 
 44

Glossary
Part I Item 1. Business
______________________________________________________________________________________________________

apply minimum capital requirements for the GSEs, if the CCF is finalized. This rule proposes both risked-based capital requirements and would revise the minimum leverage capital requirement for the GSEs. Under this proposed rule, these requirements would only take affect once the GSEs exit conservatorship, although in the absence of greater transparency we believe the CCF provides a reasonable basis for understanding how the GSEs are currently conducting their operations, including their decisions with respect to capital allocation and pricing. If the CCF is finalized, it is reasonably possible that the GSEs will seek to more closely align the capital requirements of the PMIERs with the CCF, which could result in further changes to the PMIERs. 
In the absence of comprehensive housing finance reform legislation, the FHFA has made changes to the business and operations of the GSEs. As a mechanism for implementing changes, the FHFA uses the annual process of releasing a strategic plan for conservatorship and setting goals for the GSEs (the “Scorecard”) to meet as part of its ongoing regulation. Among other things, the 2019 Scorecard includes goals to increase access to single-family mortgage credit for creditworthy borrowers and to finalize post-financial crisis loss mitigation activities. In addition, the 2019 Scorecard calls for the GSEs to transfer a meaningful portion of credit risk, also known as “credit risk transfer,” to the private sector. The mandate for meaningful credit risk transfer builds upon the goals set in each of the last three years for the GSEs to transfer portions of their mortgage credit risk to the private sector by experimenting with different forms of transactions and structures. In response to this mandate, the GSEs have engaged in Front-end, Back-end and other credit risk transfer transactions to transfer a portion of credit risk. From 2013 through June 2018 the GSEs transferred risk on over $2.5 trillion of unpaid principal balance, and we expect these credit risk transfer transactions to continue. We have participated in both the Front-end and Back-end credit risk transfer programs developed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. For more information about these programs, see “Mortgage Insurance—Mortgage Insurance Business Overview—Mortgage Insurance Products—Non-Traditional Risk.” 
In addition, alternatives to traditional mortgage insurance may be introduced that compete with private mortgage insurance. In 2018, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae announced the launch of limited pilot programs, Integrated Mortgage Insurance (“IMAGIN”) and Enterprise-Paid Mortgage Insurance (“EPMI”), respectively, as alternative ways for lenders to sell to the GSEs loans with LTVs greater than 80%. These investor-paid mortgage insurance programs, in which insurance is acquired directly by each GSE, have many of the same features as and represent an alternative to traditional private mortgage insurance products that are provided to individual lenders. Participants in IMAGIN and EPMI are not subject to compliance with the PMIERs, which may create a competitive disadvantage for private mortgage insurers if these pilot programs are expanded. 
It is difficult to predict what other types of credit risk transfer transactions and other structures might be used by the GSEs in the future. If any of the credit risk transfer transactions and structures that are being developed were to displace primary loan level, standard levels of mortgage insurance, the amount of insurance we write may be reduced. However, the GSEs also have solicited comments regarding the possibility of including additional mortgage insurance in excess of standard coverage amounts through a concept known as “deeper cover mortgage insurance,” which could increase the amount of insurance we write. As a result, it is difficult to predict the impact of any credit risk transfer products and transactions implemented by the GSEs.
In Item 1A. Risk Factors, see “—Changes in the charters, business practices, or role of the GSEs in the U.S. housing market generally, could significantly impact our mortgage insurance business.” and “—Our mortgage insurance business faces intense competition.”
FHA
Private mortgage insurance competes with the single-family mortgage insurance programs of the FHA. As such, the FHA is one of our biggest competitors. We compete with the FHA on the basis of loan limits, pricing, credit guidelines, terms of our insurance policies and loss mitigation practices. Since 2013, the loan limits for FHA-insured loans and the loan limits for GSE conforming loans have been substantially the same. It is possible that, in the future, Congress could impose different loan limits for FHA loans than for GSE conforming loans as it has done in the past, which could impact the competitiveness of private mortgage insurance in relation to FHA programs.
Beginning in 2008, the FHA, which historically had not been a significant competitor, substantially increased its market share of the insured mortgage market. Since then, the private mortgage insurance industry generally had been recapturing market share from the FHA, primarily due to: (i) improvements in the financial strength of private mortgage insurers; (ii) the development of new products and marketing efforts directed at competing with the FHA; (iii) increases in the FHA’s pricing; (iv) the U.S. government’s pursuit of legal remedies against FHA-approved lenders related to loans insured by the FHA; and (v) various policy changes at the FHA, including the general elimination of the premium cancellation provision that exists for borrower-paid private mortgage insurance. In January 2015, the FHA reduced its annual mortgage insurance premium by 50 basis points to approximately 85 basis points for loans entering the origination process on or after January 26, 2015, including

refinancings. The FHA’s upfront mortgage insurance premium was not changed. Reductions in the FHA’s annual premiums or changes to its policies may impact our competitiveness with the FHA.
Given that FHA and GSE reform have significant impacts on each other, as well as on borrower access to credit and the housing market more broadly, policymakers may consider both GSE reform and FHA reform together. It is unclear whether FHA reform legislation will be adopted and, if so, what provisions it might ultimately contain. If legislative changes to the FHA and GSEs are not made contemporaneously, there is a possibility that the relative competitiveness of private mortgage insurance could be disadvantaged.
The Dodd-Frank Act
The Dodd-Frank Act mandates significant rulemaking by several regulatory agencies to implement its provisions. The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB to regulate the offering and provision of consumer financial products and services under federal law, including residential mortgages, and transferred authority to the CFPB to enforce many existing consumer related federal laws, including the Truth in Lending Act (“TILA”) and RESPA. 
Among the most significant provisions for private mortgage insurers under the Dodd-Frank Act are the ability to repay mortgage provisions (“Ability to Repay Rule”), including a related safe harbor set forth in the QM Rule (defined below), the securitization risk retention provisions and the expanded mortgage servicing requirements under TILA and RESPA.
Qualified Mortgage Requirements - Ability to Repay Requirements. The Ability to Repay Rule requires mortgage lenders to make a reasonable and good faith determination that, at the time the loan is consummated, the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay the loan. The Dodd-Frank Act provides that a creditor may presume that a borrower will be able to repay a loan if the loan has certain low-risk characteristics that meet the definition of a qualified mortgage (“QM Rule”). 
In adopting the QM Rule, the CFPB established rigorous underwriting and product feature requirements for the loans to be deemed qualified mortgages. Within those regulations, the CFPB created a special exemption for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for a period ending upon the earlier of the end of conservatorship or January 10, 2021, which allows any loan that meets the GSE underwriting and product guidelines to be a qualified mortgage. In January 2019, the CFPB released a five year review of the Qualified Mortgage and Ability to Repay rule, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. While this report provided observations on the impact of the QM rule on the market based on CFPB research, it did not include any policy recommendations or propose amending the current rules.
The QM Rule requires that points and fees paid at or prior to closing cannot exceed 3% of the total loan amount, with higher points and fees thresholds provided for loan amounts below $100,000. Any mortgage insurance paid by the borrower at the time of loan closing that is not refundable on a pro-rata basis must be applied toward the 3% points and fee calculation. Additionally, any refundable borrower-paid insurance premiums paid at closing in excess of 175 basis points must be included in a lender’s QM 3% points and fees calculation. There are no similar restrictions on the points and fees associated with FHA premiums, and thus FHA has a market advantage for smaller balance loans where the 3% cap is more easily reached.
The Dodd-Frank Act also granted the FHA, VA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture flexibility to establish their own definitions of qualified mortgages for their insurance guaranty programs. Both the FHA and VA have created their own definition of qualified mortgages that differ from both the CFPB’s definition and the current underwriting and product guidelines at the GSEs that are subject to the special exemption. These alternate definitions of qualified mortgages are more favorable to lenders and mortgage holders than the CFPB QM Rule that applies to the GSEs and the markets in which we operate, which could drive business to these agencies and have a negative impact on our mortgage insurance business.
Qualified Residential Mortgage Regulations - Securitization Risk Retention Requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act requires securitizers to retain at least 5% of the credit risk associated with mortgage loans that they transfer, sell or convey, unless the mortgage loans are qualified residential mortgages (“QRMs”) or are insured by the FHA or another federal agency. Under applicable federal regulations, a QRM is generally defined as a mortgage meeting the requirements of a qualified mortgage under the CFPB’s QM Rule described above. Because of the capital support provided by the U.S. government to the GSEs, the GSEs satisfy the proposed risk retention requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act while they are in conservatorship, so sellers of loans to the GSEs currently are not subject to the risk retention requirements referenced above. This means that securitizers would not be required to retain risk under the final QRM rule on loans that are guaranteed by the GSEs while in conservatorship. The final rule requires the agencies that implemented the rule to review the QRM definition no later than four years after its effective date (i.e., December 2018) and every five years thereafter, and allows each agency to request a review of the definition at any time.
Mortgage Servicing Rules. Among its products and services, our Services business provides services to financial institutions that are focused on evaluating compliance with and establishing processes and procedures to implement national

and state servicing standards, including the CFPB’s mortgage servicing regulations. The Dodd-Frank Act amended and expanded upon mortgage servicing requirements under TILA and RESPA. The CFPB amended Regulation Z (promulgated under TILA) and Regulation X (promulgated under RESPA) to conform these regulations to the new statutory requirements. Among other things, the rules include new or enhanced requirements for handling loans that are in default. Complying with the mortgage servicing rules has been challenging and costly for many loan servicers. Since the final rules were adopted in 2014, the CFPB has clarified those rules through subsequent rulemakings and provided guidance on how servicers must apply them in certain circumstances. In October 2017 the CFPB issued an interim final rule that amended provisions of the Regulation X mortgage servicing rules that it had previously issued in 2016. Along with its review of the Qualified Mortgage and Ability to Repay Rule in January of 2019, the CFPB also provided an assessment of the mortgage servicing rules. The CFPB offered observations regarding the impact of the rules on foreclosure avoidance and servicing costs, but again offered no specific proposed action regarding the rules going forward. 
Other. In addition to the foregoing, the Dodd-Frank Act establishes a Federal Insurance Office within the U.S. Treasury (the “FIO”). While the FIO does not have a general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance, the director of this office performs various functions with respect to insurance, such as serving as a non-voting member of the Financial Stability Oversight Council. It is difficult to predict whether legislators or other executive agencies will pursue the development and implementation of federal standards for the mortgage insurance industry. However, to the extent these recommendations are acted upon by legislators or other executive action, a divergence from the current system of state regulation could significantly change compliance burdens and possibly impact our financial condition.
RESPA
Settlement service providers in connection with the origination or refinance of a federally regulated mortgage loan are subject to RESPA and Regulation X. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the authority to implement and enforce RESPA was transferred to the CFPB. RESPA authorizes the CFPB, the U.S. Department of Justice, state attorneys general and state insurance commissioners to bring civil enforcement actions, and also provides for criminal penalties and private rights of action.
Mortgage insurance and other products and services provided by Radian’s affiliates are considered settlement services for purposes of RESPA. The anti-referral fee and anti-kickback provisions of Section 8 of RESPA generally provide, among other things, that settlement service providers are prohibited from paying or accepting anything of value in connection with the referral of a settlement service or sharing in fees for those services. RESPA also prohibits requiring the use of an affiliate for settlement services and requires certain information to be disclosed if an affiliate is used to provide the settlement services. In addition to mortgage insurance, through our Services business we offer a broad array of both settlement and non-settlement services to our customers, including real estate, valuation, appraisal, title and closing services. To the extent products and services provided by our Services business are settlement services for purposes of RESPA, the anti-referral fee, anti-kickback, and required use provisions of RESPA may apply which could impact how these products and services are marketed and sold. 
In the past, we and other mortgage insurers have faced lawsuits alleging, among other things, that our captive reinsurance arrangements constituted unlawful payments to mortgage lenders under RESPA. We also have been subject to lawsuits alleging that our Pool Insurance and contract underwriting services violated RESPA. In addition, we and other mortgage insurers have been subject to inquiries and investigative demands from state and federal governmental agencies, including the CFPB, requesting information relating to captive reinsurance. In April 2013, we reached a settlement with the CFPB that concluded its investigation with respect to Radian Guaranty without any findings of wrongdoing. As part of the settlement, Radian Guaranty paid a civil penalty and agreed that it would not enter into any new captive reinsurance agreement or reinsure any new loans under any existing captive reinsurance agreement for a period of 10 years ending in 2023. In June 2015, Radian Guaranty executed a Consent Order with the Minnesota Department of Commerce that resolved the Minnesota Department of Commerce’s outstanding inquiries related to captive reinsurance arrangements involving mortgage insurance in Minnesota without any findings of wrongdoing. As part of the Consent Order, Radian Guaranty paid a civil penalty and agreed not to enter into new captive reinsurance arrangements until June 2025. We have not entered into any new captive reinsurance arrangements since 2007. In addition, under the PMIERs, the GSEs prohibit private mortgage insurers from entering into captive insurance arrangements. 
The CFPB amended Regulations X and Z to establish significant new disclosure requirements and forms in Regulation Z for most closed-end consumer credit transactions secured by real property through a regulation known as the “TRID rule.” The TRID rule became effective October 3, 2015, and mandates that a series of enhanced disclosures be provided to consumers in connection with the origination of most types of residential mortgage loans. Implementation of the TRID rule resulted in an increased burden on loan originators to comply. In addition, difficulties implementing the new disclosure rules and uncertainty with respect to certain aspects of the TRID rule, including uncertainty as to whether a closed loan fully complies with the TRID

rule requirements, negatively impacted the purchase of loans in the secondary market by private investors. In July 2016, the CFPB issued proposed amendments to the TRID rule to formalize CFPB guidance and provide greater clarity and certainty for market participants, and finalized these amendments in the form of new TRID rules in July of 2017, known as “TRID 2.0.” Mandatory compliance with TRID 2.0 became effective in October 2018. We believe that the guidance that has been provided by the CFPB, together with TRID 2.0, will reduce the uncertainty and remove certain impediments to originating new loans that followed the implementation of the original TRID rule.
Homeowner Assistance Programs
The Emergency Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 (“EESA”) included a requirement to “maximize assistance to homeowners and encourage mortgage servicers to take advantage of available programs (including the Hope for Homeowners program) to minimize foreclosures.” In 2008, the U.S. Treasury announced the Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan to restructure or refinance mortgages to avoid foreclosures through: (i) refinancing mortgage loans through HARP; (ii) modifying first- and second-lien mortgage loans through HAMP and the Second Lien Modification Program; and (iii) offering other alternatives to foreclosure through the Home Affordable Foreclosure Alternatives Program. HAMP expired in December 2016 and was replaced with the “Flex Modification” program that will offer payment relief similar to HAMP. Refinancing under the HARP program expired on December 31, 2018. The GSEs have since established high LTV streamlined refinance programs in coordination with FHFA to continue providing refinancing options to avoid foreclosure. These programs began enrolling participants in November 2018. 
In response to the extensive damage caused by hurricanes during 2017 and 2018, we are supporting the disaster relief policies issued by the GSEs that provide various forms of assistance to accommodate the financial needs of homeowners in the affected areas, including temporary suspension of foreclosures, penalty waivers, and forbearance or modification plans that provide more flexible mortgage payment terms.
The SAFE Act 
The SAFE Act and its state law equivalents require mortgage loan originators to be licensed with state agencies in the states in which they operate and/or registered with the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry (the “Registry”). The Registry is a database established by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors and the American Association of Residential Mortgage Regulators that tracks the licensing and eligibility requirements of loan originators. Among other things, the database was established to support the licensing of mortgage loan originators by each state. As part of this licensing and registration process, loan originators who are employees of institutions other than depository institutions or certain of their subsidiaries that, in each case, are regulated by a federal banking agency, must generally be licensed under the SAFE Act guidelines enacted by each state in which they engage in loan origination activities and registered with the Registry. The entity and its employees that provide our contract underwriting services are compliant with the SAFE Act in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. 
Mortgage Insurance Cancellation
The HPA imposes certain cancellation and termination requirements for borrower-paid private mortgage insurance and requires certain disclosures to borrowers regarding their rights under the law. The HPA also requires certain disclosures for loans covered by lender-paid private mortgage insurance. Specifically, the HPA provides that private mortgage insurance on most loans originated on or after July 29, 1999 may be cancelled at the request of the borrower once the LTV reaches 80% of the original value, provided that certain conditions are satisfied. Under HPA, private mortgage insurance on borrower-paid mortgage insurance must be canceled automatically on the date the LTV is scheduled to reach 78% of the original value (or, if the loan is not current on that date, on the date that the loan becomes current).
The HPA establishes special rules for the termination of private mortgage insurance in connection with loans that are “high risk.” The HPA does not define “high risk” loans, but leaves that determination to the GSEs for loans up to the GSE conforming loan limits and to lenders for any other loan. For “high risk” loans, private mortgage insurance must be terminated on the date that the LTV is first scheduled to reach 77% of the unpaid principal balance. In no case, however, may private mortgage insurance be required beyond the midpoint of the amortization period of the loan if the borrower is current on the payments required by the terms of the mortgage.
The Fair Credit Reporting Act (the “FCRA”)
The FCRA imposes restrictions on the permissible use of credit report information and disclosures that must be made to consumers when information from their credit reports is used. The FCRA has been interpreted by some Federal Trade Commission staff to require mortgage insurance companies to provide “adverse action” notices to consumers in the event an 
 48

application for mortgage insurance is declined or a higher premium is charged based on the use, wholly or partly, of information contained in the consumer’s credit report.
Privacy and Information Security - Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the “GLBA”) and Other Regulatory Requirements
As part of our business, we, and certain of our subsidiaries, maintain large amounts of confidential information, including non-public personal information on consumers and our employees. We and our customers are subject to a variety of privacy and information security laws and regulations. The GLBA imposes privacy requirements on financial institutions, including obligations to protect and safeguard consumers’ nonpublic personal information and records, and limitations on the re-use of such information. The GLBA is enforced by state insurance regulators and by federal regulatory agencies. In addition, many states have enacted privacy and data security laws that impose compliance obligations beyond GLBA, including obligations to provide notification in the event that a security breach results in a reasonable belief that unauthorized persons may have obtained access to consumer nonpublic personal information.
Federal and state agencies have increased their focus on compliance obligations related to privacy, data security and cybersecurity. The CFPB, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and non-governmental regulatory agencies, such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), have announced new compliance measures and enforcement efforts designed to monitor and regulate the protection of personal consumer data, including with respect to: the development and delivery of financial products and services; underwriting; mortgage servicing; credit reporting; digital payment systems; and vendor management. For information regarding the New York Department of Financial Services cybersecurity regulations and the California Consumer Privacy Act see “—State Regulation—Cybersecurity.”
Asset Backed Securitizations
Our Services business provides services to issuers of and investors in asset backed securitizations and similar transactions. As a result, regulations impacting the asset backed securitization market may impact our Services business directly, or indirectly through the regulation of our Services customers.
In August 2014, the SEC adopted final rules under Regulation AB that substantially revised the offering process, disclosure and reporting requirements for offerings of ABS. The Regulation AB II rules implement several key areas of reform. Specifically, Regulation AB II introduces several new requirements related to public offerings of ABS, including the following that are significant for our Services business:

• | Asset-level disclosure requirements for ABS backed by residential mortgage loans, commercial mortgage loans, automobile loans or leases, re-securitizations of ABS backed by any of those asset types, and debt securities; and


• | A requirement that the transaction documents provide for the appointment of an “asset representations manager” to review the pool assets when certain trigger events occur.

In June 2015 the final credit rating agency reform rules issued by the SEC became effective. These rules for nationally recognized statistical ratings organizations (“NRSRO”) include requirements that are applicable to providers of third-party due diligence services (such as our Services business) for both publicly and privately issued Exchange Act ABS. Among other things, the NRSRO rules require that any issuer or underwriter of registered or unregistered ABS that are to be rated by a NRSRO furnish a form filed on the SEC’s EDGAR system that describes the findings and conclusions of any third-party due diligence report obtained by the issuer or underwriter. In addition, the rule requires that a due diligence firm (such as our Services business) that is engaged to perform services in connection with any rated ABS issuance furnish a form that describes the scope of due diligence services performed and a summary of their findings and conclusions; this form is required to be posted on the ABS issuer’s password-protected website.
Mortgage Insurance Tax Deduction
In 2006, Congress enacted the private mortgage insurance tax deduction in order to foster homeownership. The deduction was enacted on a temporary basis and it expired at the end of 2011. Since 2011, the private mortgage insurance tax deduction has been extended four times, most recently for insurance premiums paid through December 31, 2017. It has not yet been extended for the 2018 tax year, and it is unclear if and when it may be extended. There continue to be legislative efforts to make this tax deduction permanent, but to date this has not been enacted. It is difficult to predict whether the deduction will be extended in the future.
Basel III
Over the past few decades, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the “Basel Committee”) has established international benchmarks for assessing banks’ capital adequacy requirements (“Basel III”). Included within those benchmarks 
 49

are capital standards related to residential lending and securitization activity and importantly for private mortgage insurers, the capital treatment of mortgage insurance on those loans. These benchmarks are then interpreted and implemented via rulemaking by U.S. banking regulators. In July 2013, the U.S. banking regulators promulgated regulations, referred to as the “U.S. Basel III Rules,” to implement significant elements of the Basel framework. The U.S. Basel III Rules, among other things, revise and enhance the U.S. banking agencies’ general risk-based capital rules. Today, the U.S. Basel III Rules assign a 20%, 50% or 100% risk weight to loans secured by one-to-four-family residential properties. Generally, under the U.S. Basel III Rules in place today, the explicit government guarantees (FHA/VA/USDA) receive a 0% risk weight, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac related loans receive a 20% risk weight. Non-government related mortgage exposures secured by a first lien on a one-to-four family residential property that are prudently underwritten and that are performing according to their original terms receive a 50% risk weighting. All other one-to-four family residential mortgage loans are assigned a 100% risk weight. 
In December 2014, the Basel Committee issued a proposal for further revisions to Basel III. It proposed adjustments to the risk weights for residential mortgage exposures that take into account LTV ratio and the borrower’s ability to service a mortgage, which were not previously addressed by Basel III. The proposed LTV ratio did not take into consideration any credit enhancement, including private mortgage insurance, but in March 2015, the U.S. banking regulators clarified that for purposes of the U.S. Basel III Rules, calculation of LTV ratios can account for credit enhancement such as private mortgage insurance in determining whether a loan is made in accordance with prudent underwriting standards for purposes of receiving the preferred 50% risk weight. The comment period for this proposal closed in March 2015, and in December 2015, the Basel Committee released a second proposal which retained the LTV provisions of the initial draft, but not the provisions pertaining to a borrower’s ability to service a mortgage (the “2015 Basel Committee Proposal”). The comment period for the 2015 Basel Committee Proposal closed in March 2016. To date, federal regulators have not adopted or implemented any new regulations, including based on these proposals, that update or modify the U.S. Basel III Rules.
The revised and final recommendations from the Basel Committee with respect to Basel III were published in December 2017 (the “2017 Basel Committee III Recommendations”), and finalized risk weighting guidelines for residential mortgage exposures. These rules recognize guarantees provided by sovereign governments (such as FHA, VA, USDA and Ginnie Mae) as off-setting the capital requirements, resulting in a 0% risk weight. While the 2017 Basel Committee III Recommendations include consideration of LTV ratios, including the impact of credit enhancement provided by third-party private mortgage insurance and the GSEs on LTV ratios, the credit enhancement provided by third-party private mortgage insurance and the GSEs would have higher risk weightings than the explicitly government guaranteed products, putting loans insured by private mortgage insurance at a disadvantage. It remains unclear whether new guidelines will be proposed or finalized in the U.S. in response to the most recent 2017 Basel III Committee Recommendations. 
See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—The implementation of the Basel III guidelines may discourage the use of mortgage insurance.”
