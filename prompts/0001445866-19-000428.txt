ITEM 1. Business.
 
Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms "we," "us," "our," "registrant," and "Company" refer to Mount Tam Biotechnologies, Inc., a Nevada corporation and, where applicable, its wholly-owned subsidiary Mount Tam Biotechnologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Mount Tam"), and effective October 2018, its wholly-owned subsidiary Mount Tam Therapuetics, Inc., a Delaware corporation.
 
Overview
 
The Company was established in November 2011 under the name TabacaleraYsidron. On August 13, 2015, the registrant entered into a Share Exchange and Conversion Agreement (the "Exchange Agreement") by and among the registrant and a holder of a majority of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the registrant (the "Majority Shareholder"), on the one hand, and Mount Tam, the stockholders of Mount Tam ("Mount Tam Stockholders"), and the holders of certain convertible promissory notes of Mount Tam ("Mount Tam Noteholders"). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity securities of Mount Tam and the Mount Tam Stockholders and the Mount Tam Noteholders become the controlling stockholders of the registrant. The transactions contemplated by the Exchange Agreement are hereinafter referred to as the "Share Exchange." Prior to the Share Exchange, the registrant was a "shell company" (as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act), however, after the Share Exchange the registrant is no longer a shell company.
 
Effective on August 31, 2015, the registrant changed its name from TabacaleraYsidron, Inc. to Mount TAM Biotechnologies, Inc.  The name change was effected through a parent/subsidiary short-form merger of Mount TAM Biotechnologies, Inc., our wholly-owned Nevada subsidiary which we formed solely for the purpose of the name change, with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving corporation.  With the exception of the name change, there were no changes to the Company's Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws. There will be no mandatory exchange of stock certificates.
 
We are an emerging biopharmaceutical company established to optimize, develop and bring to market a portfolio of products focused on improving the health and wellbeing of individuals afflicted with serious diseases, with a lead product targeting systemic lupus erythematosus ("SLE") and a strategy to bring to market novel therapeutics across a range of serious disease areas.
 
On August 17, 2014, Mount Tam entered into a Research Collaboration and License Agreement (the "Buck Institute License Agreement") with The Buck Institute for Research on Aging, an independent non-profit research organization devoted to aging and the diseases of aging based in Northern California ("Buck Institute"), pursuant to which Mount Tam secured a worldwide exclusive license to certain compounds and technology to develop, manufacture and commercialize these compounds in the field of autoimmune diseases.  Our most advanced product candidate is TAM-01, a preclinical stage compound, which represents what we believe to be a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of SLE.  In July 2016 an amendment was signed which broadened the license to include any and all conditions, human and veterinary.  In February 2017 we announced that we were advancing into Discovery TAM-03, a novel rapamycin analog ("rapalog") which we consider to be a potential candidate for addressing an unmet need in several important cancer types. In July 2017 we announced that we had entered into collaboration with a prominent academic laboratory in the field of neurodegeneration to explore the potential of our compounds in Parkinson’s Disease.
 On October 18, 2018, the “Company” and Mount Tam Biotechnologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation, its wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary (“Mount Tam Delaware”), entered into a stock purchase agreement (the “SPA”) with ARJ Consulting, LLC, a New York limited liability company (the “Buyer”), pursuant to which the Company sold 100% of the capital stock in and of Mount Tam Delaware to the Buyer (the “Sale Transaction”). Prior to the Sale Transaction, the Company caused Mount Tam to transfer certain assets, including the Buck Institute License Agreement, that Mount Tam Delaware was holding to another wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, Mount Tam Therapeutics, Inc., a newly formed (October 2018) Delaware corporation. At the time of the Sale Transaction Mount Tam possessed certain Net Operating Losses and tax credits. Pursuant to the terms of the SPA, the Buyer purchased Mount Tam for a purchase price of $410,000.

All company operations are based in the United States. As of the date of this report, we had no products that have obtained marketing approval in any jurisdiction. Additionally, we have not generated revenues since inception and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future due to the early stage nature of our current product candidate.
 
Background on the Potential SLE Market
 
As of the date of this Report, we were focusing the development of our lead product candidate in the field of SLE, an autoimmune disorder where current treatments are often not adequate to fully control disease and a condition where a serious unmet need remains.
 
According to the Lupus Foundation of America, 1.5 million Americans have some form of lupus although some other estimates are more conservative. The exact etiology of lupus is unknown. As an autoimmune disease, the immune system is unable to properly differentiate between healthy tissues and foreign invaders, leading the immune system to attack healthy tissues. This may cause inflammation of the joints, heart, lungs, kidneys, brain and blood vessels. Lupus is a disease that goes through stages of remission and flares.
 
SLE is the most serious form of lupus. It is a chronic, inflammatory disorder that can damage many parts of the body, including the skin, joints and internal organs. Lupus nephritis ("LN") is a common and very serious complication for people with SLE, causing inflammation of the kidneys that may lead to significant illness and even death.
 
There is currently no known cure for SLE and no treatment that fully stabilizes the disease. Patients diagnosed with lupus are treated with a range of therapies including anti-malarials, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and newer biologic agents that primarily address the symptoms of the disease.  Despite the range of available therapies, the burden of disease for SLE patients remains high, with significant morbidity and mortality seen in this population even with best currently available care.  SLE also brings a strong economic impact to patients and to society at large, both in direct and indirect economic impacts due to increased medical costs, lost wages for patients and for caregivers.
 
Our Product Candidates:
 TAM-01
Our lead product candidate, TAM-01, is a novel rapalog which exerts its action through direct binding and inhibition of the mammalian Target of Rapamycin ("mTOR"). mTOR is a key regulatory pathway which is altered in individuals suffering from a range of disorders including autoimmune diseases such as lupus. Based on extensive research over the last several decades we now understand that mTOR inhibitors, particularly rapamycin, may reduce disease activity and normalize T cell activation-induced calcium fluxing in SLE patients, and may also normalize immune function through suppression of autoreactive B cells.
 
The only rapalogs currently approved by FDA are rapamycin (sirolimus) and its first generation analogs (temsirolimus, everolimus), but none of these are approved for use in SLE patients. Unfortunately their potential utility as therapeutic agents for the treatment of many chronic diseases such as SLE is limited due to their significant side effects, including impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, and lipid dysregulation. Our lead product candidate, TAM-01 is a novel and proprietary rapalog, which has been shown in extensive preclinical pharmacology studies to deliver the high therapeutic efficacy of rapamycin while significantly reducing or abolishing some of its side effects.
 
Discovery, lead optimization and pre-development activities (including preliminary scale up) have been largely completed for TAM-01 and it is ready for initiation of cGMP manufacturing to be followed by IND-enabling safety studies (“GLP Tox studies”). A number of pharmacological studies in validated disease models (such as the NZBW/F1J SLE mouse model) have demonstrated that TAM-01 exhibits dose-dependent efficacy similar to rapamycin or temsirolimus. At 14-week dosage, TAM-01 is shown to reduce disease progression as measured by proteinuria, renal IgG and IgM deposition, anti-dsDNA antibody titers and ANA antibody titers. Examination of the kidney pathology of the NZBW/F1J mice showed that TAM-01 ameliorated kidney disease and reduced renal IgG and IgM deposits similarly to temsirolimus. Additionally, other studies have shown that, in contrast to both rapamycin and temsirolimus, TAM-01 has minimal impact on glucose levels, glucose tolerance, did not induce hyperlipidemia (cholesterol and triglyceride elevations), and had minimal impact on reticulocyte counts.

Although rapamycin and other rapalogs are thought to act primarily through the inhibition of the protein complex mTOR Complex 1 ("TORC1"), it is now well established that these drugs also have inhibitory effects on mTOR Complex 2 ("TORC2").   Our studies have shown TAM-01 to be a more selective TORC1 inhibitor vs. rapamycin and its analogs (having greater TORC1 inhibitory activity relative to TORC2 inhibitory activity) and we believe that this greater selectivity is the reason TAM-01 has shown a superior adverse event profile in mice vs. other rapalogs while still maintaining a strong efficacy profile.  This theory, however, has not been proven in clinical trials and the superior adverse event profile seen in mice may not be demonstrated in clinical trials in humans.
 
TAM-01 exhibits superior oral bioavailability vs. rapamycin, which is expected to result in reduced variability of absorption and superior pharmacokinetics, making it suitable for administration via a flexible dosing regimen. TAM-01 has completed preliminary non-GLP 14-day toxicology, safety, PK, ADME, preliminary scale up manufacturing studies, and analytic and purification methods have been established.  We are ready to initiate cGMP manufacturing and GLP studies in order to prepare and submit an Investigational New Drug ("IND") to FDA. We intend to advance TAM-01 to phase 1 clinical development in the United States within 18-24 months from the time we have completed our fundraising targets and recruitment of all required personnel. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will be able to begin phase 1 clinical development in this time frame, if at all.
 
Rapalogs have been used in cancer therapy for some time to treat a range of cancers.  Novartis' Affinitor/Votubia (everolimus), the leading rapalog for treating cancer, was first approved in 2009 to treat advanced kidney cancer and is now approved to treat a range of other cancers including certain breast and pancreatic cancers as well as tuberous sclerosis complex.  Novartis reported sales of Afinitor/Votubia in 2018 were approx. $1.6 billion. 
 
Real unmet need remains in these cancers however, with median progression free survival (PFS) in clinical trials with Afinitor reported to be less than 1 year in several important cancer types.  An improved therapy that could meaningfully increase PFS, or as/more importantly, overall survival (OS), that still provided acceptable tolerability would likely be welcome by both healthcare providers and patients and we believe that by altering the mTORC1:2 inhibitory profile and other important pharmaceutical characteristics, e.g. potency and PK profiles we have the potential to accomplish this.
 
Given the unmet need and the unique characteristics of TAM-01, we are in the process of undertaking the first steps to characterize the cancer killing potential of TAM-01 through in vitro and in vivo experimentation. 
 
However, preclinical and clinical development of cancer therapeutics is particularly challenging and we are at an early stage in the characterization of TAM-01 as a potential cancer therapeutic with many challenges, both known and unknown, lying ahead and so probability of product approval and commercialization must be considered low until more data are generated to support TAM-01s potential as a clinical development candidate.
 Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a devastating disease affecting around one million individuals in the US, impacting quality of life for both patients and caregivers and costing the US economy approx. $20B annually. Dysfunction in the process of autophagy (the natural process for ‘cellular cleanup’ where protein debris is ‘recycled’) is a key component in the development of Parkinson's disease, with PD patients showing altered autophagy and increased mTOR activity.
 As it is well known that mTORC1 inhibitors can increase the rate of autophagy, the potential for rapalogs to address unmet need in Parkinson’s Disease (PD) has been explored in multiple preclinical models and rapamycin has shown promise in this area. Given TAM-01’s pharmacologic profile and potential to deliver a unique combination of efficacy and tolerability vs. current rapalogs, Mount Tam has entered into preclinical studies to explore its compounds potential in this area, including TAM-01. These are early investigations into this historically challenging area for clinical development, with Mount Tam’s goal being to quickly determine the potential of our compounds in this area and to determine our future pathway in PD.
 
TAM-03
 
TAM-03 is a novel rapalog with a differentiated selectivity profile of TORC1 vs. TORC2 inhibition (as compared to rapamycin, to on-market rapalogs temsirolimus and everolimus, and to TAM-01), and also, favorable potency and bioavailability profiles. We believe that this overall profile makes it an appropriate candidate for further discovery work as a cancer therapy target, and potentially other indications.   As with TAM-01, we are in the process of 

3

undertaking the first steps to characterize the cancer killing potential of TAM-03 through both in vitro and in vivo 
 experimentation. We are also exploring TAM-03’s potential in Parkinson’s Disease through exploratory in vivo models as part of an ongoing collaboration with an academic laboratory with significant experience in studying neurodegenerative diseases. Initial results for TAM-03 in several in vivo Parkinson’s Disease studies are very encouraging showing impressive efficacy at multiple dose levels and suggesting that TAM-03 has the potential to become an important clinical candidate to treat this devastating disease. 
 
Our Suppliers and Manufacturers
 
We do not own or operate, and as of the date of this Report had no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We will rely on third-party contract manufacturers ("CMOs") for the manufacture of our product candidates for larger scale preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial quantities of any product candidates that are approved.
 
We do not have any current contractual relationships for the manufacture of commercial supplies of our product candidates if they are approved, and we intend to enter into agreements with a third-party contract manufacturer and one or more back-up manufacturers for the commercial production of our product candidates as they near potential approval.
 
Any drug products to be used in clinical trials and any approved product that we may commercialize will need to be manufactured in facilities, and by processes, that comply with FDA's current good manufacturing practice ("cGMP") requirements and comparable requirements of the regulatory agencies of other jurisdictions in which we are seeking approval.
 
Competition
 
We are a development company with no products on the market as of the date of this Report. We face competition from other companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations for collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific and management personnel and for licenses to additional technologies. Many of our competitors will have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we have. Our success depends in part on our ability to build, obtain regulatory approval for and market acceptance of, and actively manage a portfolio of drugs that addresses serious unmet medical needs.
 
If approved, our lead compound TAM-01 would compete with currently marketed drugs and therapies used for treatment of SLE and potentially with drug candidates currently in preclinical or clinical development. Patients diagnosed with SLE are currently treated with a range of therapies with varied success. Our main competitor is a biologic product, Benlysta(R), the only FDA approved drug specifically for SLE patients. Benlysta targets and blocks B Lymphocyte Stimulator, which promotes autoimmunity by permitting autoimmune B cells to live longer. However, Benlysta has not been evaluated in patients with severe active lupus nephritis or severe active central nervous system lupus and is not recommended for these patients.  TAM-01 intends to take advantage of these limitations and to provide an effective therapy for these patients.  Clinical success, however, is uncertain and our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Oncology clinical development is very competitive with one recently published study stating that there were more than 1,500 clinical trials underway in the oncology space during the study period, far more than any other therapeutic area. In this environment any newly approved oncology product must show significant benefit over standard of care at time of approval, a significant barrier to entry.
 
Neurodegenerative diseases bring tremendous economic impact to society and burden of disease to patients and their families. There is a very high level of unmet need in this area and with the importance of these diseases to societies many large pharmaceutical manufacturers and biotechs are actively developing therapeutics to target these diseases. This creates a competitive environment and for our compounds to be successful will require us to show benefit vs. current and future therapeutics and will require us to compete against companies with access to much greater resources and expertise.
 
Intellectual Properties and Licenses

4


We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business and seek to obtain and maintain patents for any patentable aspects of our products and any other inventions that are important to the development of our business. Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain our patent portfolio and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, to defend and enforce our patents, to maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties, to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and to operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in our targeted therapeutic. 
 
On August 17, 2014, Mount Tam entered into the Buck Institute License Agreement. This agreement establishes a joint research effort led by Buck Institute to identify and develop compounds from two specific chemical chemotypes identified therein. We provide certain funding for Buck Institute's research efforts performed under the Buck Institute License Agreement. Under the terms of the Buck Institute License Agreement, Buck Institute assigned exclusive, worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize pharmaceutical products that incorporate a compound from one of two chemical compounds, identified therein, and exclusive rights to practice the drug discovery platform technology as necessary to research, develop and commercialize such pharmaceutical products. Mount Tam retains rights to inventions made by its employees, and Buck Institute will assign to Mount Tam all inventions made under the Buck Institute License Agreement jointly by its employees and Buck Institute personnel, provided that Mount Tam has complied with its funding obligations set forth in the Buck Institute License Agreement. On March 19, 2015 Mount Tam entered into an amendment to the Buck Institute License Agreement to extend the deadline of funding milestones and its reimbursement obligations for expenses that Buck Institute accrued relating to the patents under the Buck Institute License Agreement. On April 1, 2015, Mount Tam satisfied this revised funding milestone deadline with Buck Institute.
 
During the second quarter of 2016 the Company entered into negotiations with the Buck Institute to resolve certain outstanding financial concerns, and to broaden the Research Collaboration and License Agreement beyond the area of autoimmune disease. On July 18, 2016, the Company entered into an amendment (the "Amendment") to the Research Collaboration and License Agreement (the "License Agreement") between the Company and The Buck Institute.
 
By way of background, and as previously disclosed in the Company's public filings, the Company previously entered into a Research Collaboration and License Agreement (the "Buck Institute License Agreement") with the Buck Institute, which establishes a joint research effort led by Buck Institute to identify and develop compounds from two specific chemical chemotypes identified therein. The Company agreed to provide certain funding for Buck Institute's research efforts performed under the Buck Institute License Agreement. Under the terms of the Buck Institute License Agreement, Buck Institute assigned exclusive, worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize pharmaceutical products that incorporate a compound from one of two chemical compounds, identified therein, and exclusive rights to practice the drug discovery platform technology as necessary to research, develop and commercialize such pharmaceutical products. (Additional information about the Buck Institute License Agreement, together with prior amendments thereto, may be found in the Company's public filings).
 
Pursuant to this Amendment, the Research Collaboration Term of the License Agreement is tolled until the Company can achieve a Qualified Financing (defined as any financing occurring after the date of the Amendment which results in gross proceeds to the Company of at least $2,000,000). Once a Qualified Financing has been achieved, the research collaboration efforts will resume, and will continue for a period of twenty-one months (the "Extended Research Collaboration Term"). The Company and The Buck Institute agreed to work together to determine a new research plan, specifying the research and development activities of both parties during the Extended Research Collaboration Term.
 
Moreover, in the Amendment the parties agreed that the field of use covered by the License Agreement would be expanded, with the new definition being "the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of any and all conditions or diseases including, without limitation, systemic lupus erythematous and multiple sclerosis for human and/or veterinary use." (Under the original License Agreement, the Company's field of use had been restricted to autoimmune disorders.)

Within the licensed library is TAM-01. TAM-01's composition of matter is patented in the US, having an expiration date of December 2032. TAM-01's composition of matter patent has been allowed in Japan, expected to provide coverage through 2032 or beyond. Our licensed TAM-01 European (EU) patent claiming TAM-01 as well as compositions, uses, and processes for preparing TAM01, was granted in February 2018 and validated in 18 EU nations in the second quarter of 2018. We continue, as part of our ongoing research and development efforts, to strive to defend and to strengthen the intellectual property position of our key assets.
 As consideration for the assignments and licenses, we issued Buck Institute 1,200,000 (post-merger) (450,000 pre-merger) shares of our common stock and Mount Tam is obligated to pay to Buck Institute milestone payments on development of its proprietary products claimed by patents assigned or licensed to it by Buck Institute. Mount Tam also is obligated to pay low single digit royalties, including annual minimum royalties, on sales of such products. Should Mount Tam grant licenses or sublicenses to those patents to third parties, Mount Tam is obligated to share a percentage or resulting revenue with Buck Institute. Mount Tam's royalty payment obligations are reduced if currently pending patent applications become invalid or if Mount Tam has to pay third parties to obtain certain licenses for the company to manufacture, use, sell or import its products produced pursuant to the Buck Institute License Agreement. Payment obligations terminate on expiration or annulment of the last patent covered by the Buck Institute License Agreement.
 
The Buck Institute License Agreement will terminate upon the expiration of our payment obligations thereunder. Mount Tam can terminate the licenses to any or all licensed patents upon specified advance notice to Buck Institute. Buck Institute may terminate the license provisions of the agreement only for cause. Termination of the Buck Institute License Agreement does not terminate Mount Tam's rights in patents assigned to it.
 
In addition to our TAM-01 license, Mount Tam continues to work diligently to expand its intellectual property portfolio.  As part of these efforts, an international (PCT) patent application directed to TAM-03, as well as compositions, uses and processes for preparing TAM-03, and claiming a February 2017 priority date, was filed in February 2018 (published in August 2018).
 
Governmental Regulations
 
To date, we have conducted and will continue to conduct our preclinical research through contract research organizations ("CROs"), through our partnership with the Buck Institute and through other academic collaborations. We do not at this time have the ability to independently conduct clinical trials for our product candidates, and we expect to continue to rely on CROs, medical institutions and academic collaborators to perform this function for both preclinical and clinical activities. Our reliance on these third parties for pre-clinic and clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities. Although we have, in the ordinary course of business, entered into agreements with these third parties, we continue to be responsible for confirming that all of our preclinical and clinical trials are conducted in accordance with approved investigational plans and protocols. Moreover, FDA requires us to comply with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices or cGCPs, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the trial participants are adequately protected. Our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. To date, we believe that our CROs, the Buck Institute and academic collaborators have performed well.
 
The process of complying with FDA guidelines and obtaining approvals from FDA of applications to market drugs and products is costly, time consuming and subject to unanticipated delays. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain FDA approval for any of our products.
 
Discovery and Development Activities
 
To gain regulatory approval of our products, we must demonstrate, through experiments, preclinical studies and clinical trials that our drug product candidate meets the safety and efficacy standards established by FDA and other international regulatory authorities. In addition, we must demonstrate that all development-related laboratory, clinical and manufacturing practices comply with regulations of FDA, other international regulators and where applicable, local regulators.

6

Regulations establish standards for various actions including: drug substances and materials; drug manufacturing operations and facilities; and analytical laboratories and medical development laboratory processes and environments. In each instance, these standards are in connection with research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, and distribution of product candidates, on a product-by-product basis.
 
Preclinical Studies and Clinical Trials
 
Development testing generally begins with laboratory testing and experiments, as well as research studies using animal models to obtain preliminary information on a product's efficacy and to identify potential safety issues. The results of these studies are compiled along with other information in an IND application, which is filed with FDA. After resolving any questions raised by FDA, which may involve additional testing and animal studies, clinical trials may begin. Regulatory agencies in other countries generally require a Clinical Trial Application to be submitted and approved before each trial can commence in each country.
 
Clinical trials normally are conducted in three sequential phases and may take many years to complete. Phase 1 consists of testing the drug product in a small number of humans, often healthy volunteers, to determine preliminary safety and a tolerable dose range. Phase 2 usually involves studies in a limited patient population to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug product in humans having the disease or medical condition for which the product is indicated, determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and identify possible common adverse effects and safety risks. Phase 3 consists of additional controlled testing at multiple clinical sites to establish clinical safety and effectiveness in an expanded patient population of geographically dispersed test sites to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship for administering the product and to provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Phase 4 clinical trials may be conducted after approval to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication.
 
The conduct of clinical trials is subject to stringent medical and regulatory requirements. The time and expense required to establish clinical sites, provide training and materials, establish communications channels and monitor a trial over a long period of time is substantial. The conduct of clinical trials at institutions located around the world is subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials, which vary widely from country to country. Delays or terminations of clinical trials could result from a number of factors, including stringent enrollment criteria, slow rate of enrollment, size of patient population, having to compete with other clinical trials for eligible patients, geographical considerations and others. Clinical trials are monitored by the regulatory agencies as well as medical advisory and standards boards, which could determine at any time to reevaluate, alter, suspend, or terminate a trial based upon accumulated data, including data concerning the occurrence of adverse health events during or related to the treatment of patients enrolled in the trial, and the regulator's or monitor's risk/benefit assessment with respect to patients enrolled in the trial. If they occur, such delays or suspensions could have a material impact on our development programs.
 
Regulatory Review
 
The results of preclinical and clinical trials are submitted to FDA in a New Drug Application ("NDA"), with comparable filings submitted to other international regulators. After the initial submission, FDA has a period of time in which it must determine if the NDA is complete. After an NDA is submitted, although the statutory period provided for FDA's review is less than one year, dealing with questions or concerns of the agency and, taking into account the statutory timelines governing such communications, may result in review periods that can take several years. If an NDA is accepted for filing, following FDA's review, FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional information, or deny the application if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval. If FDA grants approval, the approval may be conditioned upon the conduct of post-marketing clinical trials or other studies to confirm the product's safety and efficacy for its intended use. Until FDA has issued its approval, no marketing activities can be conducted in the United States. Similar regulations apply in other countries. There can be no assurance that any of the Company's drug candidates will receive FDA approval or the approval of regulators in other countries.
Fast Track and Breakthrough Designations
 
FDA has various programs, including fast track and breakthrough therapy designations, which are intended 

7

to expedite the process for reviewing drugs. Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification. Generally, drugs that are eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs, and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments.
 
Fast track designation is intended to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need. Designation may be granted on the basis of preclinical data. A sponsor of a drug that receives fast track designation will typically have more frequent interactions with FDA during drug development. In addition, products that have been designated as fast track can obtain rolling review.
 
Breakthrough therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions. The criteria for breakthrough therapy designation require preliminary clinical evidence that demonstrates the drug may have substantial improvement on at least one clinically significant endpoint over available therapy. A breakthrough therapy designation conveys all of the fast track program features, more intensive FDA guidance on an efficient drug development program, an organizational commitment involving senior managers, and eligibility for rolling review and priority review.
 
A key difference between fast track designation and breakthrough designation is what needs to be demonstrated to qualify for the programs. A breakthrough therapy designation is for a drug that treats a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement on a clinically significant endpoint(s) over available therapies. In contrast, a fast track designation is for a drug that treats a serious or life-threatening condition, and nonclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the serious condition.
 
Where appropriate, the Company intends to seek fast track designation for TAM-01 and TAM-03. There can be no assurance that FDA will grant fast track designation. Even if such designation is provided, it may not result in a faster development or review time. Moreover, fast track designations do not increase the odds of approval. A fast track designation may be rescinded at any time if the drug candidate does not continue to meet the qualifications for these programs.
 
Manufacturing Standards
 
FDA and other international regulators establish standards and routinely inspect facilities and equipment, analytical and quality laboratories and processes used in the manufacturing and monitoring of products. Prior to granting approval of a drug product, FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities, and the facilities of suppliers, to determine that the drug product is manufactured in accordance with cGMP and product specifications. Following approval, FDA will conduct periodic inspections. If, in connection with a facility inspection, FDA determines that a manufacturer does not comply with cGMP regulations and product specifications, FDA will issue an inspection report citing the potential violations and may seek a range of remedies, from administrative sanctions, including the suspension of our manufacturing operations, to seeking civil or criminal penalties.
International Approvals
 
Even if we were to succeed in gaining regulatory approval to market our products in the United States, we will still need to apply for approval with other international regulators if we want to sell outside the United States. Regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar in approach to that of the United States. With certain exceptions, although the approval of FDA carries considerable weight, international regulators are not bound by the findings of FDA and there is a risk that foreign regulators will not accept a clinical trial design or may require additional data or other information not requested by FDA.
Post-approval Regulations
 
Following the grant of marketing approval, FDA regulates the marketing and promotion of drug products. Promotional claims are generally limited to the information provided in the product package insert for each drug product, which is negotiated with FDA during the NDA review process. In addition, FDA enforces regulations designed to guard against conflicts of interest, misleading advertising and improper compensation of prescribing physicians. FDA will review, among other things, direct-to-consumer advertising, prescriber-directed advertising and 

8

promotional materials, sales representative communications to healthcare professionals, promotional programming and promotional activities on the Internet. FDA will also monitor scientific and educational activities. If FDA determines that a company has promoted a product for an unapproved use ("off-label"), or engaged in other violations, it may issue a regulatory letter and may require corrective advertising or other corrective communications to healthcare professionals. Enforcement actions may also potentially include product seizures, injunctions and civil or criminal penalties. The consequences of such an action and the related adverse publicity could have a material adverse effect on a developer's ability to market its drug and its business as a whole.
 
Following approval, FDA and other international regulators will continue to monitor data to assess the safety and efficacy of an approved drug. A post-approval discovery of previously unknown problems or failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or a recall or withdrawal of the product from the market, as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Similar oversight is provided by regulators in jurisdictions outside the US.
 
None of our products under development has been approved for marketing in the United States or elsewhere. We may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for any of our products under development. If we do not obtain the requisite governmental approvals or if we fail to obtain approvals of the scope we request, we or our licensees or strategic alliance or marketing partners may be delayed or precluded entirely from marketing our products, or the commercial use of our products may be limited. Such events would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations
 
If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our current or future product candidates, we may also be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:

the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; 
 ·
federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent; 
 ·
federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 
 ·
the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members; 
 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; and
 ·
state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry's

voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
  If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental laws and regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and impact our financial results.
 
Employees
 
As of the date of this Report, we have two employees. In addition, we use advisors and consultants for research and development, clinical, regulatory, legal and administrative activities. We plan to hire additional staff as we expand research, production, business development, and sales and marketing programs. None of our employees are represented by a labor union.
Research and Development
 
We estimate that we have spent $1,145,623 on research and development activities during the last two fiscal years.
 
Compliance with Environmental Laws
 
Our operations may require the use of hazardous materials (including biological materials) which subject us to a variety of federal, provincial and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. Some of the regulations under the current regulatory structure provide for strict liability, holding a party potentially liable without regard to fault or negligence. We could be held liable for damages and fines as a result of our, or others', business operations should contamination of the environment or individual exposure to hazardous substances occur. We cannot predict how changes in laws or development of new regulations will affect our business operations or the cost of compliance.
