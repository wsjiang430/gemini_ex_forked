Item 1. Business.
General 
The Gap, Inc. (Gap Inc., the "Company," "we," and "our") is a collection of purpose-led, lifestyle brands offering apparel, accessories, and personal care products for women, men, and children under the Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, and Athleta brands.
Gap Inc. is an omni-channel retailer, with sales to customers both in stores and online, through Company-operated and franchise stores, Company-owned websites, and third-party arrangements. As of January 28, 2023, we had Company-operated stores in the United States, Canada, Japan, China, and Taiwan. In fiscal 2022, we signed agreements with a third party, Baozun Inc. ("Baozun"), to operate Gap China and Gap Taiwan ("Gap Greater China") stores and the in-market website as a franchise partner. On January 31, 2023, the Gap China transaction closed with Baozun. The Gap Taiwan operations will continue to operate as usual until regulatory approvals and closing conditions are met.
We have franchise agreements to operate Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, and Athleta throughout Asia, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores and websites that sell apparel and related products under our brand names.
In addition to operating in the specialty, outlet, online, and franchise channels, we use our omni-channel capabilities to bridge the digital world and physical stores to further enhance the shopping experience for our customers. Our omni-channel services, including curbside pick-up, buy online pick-up in store, order-in-store, find-in-store, and ship-from-store, as well as enhanced mobile-enabled experiences, are tailored uniquely across our collection of brands.
Old Navy.  Old Navy is an American value apparel brand that makes current essentials accessible to everyone. The brand celebrates the democracy of style through on-trend, playfully optimistic, affordable, high-quality product, and inclusive size ranges. Old Navy is committed to creating incredible shopping experiences regardless of where, when, and how customers choose to shop, including a fun store experience, a dynamic online channel, and convenient omni-channel capabilities. Old Navy opened its first store in 1994 in the United States and since then has expanded to more than 1,200 Company-operated stores, as well as franchise stores around the world. 
Gap.  Gap is an authority on modern American style. Founded in San Francisco in 1969, Gap continues to build on its heritage grounded in denim and khakis. Gap is a lifestyle brand that includes adult apparel and accessories, Gap Teen, Gap Kids, babyGap, Gap Maternity, Gap Body, GapFit, and Gap Home collections. In 2022, Gap Home, our licensing partnership with Walmart, continued to scale and offer new categories in the home space including launching a collection for kids. Gap connects with customers online, in Company-operated and franchise retail locations globally, and through licensing partnerships. Gap also serves value-conscious customers with exclusively designed collections for Gap Outlet and Gap Factory Stores. 
Banana Republic.  Acquired in 1983 as a travel and adventure outfitter, Banana Republic is a global apparel and accessories brand committed to work for a better republic. Designed for people with purpose who share a passion for life, Banana Republic is redefining luxury by using the finest materials with the latest fabric innovations to create timeless, modern, and versatile clothing, eyewear, jewelry, shoes, handbags, and fragrances. Customers can purchase Banana Republic products globally in the brand's specialty stores, factory stores, online, and franchise stores.
Athleta.  Athleta is a premium fitness and lifestyle brand creating beautiful, technical, sustainable apparel to inspire a community of active, confident women and girls. Established in 1998 and acquired by Gap Inc. in 2008, Athleta integrates technical features and innovative design across its women's collection to carry her through a life in motion, from yoga, training and sports, to everyday activities and travel. In 2022, Athleta unveiled new product collaborations with athletes and celebrities. Additionally, Athleta continued to open new stores in both the U.S. and Canadian markets.
Since 2018, Athleta has been certified as a benefit corporation ("B Corp"), furthering its commitment to using the business as a force for good to drive social and environmental impact. The Company continues to meet rigorous standards across social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency. With this accreditation, Gap Inc. is one of the largest publicly-traded retail companies with a B Corp certified subsidiary apparel brand. 
We ended fiscal 2022 with 2,685 Company-operated stores and 667 franchise store locations. For more information on the number of stores by brand and region, see the table included in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this Form 10-K.
Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, and Athleta each have a private label credit card program and a co-branded credit card program through which customers receive benefits. Private label and co-branded credit cards are provided by a third-party financing company, with associated revenue sharing arrangements reflected in Gap Inc. operations. During fiscal 2022, the Company launched a new long-term credit card program with Barclays that replaced our prior credit card program with Synchrony Financial. We also have an integrated loyalty program across the U.S. and Puerto Rico that aims to attract new customers and create enduring relationships by turning customers into lifelong loyalists. We are focused on increasing the lifetime value of our loyalty members through greater personalization, including by leveraging first party data and increasing promotions with targeted content, offers, and experiences. Although each brand expression has a different look and feel, customers can earn and redeem rewards across all of our purpose-led brands. All of our brands issue and redeem gift cards. 
Product Development
We design, develop, market, and sell a wide range of apparel, footwear and accessories products reflecting a mix of basics and fashion items based on widely accepted fashion trends, striving to bring product to market quickly and provide unrivaled value to customers. We are committed to pursuing technology and product innovation that supports our sustainability efforts while also delivering great quality products to our customers. Our product teams research, test, and iterate each season to deliver the latest styles in fabrics and silhouettes that are made to last while remaining conscious of the types of materials being sourced and the suppliers they work with. We leverage feedback and purchasing data from our customer database, along with market trend insights, to guide our product and merchandising decision-making. 
Marketing and Advertising
We use a variety of marketing and advertising mediums to drive brand health, customer acquisition, and engagement. We leverage our growing customer database and respond to shopping behaviors and needs with personalized content across email, site, and digital media to drive relevance and urgency. Our diversified media mix spans traditional to digital to social media. We focus on productivity of demand generation investments to drive increased effectiveness.
Merchandise Vendors
We purchase private label and non-private label merchandise from over 250 vendors. Our vendors have factories in about 25 countries. Our two largest vendors accounted for approximately 8 percent and 6 percent of the dollar amount of our total fiscal 2022 purchases. Of our merchandise purchased during fiscal 2022, substantially all purchases, by dollar value, were from factories outside the United States. Approximately 30 percent of our fiscal 2022 purchases, by dollar value, were from factories in Vietnam. Approximately 17 percent of our fiscal 2022 purchases, by dollar value, were from factories in Indonesia. Product cost increases or events causing disruption of imports from Vietnam, Indonesia, or other foreign countries, including the imposition of additional import restrictions or taxes, vendors temporarily closing or potentially failing due to political, financial, or regulatory issues, public health crises such as the coronavirus disease ("COVID-19") pandemic, or supply chain disruptions, could have an adverse effect on our operations. Substantially all of our foreign purchases of merchandise are negotiated and paid for in U.S. dollars. For additional information on risks related to our merchandise vendors, see the below sections in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K.
•"Risks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions—The COVID-19 pandemic has and could continue to adversely affect our business and results of operations," 
•“Risks Related to Human Capital, Inventory and Supply Chain Management—Our business is subject to risks associated with global sourcing and manufacturing," 
•"Risks Related to Human Capital, Inventory and Supply Chain Management—Risks associated with importing merchandise from foreign countries, including failure of our vendors to adhere to our Code of Vendor Conduct, could harm our business,” 
•"Risks Related to Operating a Global Business—Our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, negative global climate patterns, or other catastrophic events" and 
•“Risks Related to Operating a Global Business—Trade matters may disrupt our supply chain”
Seasonal Business
Our business typically follows a seasonal pattern, with sales peaking during the end-of-year holiday period. Additionally, other macroeconomic conditions such as the uncertainty surrounding global inflationary pressures, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Russia-Ukraine crisis have had and may continue to have an impact on customer behavior that could result in temporary changes in the seasonality of our business. 
Brand Building
Our ability to develop and evolve our existing brands is a key to our success. We believe our distinct brands are among our most important assets. Virtually all aspects of brand development, from product design and distribution to marketing, merchandising and shopping environments, are controlled by Gap Inc. employees. We continue to invest in our business and enhance the customer experience through ongoing supply chain, digital, marketing, and omni-channel initiatives.
Trademarks and Service Marks
We own the material trademarks used in connection with the marketing, distribution and sale of our products, domestically and internationally, where our products are currently sold or manufactured. Our major trademarks include the Old Navy, Gap, Gap Kids, babyGap, Gap Body, GapFit, Gap Teen, Banana Republic, and Athleta trademarks and service marks, and certain other trademarks and service marks. We have obtained and continue to maintain registrations for the aforementioned marks in the United States, Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Japan, China and numerous other countries throughout the world. In addition, we own domain names for our primary trademarks and hold several copyright registrations. We intend to continue to strategically register, both domestically and internationally, trademarks and copyrights that we utilize today and those we develop in the future. We will continue to aggressively police our trademarks and pursue those who infringe, both domestically and internationally. We believe the distinctive trademarks we use in connection with our products are important in building our brand image and distinguishing our products from those of others.
Franchising
We have franchise agreements to operate Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, and Athleta in a number of countries throughout Asia, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores and websites that sell apparel and related products under our brand names. For additional information on risks related to our franchise business, see the sections entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Operating a Global Business—Our efforts to expand internationally may not be successful” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Operating a Global Business—Our franchise and licensing businesses are subject to certain risks not directly within our control that could impair the value of our brands” in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K. 
Inventory
The nature of the retail business requires us to carry a significant amount of inventory, especially prior to the peak holiday selling season when we, along with other retailers, generally build up inventory levels. We maintain a large part of our inventory in distribution centers. We review our inventory levels in order to identify slow-moving merchandise and broken assortments (items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes or colors) and we primarily use promotions and markdowns to clear merchandise. For additional information on risks related to our inventory, see the below sections in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K. 
•“Risks Related to Our Brand Relevance and Brand Execution—We must successfully gauge apparel trends and changing consumer preferences to succeed,” 
•"Risks Related to Human Capital, Inventory and Supply Chain Management—If we are unable to manage our inventory effectively, our results of operations could be adversely affected" and
•"Risks Related to Operating a Global Business—Our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, negative global climate patterns, or other catastrophic events"
Competitors
The global apparel retail industry is highly competitive. We compete with local, national, and global apparel retailers. For additional information on risks related to competition, see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Competition—Our business is highly competitive” in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K.
Human Capital 
As of January 28, 2023, we had a workforce of approximately 95,000 employees. We also hire seasonal employees, primarily during the peak holiday selling season. As of January 28, 2023, approximately 81 percent of employees worked in retail locations, approximately 9 percent of employees worked in headquarters locations, and approximately 10 percent of employees worked in distribution centers. In addition, as of that date, approximately 81 percent of employees were located in the U.S. and approximately 19 percent of employees were located outside of the U.S., with a majority of those non-U.S. based employees located in Canada and Asia.
We know that in order to remain competitive in the retail apparel industry, we must attract, develop, and retain skilled employees in our design, merchandising, supply chain, marketing, information technology, and other functions, as well as in our stores and distribution centers. Competition for such personnel is intense. Our success is dependent to a significant degree on the continued contributions of our employees. We understand the importance of human capital and prioritize building talent; diversity and inclusion; ensuring pay equity; gathering and actioning on employee feedback; and supporting the health, wellness, and safety of our employees, customers, and communities.
Building Talent. We invest in our employees through accessible resources and structured training programs that offer opportunities for development. Currently, we offer functional and technical training to our employees in our stores, distribution centers, and headquarters. We have historically created, managed, or offered a collection of development courses for employees that cover a range of subjects. 
Diversity and Inclusion. We offer our employees extensive programs and resource groups that foster diversity and inclusion. In addition, we have established nine Company-wide commitments to foster racial equality. Information about our commitments is available on our website (www.gapinc.com) under "Values, Equality & Belonging, Our Commitments." We are also committed to greater transparency and have publicly reported our global employee gender data and overall U.S. race and ethnicity data since 2007, and since 2021 we have shared additional data on how our U.S. employees identify their race and ethnicity at stores, distribution centers and headquarters. In fiscal 2022, we also published our second dedicated Equality & Belonging Report to talk openly about our progress and the lessons we are learning along the way.
Pay Equity. Since 2014, we have conducted annual reviews of our pay data by gender, and in 2020 we began using an external firm to assess our pay data by race for all U.S. employees. 
Employee Feedback. We value our employees' feedback and use opinion surveys as a critical component of our ongoing listening strategy. We use these insights to understand what is important to our employees and to determine where we should focus our investments and build new programs and strategies that help us create a thriving, productive work environment. We have modernized our approach to soliciting employee feedback on topical issues to capture data so we can understand and respond faster to employees' needs. We also collect feedback about our employees' work experience during performance reviews.
Health, Wellness and Safety. Protecting the health and safety of our employees, customers and communities is a top priority. Our store and distribution center employees are trained on safe work practices and learn procedural knowledge through on-the-job training programs that are aligned to industry and Occupational Safety & Health standards. Our internal Safety and Claims teams analyze risks and collaborate with operational leaders to understand and adjust business practices to align with emerging trends, and our Internal Audit team gauges procedural compliance at distribution centers and stores. We continue to monitor all official COVID-19 pandemic recommendations from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, local government mandates and current COVID-19 data trends to make adjustments to our policies.
Human Capital Oversight. The Board of Directors (the "Board") and its Compensation and Management Development Committee oversee human capital issues. The Compensation and Management Development Committee has formal oversight over the Company's policies and strategies relating to its human capital management function, including policies, processes and strategies relating to employee recruitment, retention, appraisal and development; talent management; workplace culture and employee engagement; workforce diversity, equity and inclusion and any goals related thereto; and the Company's general approach to broad-based compensation, benefits, workplace and employment practices, as outlined in its charter. The Committee regularly receives reports on talent, succession planning, and diversity and inclusion. On a quarterly basis, the Committee receives a talent dashboard with key metrics, including employee survey feedback and turnover information. The Committee engages periodically on compensation program design for all employees at all levels.
For additional information on risks related to our human capital management, see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Human Capital, Inventory and Supply Chain Management—Our failure to manage key executive succession and retention and to continue to attract qualified personnel could adversely affect our results of operations” in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K.
