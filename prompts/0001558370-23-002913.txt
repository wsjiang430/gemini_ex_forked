Overview
We are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company leading a new treatment paradigm to improve the lives of patients suffering from pruritus. Our KORSUVA injection is the first and only FDA approved treatment for moderate-to-severe pruritus associated with chronic kidney disease, or CKD, in adults undergoing hemodialysis. We are developing an oral formulation of difelikefalin and have initiated Phase 3 programs for the treatment of pruritus in patients with NDD-CKD, and atopic dermatitis, or AD. We have also initiated a Phase 2/3 program of oral difelikefalin for the treatment of moderate-to-severe pruritus in patients with NP.

Chronic Pruritus – Overview of the Unmet Need 
Pruritus, or itch, is defined as an unpleasant sensation that provokes the desire to scratch, which can range from a mild annoyance to an intractable, disabling condition. Chronic pruritus is a significant unmet need with few if any robustly efficacious or pruritus-specific treatment options. Overall, about one in every eight people globally suffer from chronic pruritus. The condition is often under-reported by patients and therefore under-treated by providers. The result is a significant and sometimes disabling impact on patients’ quality of life.
Chronic pruritus occurs in primarily three broad disease categories: systemic diseases, dermatologic diseases, and neurologic diseases. Numerous diseases fall into each of these categories, with each of them having pruritus as a key symptomatic feature. 
Systemic diseases with associated pruritus include endocrine and metabolic diseases such as CKD and chronic liver disease like PBC, infectious diseases, hematologic and lymphoproliferative diseases, visceral neoplasms, and drug-induced pruritus.
Dermatologic diseases with associated pruritus include inflammatory dermatoses – such as AD, infectious dermatoses, autoimmune dermatoses, neoplasms, genodermatoses, and dermatoses of pregnancy.
Neurologic diseases associated with pruritus include NP, brachioradial pruritus and post-herpetic neuralgia.
Each one of these disease categories has potential as an area of exploration for our lead compound, difelikefalin. The unaddressed unmet need remains substantial. According to a study we conducted with IQVIA utilizing medical claims data from 2019, or the IQVIA study, approximately 23 million patients were diagnosed with diseases associated with chronic pruritus and received a prescription for an anti-pruritic agent such as corticosteroids, antihistamines, select antidepressants, counterirritants, bile acid sequestrants, rifampin, narcotic antagonists, and partial agonists, topical immunomodulators or gabapentin. 
Role of Difelikefalin in Chronic Pruritus
Recent advancements in the understanding of the biology of pruritus have led to the discovery of novel targets in the central nervous system, or CNS, and a unique pathway central to chronic pruritus. Pruritus, commonly referred to as itch, originates in the epidermis and dermal–epidermal junction and is transmitted by itch-selective sensory neuron C

​

fibers, or pruriceptors. Some of these fibers are sensitive to histamine while others are not, and there is evidence for histamine-insensitive C fibers that are activated by numerous itch-inducing substances or pruritogens, many of which initiate signals through interaction with specific G-protein-coupled receptors. In addition, there is increasing evidence for the differential involvement of these systems in various forms of itch which may involve disease-specific pruritogens. As an example, chronic pruritus associated with kidney failure is thought to involve complex interactions among peripheral cells (T cells, mast cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, and keratinocytes) and histamine-insensitive nerve fibers, involving increased release of cytokines, proteases, and neuropeptides, interacting with multiple receptors that lead to exacerbation of itch. 
These different peripheral cell types express kappa opioid receptors, or KORs, which can regulate the release of these pruritogenic substances, while the KORs on C fibers are thought to regulate their response to these pruritogens. Because KORs are expressed in peripheral tissues, there is a potential to modulate itch signals peripherally without impacting the central KORs. The itch-sensitive sensory nerve fibers transmit signals to the cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglia (that also have KORs), which send fibers to enter the spinal cord. Itch signals then ascend via the spinothalamic tract to multiple brain areas for sensory processing and interactions with cognitive and other systems. Additionally, the activation of kappa receptors via an agonist is thought to reduce itching by functionally counteracting increased mu opioid receptor activity which is suggested to be associated with some chronic forms of pruritus. Activation of the mu opioid receptor in the brain and in the peripheral nerve endings results in itching while non-selective mu opioid antagonists can inhibit itching. KOR stimulation inhibits the effects of mu receptor activation both centrally and peripherally. 
Our novel compound, difelikefalin, is a highly selective, predominantly peripherally acting KOR agonist. Its design includes specific characteristics that limit entry into the CNS. As a KOR agonist, difelikefalin’s mechanism of action turns off the itch sensation by acting on the peripheral neurons responsible for sensing pruritus. In other words, difelikefalin disrupts the itch sensation of chronic pruritus at the nerve level. In addition, difelikefalin acts on KORs expressed on a range of activated immune cells to subsequently block the release of pruritogenic cytokines. A central hypothesis driving our development work is that by acting on peripheral nerves that sense pruritus, difelikefalin may be able to address pruritus regardless of the underlying disease. 
Our Strategy
Our mission is to become the leader in the treatment of chronic pruritus and transform the way pruritus is treated to improve the quality of life for millions of people who suffer from this condition. 
Our goal is to maximize the potential and utility of our unique compound, difelikefalin, a selective KOR agonist for the treatment chronic pruritus, across our two core franchises, nephrology and medical dermatology. We believe this will drive both near and long-term growth and create significant value for all our stakeholders. To achieve our goal, we are pursuing the following strategies:

● | Expanding our Nephrology Franchise by optimizing the commercial potential of KORSUVA injection and developing oral difelikefalin for the treatment of pruritus in earlier stages of chronic kidney disease:
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Nephrology Franchise is anchored in our lead product, KORSUVA injection, the first and only FDA approved treatment for moderate-to-severe pruritus associated with chronic kidney disease in adults undergoing hemodialysis. We estimate the addressable patient population to be around 200,000 patients in the United States alone with similar size patient pools in other regions around the world.  KORSUVA injection is a global brand with additional approvals in the EU, UK, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates, or UAE, using the trade name Kapruvia in some of these countries. Our partner CSL Vifor is leading the commercialization of KORSUVA injection in all countries except Japan and South Korea with the goal to educate providers and patients on the unmet medical need and drive utilization of KORSUVA injection thereby maximizing its commercial potential. 
Our intent is to build upon our existing KORSUVA injection approval and expand the utility of difelikefalin by moving to earlier stage CKD patients with the oral formulation. In 2022, we initiated a Phase 3 program in

​

advanced CKD stages IV-V for patients who are not on dialysis. Like in the dialysis setting, there are no approved therapies and expanding to this population will roughly double our addressable market if oral difelikefalin is approved for this indication.   
​

● | Building a Medical Dermatology Franchise by executing our late stage clinical programs in Atopic Dermatitis and Notalgia Paresthetica:
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Our Dermatology Franchise is focused on developing oral difelikefalin in pruritus associated with AD and NP, two complementary indications with the same medical dermatology call point. 
​
AD is the most common of the inflammatory dermatologic conditions and pruritus is the primary symptom. The vast majority of patients have mild-to-moderate disease and many of them suffer from moderate-to-severe pruritus. We estimate this itch-dominant population to represent roughly 3 million patients. Most of these patients receive topical steroids to address the inflammation but there are no approved systemic therapies to target pruritus. In 2022, we initiated a Phase 3 program in this population with the goal to develop the first systemic, symptomatic therapy focused on pruritus in AD.
​
NP is a neuropathic disorder that is characterized by significant pruritus in the upper back. We estimate that approximately 650,000 patients with NP are currently in the care of a provider. Like the other indications we are pursuing, there is a significant unmet need as there are no approved therapies to treat NP. We recently initiated a Phase 2/3 program with the intent to develop the first treatment indicated for pruritus associated with this underdiagnosed and undertreated condition. 
​
We believe our strategy, which is anchored in the clinical profile and benefit of difelikefalin seen in our trials to date, will maximize the potential of our difelikefalin and lead to sustainable, long-term growth for our company.

KORSUVA (difelikefalin) injection – Our Commercial Product
Overview
On August 23, 2021, our lead product, KORSUVA injection, was approved by the FDA for the treatment of moderate-to-severe pruritus associated with CKD in adults undergoing hemodialysis. In December 2021, CMS granted Transition Drug Add-on Payment Adjustment, or TDAPA, to KORSUVA injection in the anti-pruritic functional category. TDAPA went into effect on April 1, 2022, for a minimum of two years. The commercial launch of KORSUVA injection commenced in April 2022 and we began recording the associated profit-sharing revenues in the second quarter of 2022. We are partnering with CSL Vifor to commercialize KORSUVA injection in dialysis patients with CKD-aP worldwide, excluding Japan (Maruishi/sub-licensee Kissei), and South Korea (CKDP). For the year ended December 31, 2022, CSL Vifor recorded net sales of KORSUVA injection in the United States of approximately $35.0 million and we recorded associated collaborative revenue of $16.6 million which represented our share of the profit from these sales.
In April 2022, the European Commission granted marketing authorization to difelikefalin injection under the brand name Kapruvia for the treatment of moderate-to-severe pruritus associated with chronic kidney disease in adult

​

hemodialysis patients. The marketing authorization approves Kapruvia for use in all member states of the EU, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway. Kapruvia was also approved in the UK in April 2022. Commercial launches in Austria, Germany, Sweden, and Denmark have commenced and we expect the remaining EU countries to launch in 2023. In August 2022, as part of the Access Consortium, difelikefalin injection was approved in Switzerland under the brand name Kapruvia, as well as in Singapore and Canada under the brand name KORSUVA. In November 2022, difelikefalin injection was approved in the last Access Consortium country, Australia, under the brand name KORSUVA. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded royalty revenue of approximately $72,000 which represented our royalties on net sales of Kapruvia in Europe.
In addition, our partner in Japan, Maruishi, announced positive Phase 3 top-line data in January 2022. Maruishi and its sublicensee Kissei confirmed the primary endpoint was achieved in a Japanese Phase 3 clinical study (double-blind, placebo-controlled period) of difelikefalin injection for the treatment of pruritus in hemodialysis patients. In the Phase 3 study, 178 patients were administered difelikefalin or placebo for 6 weeks followed by an open-label extension period of difelikefalin administration for 52 weeks. The primary endpoint, change in itch numerical rating scale, or NRS, and the secondary endpoint, change in itch scores of Shiratori severity criteria, were significantly improved from baseline compared to the placebo group. Difelikefalin was well-tolerated. 
​
In September 2022, Maruishi submitted a New Drug Application in Japan for the approval of difelikefalin injection for the treatment of pruritus in hemodialysis patients. A final decision on the application is expected in the second half of 2023.
​
In January 2023, Vifor Fresenius Medical Care Renal Pharma Ltd. and Winhealth Pharma signed a long-term exclusive licensing agreement for the co-development and commercialization of KORSUVA injection for the treatment of moderate-to-severe pruritus in adult patients undergoing hemodialysis in China.
​
Pruritus in CKD in Adults on Dialysis: 
CKD is a clinical condition wherein progressive kidney damage leads to an impairment of kidney function over time. Primary risk factors culminating into CKD include diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, or hereditary renal disease. Early-stage disease is generally associated with few mild clinical manifestations; however, CKD can progress to kidney failure or ESRD which is fatal without dialysis or transplantation. According to the National Kidney Foundation, ESRD is estimated to affect approximately 750,000 individuals per year in the United States, of which approximately 500,000 patients undergo regular dialysis.
Chronic pruritus is one of the many comorbidities of CKD in patients undergoing dialysis, characterized by a highly unpleasant and irritating sensation that triggers an urge to scratch the skin. CKD-aP adversely affects patient quality of life and can result in infections, sleep-deprivation, depression, and even increased risk of mortality. 
CKD-aP’s intractable systemic itch has a high prevalence. According to Fresenius Medical Care, a world leading provider of products and medical care for dialysis patients, there were approximately 3.2 million patients globally undergoing dialysis in 2017. According to the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study published in December 2017 in the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrologists, it is estimated that nearly 70% of these patients suffer from some form of CKD-aP with approximately 40% of these patients experiencing moderate to severe pruritus.
Summary of the Clinical Results for KORSUVA injection/Kapruvia:
KORSUVA injection was approved by the FDA on August 23, 2021 and is the first and only product approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe pruritus associated with CKD in adult patients undergoing hemodialysis in the United States.
It was approved based on the NDA filing that was supported by positive data from two pivotal Phase 3 trials – KALMTM-1, conducted in the United States, and KALM-2 conducted globally, as well as supportive data from an additional 32 clinical studies. KORSUVA injection was found to be generally well tolerated in the pivotal studies highlighted below.

​

In April 2020, we announced positive top-line results from the double blinded KALM-2 pivotal Phase 3 trial of KORSUVA injection in hemodialysis patients with moderate-to-severe CKD-aP. The study met the primary efficacy endpoint with 54% of the patients receiving 0.5 mcg/kg of KORSUVA injection vs. 42% of patients receiving placebo achieving at least a three-point improvement from baseline with respect to the weekly mean of the daily 24-hour worst itch intensity NRS at week 12 (p= 0.02). The study also met the key secondary endpoint with 41% of patients receiving KORSUVA injection achieving a four-point or greater improvement from baseline in the weekly mean of the daily 24-hour worst itch NRS score at week 12 vs. 28% for patients receiving placebo (p= 0.01). In this trial, KORSUVA injection was generally well-tolerated with a safety profile consistent with that seen in KALM-1 and the KORSUVA clinical program in patients with CKD-aP. 
Overall, the incidence of adverse effects, or AEs, and serious AEs were similar across both KORSUVA injection and placebo groups. The most common treatment emergent AEs reported in greater than 5% of patients were diarrhea (8.1% KORSUVA vs. 5.5% placebo), falls (6.8% KORSUVA vs. 5.1% placebo), vomiting (6.4% KORSUVA vs. 5.9% placebo), nausea (6.4% KORSUVA vs. 4.2% placebo) and dizziness (5.5% KORSUVA vs. 5.1% placebo).
In May 2019, we announced positive results from the double blinded phase of our KALM-1 pivotal Phase 3 trial of KORSUVA injection in hemodialysis patients with moderate-to-severe CKD-aP. The study met the primary efficacy endpoint with 51% of the patients receiving 0.5 mcg/kg of KORSUVA injection vs. 28% of patients receiving placebo achieving at least a three-point improvement from baseline with respect to the weekly mean of the daily 24-hour worst itch intensity NRS score at week 12 (p= 0.000019). The study also met all secondary endpoints, including assessment of itch-related quality of life changes measured using self-assessment Skindex-10 (patients receiving KORSUVA experienced 43% improvement vs. patients receiving placebo, p= 0.0004) and 5-D Itch scales (patients receiving KORSUVA experienced 35% improvement vs. patients receiving placebo, p= 0.0009). In addition, 39% of patients receiving KORSUVA injection achieved a four-point or greater improvement from baseline in the weekly mean of the daily 24-hour worst itch NRS score at week 12 vs. 18% of patients receiving placebo (p= 0.000032), another key secondary endpoint. In this trial, KORSUVA injection was generally well-tolerated with a safety profile consistent with that seen in earlier trials. 
Overall, the incidence of AEs and serious AEs were similar across both KORSUVA injection and placebo groups. The most common treatment emergent AEs reported in greater than 5% of patients were diarrhea (9.5% KORSUVA vs. 3.7% placebo), dizziness (6.9% KORSUVA vs. 1.1% placebo), vomiting (5.3% KORSUVA vs. 3.2% placebo) and nasopharyngitis (3.2% KORSUVA vs. 5.3% placebo).
KORSUVA Injection U.S. Launch Progress
​
In April 2022, our partner CSL Vifor initiated the commercialization of KORSUVA injection in the United States. The launch was initially driven by independent and mid-size dialysis organizations coupled with product stocking at the wholesaler level. In the third quarter of 2022, large dialysis organizations, or LDOs, came on-line driving a significant quarter-to-quarter increase in order volume from the wholesaler. Specifically, Fresenius placed large orders to drive the trial and adoption of KORSUVA injection across its entire network of clinics. In the third quarter of 2022, CSL Vifor also contracted the sales force of Fresenius Renal Pharmaceuticals, a division of Fresenius Medical Care North America, to complement CSL Vifor’s sales force in selling into Fresenius clinics in the United States. After the initial inventory building at both the wholesaler and certain clinics (primarily, Fresenius), we have started to see shipments to dialysis organizations reflect true end-user demand versus the stocking activity seen in prior quarters.

Oral Difelikefalin in Non-Dialysis-Dependent Chronic Kidney Disease (NDD-CKD) Associated Pruritus
CKD-aP is a frequent and wearisome symptom in patients with NDD-CKD. We initiated a Phase 3 program with oral difelikefalin for the treatment of pruritus in NDD-CKD, specifically in patients diagnosed with Stage IV and V advanced CKD. There are approximately 1.2 million patients diagnosed with Stage IV and V CKD in the United States and approximately 300,000 of these patients suffer from moderate-to-severe pruritus.
There are no FDA-approved treatment options specifically for this indication in the United States or Europe. Patients are generally managed with a multitude of products including corticosteroids, gabapentin, antihistamines, antidepressants, and other therapies with varying degrees of success. There is one product, nalfurafine (Remitch®) marketed by Toray Industries, approved to treat CKD-aP in Japan, but it is not approved in either the United States or Europe.
In December 2019, we announced top-line data from our Phase 2 trial of oral difelikefalin for the treatment of pruritus in NDD–CKD patients diagnosed with Stage III – V CKD. The Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week trial was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of three dosage strengths (0.25 mg, 0.5 mg and 1 mg, once daily administration) of oral difelikefalin vs. placebo in approximately 240 stage III - V (moderate-to-severe) CKD patients with moderate-to-severe pruritus. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in the weekly mean of the daily 24-hour worst itch NRS score at week 12 of the treatment period. Secondary endpoints included change from baseline in itch-related quality of life scores at the end of week 12, as assessed by the total Skindex-10 and 5-D itch scores, as well as the proportion of patients achieving an improvement from baseline ≥3 points with respect to the weekly mean of the daily 24-hour worst itch NRS score at week 12.
Patients treated with the 1 mg dosage strength of oral difelikefalin achieved the primary endpoint of statistically significant reduction in weekly mean of the daily worst itch NRS scores vs. placebo after the 12-week treatment period (-4.4 difelikefalin vs. -3.3 placebo, p=0.018). The treatment was statistically significant after two weeks of treatment with sustained benefit through the 12-week treatment period. Regarding secondary endpoints, the proportion of patients on 1 mg tablet strength achieving a 3 point or greater improvement from baseline in the weekly mean of the daily worst itch NRS score at week 12 was 72% vs. 58% for placebo but did not achieve statistical significance. Furthermore, 

11



​

patients on 1 mg dosage strength showed positive improvements vs. placebo in itch quality of life endpoints as measured by the self-assessment Skindex-10 and 5-D Itch scales but this did not achieve statistical significance. 
Oral difelikefalin was generally well-tolerated with a safety profile consistent with that seen in earlier KORSUVA clinical trials. Overall, the incidence of treatment AEs were similar across difelikefalin and placebo groups. The most common AEs reported in >5% of patients in the 1 mg difelikefalin group vs. placebo were dizziness (7.5% difelikefalin vs. 0% placebo), fall (6% difelikefalin vs. 0% placebo), diarrhea (6% difelikefalin vs. 1.5% placebo) and constipation (6% difelikefalin vs. 3% placebo).
In April 2021, we held an End of Phase 2 Meeting with the FDA to discuss the results of the Phase 2 trial of oral difelikefalin in NDD-CKD and the potential Phase 3 program. The FDA indicated the acceptability of Stage V pre-dialysis CKD patients as a viable patient population for a program. In November 2021, the FDA provided written guidance indicating the patient population can be expanded to include the group of Stage IV pre-dialysis patients with advanced CKD in a registration program consisting of two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials. 
In the first quarter of 2022, we initiated the Phase 3 NDD-CKD program. The Phase 3 program consists of two identical trials (U.S. and global), KICK 1 and KICK 2. Each trial is expected to enroll approximately 400 patients, who will be randomized 1:1 to either oral difelikefalin 1 mg once daily or matching placebo. The study population will include adult patients suffering from moderate-to-severe pruritus with advanced CKD in Stages IV or V, not on dialysis. The primary endpoint will be the proportion of patients with a ≥4-point improvement at Week 12 from baseline in the worst-itch NRS after which patients will be re-randomized to either oral difelikefalin or placebo for 52-weeks. We expect to report top-line results from this program in the second half of 2024.
Our Dermatology Franchise
Atopic Dermatitis and Associated Pruritus
AD is a chronic, pruritic inflammatory dermatosis that affects up to 25% of children and 2% to 5% of adults. Chronic pruritus is one of the defining features of AD. The itch is so common in AD that AD is often described as the itch that rashes. The point prevalence of chronic pruritus ranges between 87% to 100% in AD. According to a study published in Allergy in 2018, the point prevalence in adults in the United States is 4.9%, or approximately 12 million adults. Both quality of life and psychosocial well-being are known to negatively correlate with itch severity. The associated psychosocial morbidity of this distressing symptom includes sleep disruption, depression, agitation, anxiety, altered eating habits, reduced self-esteem and difficulty concentrating. 
AD patients can be segmented into groups based on the severity of their skin lesions as well as the severity of their itch. In a study published in Annals of Allergy, Asthma Immunology in 2021, it was found that nearly 25% of AD patients had mild-to-moderate lesions but still had severe pruritus. This “itch dominant” AD phenotype has a significant unmet medical need as their skin lesions have been controlled, but their severe itch has persisted. Most times, these patients have tried available agents (i.e., topical therapies, including corticosteroids, antihistamines) to control pruritus related to their AD unsuccessfully resulting in a significant patient population that needs a systemic agent for pruritus relief. 
Oral difelikefalin for the Treatment of Moderate-to-Severe Pruritus Associated with Atopic Dermatitis (AD)
In April 2021, we announced top-line data from our Phase 2 KARE clinical trial. The KARE Phase 2 trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral difelikefalin for moderate-to-severe pruritus in 401 adult subjects with AD-aP. KARE enrolled 64% of patients characterized as mild-to-moderate AD (Body Surface Area, or BSA, <10%) and 36% as moderate-to-severe AD (BSA>10%). Subjects were randomized to three dosage strengths of oral difelikefalin: 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg and 1 mg taken twice daily (BID) vs. matching placebo for 12 weeks followed by 4 weeks of an open-label active extension phase. A prespecified interim conditional power assessment was conducted after approximately 50% of the originally targeted patient number completed the 12-week treatment period. Based on the Independent Data Monitoring Committee’s recommendation, the sample size for each of the 0.5 mg dose and placebo groups were increased, taking the total trial size up by 28%.

​

​
KARE’s primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in the weekly mean of the daily 24-hour Itch NRS score at week 12 of the treatment period for the intent to treat, or ITT, population. Although no dose group met this endpoint, a statistically significant improvement from baseline was evident as early as week 1 for the 1 mg dose group, which was sustained through 75% of the treatment period. 
​
In a prespecified analysis, a statistically significant change in the primary efficacy endpoint was observed in the mild-to-moderate (BSA<10%) AD patient population (p=0.036, All doses vs. placebo), which was evident at week 1 and sustained through the 12-week treatment period.
The key secondary endpoint for KARE was the assessment of the proportion of patients achieving an improvement from baseline of ≥4 points with respect to the weekly mean of the daily 24-hour Itch NRS score at week 12 (4-point Responder Analysis). No dose group met this endpoint for the ITT population. 
A prespecified analysis by disease severity indicated a statistically significant improvement in the 4-point Responder Analysis in the mild-to-moderate (BSA<10%) AD patient population with 33% of difelikefalin-treated patients achieving a ≥4-point reduction in NRS at Week 12 vs. 19% in the placebo group for the 0.5 mg dose (p=0.046). All doses performed similarly (0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, and 1 mg) vs. placebo. Oral difelikefalin was generally well-tolerated across all doses. 
In the first quarter of 2022, we initiated a Phase 3 program for the treatment of moderate-to-severe pruritus in AD patients. The pivotal Phase 3 program for difelikefalin in AD comprises two studies: KIND 1 and KIND 2 and will investigate the use of oral difelikefalin as adjunctive treatment to topical corticosteroids. The KIND 1 study will be composed of two parts: Part A and Part B. 
KIND 1 and KIND 2 will be double-blind, controlled, 12-week studies with patients allowed to roll-over into open label 52-week extensions. Part A of KIND 1, the dose finding portion of the trial, is expected to include 280 patients who will be randomized equally to four arms (0.25 mg BID + TCS, 0.5 mg BID + TCS, placebo BID + TCS, placebo BID + vehicle). At the end of the 12-week treatment period in Part A of KIND 1, we expect to have an internal data read out targeted for the second half of 2023. This readout will provide key information, specifically the dose and the sample size to initiate Part B of KIND 1 and KIND 2. Part B and KIND 2 will be identical in design. They will be double-blind, controlled, 12-week studies with patients randomized 1:1 to either difelikefalin or matching placebo as adjunct treatment to topical corticosteroids. The difelikefalin dose is expected to be based on the results from Part A of KIND 1. The primary endpoint will be the proportion of patients with a ≥4-point improvement at Week 12 from baseline in the worst itch NRS.
The studies will include adult patients with AD whose chronic pruritus has not been adequately controlled by topical therapy alone and who have had chronic pruritus of moderate-to-severe intensity for ≥6 weeks (worst itch NRS of ≥ 5). Patients must have an Investigator Global Assessment ≥ 2 and a BSA ≤20%. We will stratify patients to a BSA <10% or ≥ 10% with the aim to enroll 85% of patients with a BSA <10%.
​
We expect to release top-line results for both KIND 1 Part B and KIND 2 in the first half of 2025.
​
Notalgia Paresthetica and Associated Pruritus
​
NP is a common, neurosensory condition caused by alteration and damage to thoracic spinal nerves and is characterized by chronic pruritus in the upper back. It is estimated that chronic pruritus affects up to 13% of the U.S. population. NP falls within the subcategory of chronic neuropathic pruritus which comprises approximately 8% of all cases of chronic pruritus. We estimate that approximately 650,000 adult patients with NP associated pruritus are in the care of a healthcare provider. 
There are no FDA-approved treatments for NP. The management of NP is challenging and conventional treatments for pruritus, such as antihistamines and topical steroids, are largely ineffective.

Oral Difelikefalin for Treatment of Moderate-to-Severe Pruritus Associated with Notalgia Paresthetica (NP)
In June 2022, we announced positive top-line results from the proof-of-concept Phase 2 KOMFORT trial of oral difelikefalin for the treatment of pruritus in patients with NP. 
KOMFORT was a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral difelikefalin for moderate-to-severe pruritus in 125 adult patients with NP and moderate-to-severe pruritus. Patients were randomized to receive oral difelikefalin 2 mg twice daily (BID) vs. matching placebo for eight weeks followed by a 4-week open-label active extension period and follow-up visit approximately 14 days after the last dose of the study drug. 
KOMFORT’s primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in the weekly mean of the daily 24-hour worst itch NRS score at week 8 of the treatment period. Patients treated with oral difelikefalin achieved the primary endpoint (-4.0 difelikefalin vs. -2.4 placebo, p=0.001) with statistically significant improvement observed as early as Week 1 and sustained through Week 8. 
Other endpoints included a ≥4-point improvement in worst itch NRS, complete response in worst itch NRS, and safety assessments. A statistically significantly greater proportion of patients treated with oral difelikefalin achieved a ≥4-point improvement in worst itch NRS score at Week 8 vs. placebo (41% difelikefalin vs. 18% placebo, p=0.007). In addition, oral difelikefalin met the complete response endpoint, defined as a worst itch NRS score of 0 or 1 for 70% of the daily non-missing worst itch NRS scores for the week. At Week 8, a significantly greater proportion of patients receiving oral difelikefalin vs. placebo achieved a complete response (22% difelikefalin vs. 5% placebo, p<0.01).
Oral difelikefalin was generally well tolerated, with all AEs in difelikefalin-treated patients reported as mild or moderate in severity. Nausea, headache, dizziness, constipation, and increased urine output were more commonly reported in patients on difelikefalin. 
In November 2022, we had a positive interaction with the FDA leading to the initiation of a Phase 2/3 program for the treatment of chronic pruritus associated with NP. In February 2023, the results of our KOMFORT Phase 2 trial were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
In the first quarter of 2023, we initiated a Phase 2/3 program for the treatment of moderate-to-severe pruritus in NP patients. The Phase 2/3 program for difelikefalin in NP will comprise two studies: KOURAGE 1 and KOURAGE 2. The KOURAGE 1 study will be composed of two parts: Part A and Part B. 
KOURAGE 1 and KOURAGE 2 will be double-blind, placebo-controlled, 8-week studies with patients allowed to roll-over into open label 52-week extensions. Part A of KOURAGE 1, the dose finding portion of the trial, is expected to include 200 patients who will be randomized equally to four arms (0.25 mg BID, 1.0 mg BID, 2.0 mg BID, placebo BID). At the end of the 8-week treatment period in Part A of KOURAGE 1, we expect to have an internal data read out targeted for the second half of 2024. This readout will provide key information, specifically the dose and the sample size to initiate Part B of KOURAGE 1 and KOURAGE 2. Part B and KOURAGE 2 will be identical in design. They will be double-blind, placebo-controlled, 8-week studies with patients randomized 1:1 to either difelikefalin or matching placebo. The difelikefalin dose is expected to be based on the results from Part A of KOURAGE 1. The primary endpoint will be the proportion of patients with a ≥4-point improvement at Week 8 from baseline in the worst itch NRS.
The studies will include adult patients with NP who have had chronic pruritus of moderate-to-severe intensity for ≥6 months (worst itch NRS of ≥ 5). 
​
We expect to release top-line results for both KOURAGE 1 Part B and KOURAGE 2 in the first half of 2026.

Oral Difelikefalin for the Treatment of Chronic Liver Disease-Associated Pruritus (CLD-aP), Including PBC
We had been evaluating oral difelikefalin in PBC to establish a proof-of-concept in CLD-aP. 
In June 2019, we announced the initiation of a proof-of-concept Phase 2 trial of oral difelikefalin for the treatment of pruritus in patients with hepatic impairment due to PBC. The Phase 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 16-week trial was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 1 mg of oral difelikefalin taken twice daily (BID) vs. placebo in approximately 60 patients with PBC and moderate-to-severe pruritus. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in the weekly mean of the daily 24-hour worst itch NRS score at week 16 of the treatment period. Secondary endpoints include change from baseline in itch-related quality of life scores at the end of week 16 as assessed by the Skindex-10 and 5-D itch scales, as well as the assessment of proportion of patients achieving an improvement from baseline of ≥3 points with respect to the weekly mean of the daily 24-hour worst itch NRS score at week 16.
Based on slow enrollment due primarily to COVID-19, we made a strategic decision to discontinue and unblind the proof-of-concept Phase 2 clinical trial of oral difelikefalin for the treatment of pruritus in patients with PBC. The unblinded data showed no unexpected AEs. However, the low number of patients (N=14) limits the ability to draw a meaningful conclusion regarding the efficacy (worst itch NRS change from baseline at 16 weeks: -3.8 difelikefalin vs. -3.0 placebo) of difelikefalin in this patient population. 
At this time, we plan to focus our resources on our nephrology and dermatology franchises.

​
Maruishi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Maruishi
In April 2013, we entered into a license agreement with Maruishi, or the Maruishi Agreement, under which we granted Maruishi an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize drug products containing difelikefalin in Japan in the acute pain and uremic pruritus fields. Maruishi has a right of first negotiation for any other indications for which we develop difelikefalin and, under certain conditions, Maruishi may substitute another pruritus indication for the uremic pruritus indication originally included in its license from us. Maruishi is required to use commercially reasonable efforts, at its expense, to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize difelikefalin in Japan. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts, at our expense, to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize difelikefalin in the United States.
In January 2022, Maruishi and its sublicensee Kissei confirmed the primary endpoint was achieved in a Japanese Phase 3 clinical study (double-blind, placebo-controlled period) of difelikefalin injection for the treatment of pruritus in hemodialysis patients. In the Phase 3 study, 178 patients were administered difelikefalin or placebo for 6 weeks followed by an open-label extension period of difelikefalin administration for 52 weeks. The primary endpoint, change in itch NRS score, and the secondary endpoint, change in itching scores of Shiratori severity criteria, were significantly improved from baseline compared to the placebo group. Difelikefalin was well-tolerated.
​
In September 2022, Maruishi submitted a New Drug Application in Japan for approval of difelikefalin injection for the treatment of pruritus in hemodialysis patients. A final decision on the application is expected in the second half of 2023.

As of the date of this filing, we have received $2.3 million (before South Korean withholding tax) of development and regulatory milestones. We are also eligible to receive a mid-double-digit percentage of all non-royalty payments received by CKDP from its sublicensees, if any, and tiered royalties ranging from the high single digits to the high teens based on net sales, if any. CKDP’s obligation to pay us royalties continues, on a product-by-product basis, until the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent covering such product or the later expiration of any market exclusivity period. 
The CKDP Agreement continues until CKDP no longer has any obligation to pay us royalties on any product. Either we or CKDP may terminate the CKDP Agreement for the other party’s breach of the CKDP Agreement or bankruptcy. CKDP may terminate the CKDP Agreement if any of the licensed patent rights is invalid, unenforceable, is narrowed in scope or is deemed unpatentable, except as a result of a challenge by CKDP, or a third party commercializes a product containing a compound identical to difelikefalin without infringing any of the licensed patent rights in South Korea. We may terminate the CKDP Agreement if CKDP challenges the licensed patent rights or if a third party in South Korea owns an issued patent that claims difelikefalin and CKDP’s sale of products would infringe that patent. In addition, in connection with the CKDP Agreement, CKDP made a $0.4 million equity investment in our company.
Manufacturing and License Agreements
Polypeptide Laboratories S.A., or PPL
​
In July 2021, we entered into an Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient, or API, Commercial Supply Agreement with Polypeptide Laboratories S.A., or PPL, that defines each party’s responsibilities with respect to PPL’s manufacture and supply of API for the difelikefalin injection product candidate. Under the API Commercial Supply Agreement, PPL shall manufacture API at its facility for sale and supply to us, in the amounts as set forth in purchase orders to be provided by us.

Enteris Biopharma, Inc., or Enteris
In August 2019, we entered into a Non-Exclusive License Agreement, or the Enteris License Agreement, with Enteris. Pursuant to the Enteris License Agreement, Enteris granted to us a non-exclusive, royalty-bearing license, including the right to grant sublicenses, under certain proprietary technology and patent rights related to or covering formulations for oral delivery of peptide active pharmaceutical ingredients with functional excipients to enhance permeability and/or solubility, known as Enteris’s Peptelligence® technology, to develop, manufacture and commercialize products using such technology worldwide, excluding Japan and South Korea. 
As consideration for the licensed rights under the Enteris License Agreement, we paid an upfront fee equal to $8.0 million, consisting of $4.0 million in cash and $4.0 million in shares of our common stock pursuant to the Enteris Purchase Agreement described below.
We are also obligated, pursuant to the Enteris License Agreement, to pay Enteris (1) milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones and (2) low-single digit royalty percentages on net sales of licensed products, subject to reductions in specified circumstances. Until the second anniversary of the entry into the Enteris License Agreement, we had the right, but not the obligation, to terminate our obligation to pay any royalties under the Enteris License Agreement in exchange for a lump sum payment in cash, or the Royalty Buyout. We did not exercise our Royalty Buyout right and such right expired in August 2021. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we paid $5.0 million, $15.0 million, and $5.0 million, respectively, to Enteris for milestones earned in relation to the Enteris License Agreement, which were recorded in R&D expense for the respective periods.
The Enteris License Agreement will expire on a country-by-country, licensed product-by-licensed product basis upon the later of (1) the expiration (or invalidation) of all valid claims in licensed patent rights that cover such product in such country, (2) the end of the calendar quarter in which generic competition (as defined in the Enteris License Agreement) occurs for such product in such country and (3) ten years from the first commercial sale of such product.
Either party may terminate the Enteris License Agreement upon written notice if the other party has failed to remedy a material breach within 60 days (or 30 days in the case of a material breach of a payment obligation). Enteris may terminate the Enteris License Agreement upon 30 days’ written notice to us if we or any of our affiliates formally challenge the validity of any licensed patent rights or assists a third party in doing so. We may terminate the Enteris License Agreement for any reason or no reason (a) prior to receipt of first regulatory approval for a licensed product in the United States for any indication upon 30 days’ prior written notice to Enteris or (b) on or after receipt of first regulatory approval for a licensed product in the United States for any indication upon 60 days’ prior written notice to Enteris.
In August 2019, in connection with the Enteris License Agreement, we entered into the Enteris Purchase Agreement with Enteris and its affiliate, EBP Holdco LLC, collectively referred to as Purchaser, pursuant to which we issued and sold to Purchaser 170,793 shares of our common stock in a private placement. Such shares were issued in satisfaction of the $4.0 million portion of the upfront fee payable in shares of our common stock pursuant to the Enteris License Agreement and for no additional consideration, based on a purchase price of $23.42 per share, which was equal to the 30-day volume weighted average price of our common stock on August 20, 2019. Pursuant to the Enteris Purchase Agreement, we effected the registration and sale of the shares issued and sold to Purchaser thereunder in accordance with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, which included the filing of a registration statement with the SEC on September 9, 2019. In addition, the Purchase Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants by us.

​

Patheon UK Limited, or Patheon
In July 2019, we entered into a Master Services Agreement, or MSA, with Patheon UK Limited, or Patheon. The MSA governs the general terms under which Patheon, or one of its affiliates, will provide non-exclusive manufacturing services to us for the drug products specified by us from time to time. Pursuant to the MSA, we have agreed to order from Patheon at least a certain percentage of our commercial requirements for a product under a related Product Agreement. Each Product Agreement that we may enter into from time to time will be governed by the terms of the MSA, unless expressly modified in such Product Agreement.
The MSA has an initial term ending December 31, 2024, and will automatically renew after the initial term for successive terms of two years each if there is a Product Agreement in effect, unless either party gives notice of its intention to terminate the MSA at least 18 months prior to the end of the then current term.
Either party may terminate the MSA or a Product Agreement upon written notice if the other party (1) has failed to remedy a material breach within a specified time or (2) is declared insolvent or bankrupt, voluntarily files a petition of bankruptcy or assigns such agreement for the benefit of creditors. We may terminate a Product Agreement (a) upon 90 days’ prior written notice if any governmental agency takes any action that prevents us from selling the relevant product in the relevant territory, (b) upon six months’ prior written notice if we do not intend to order manufacturing services due to a product’s discontinuance in the market, or (c) upon 90 days’ prior written notice if we determine that the manufacture or supply of a product likely infringes third-party rights. Patheon may terminate the MSA or a Product Agreement (i) upon six months’ prior written notice if we assign such agreement to an assignee that is unacceptable to Patheon for certain reasons, or (ii) upon 30 days’ prior written notice if, after the first year of commercial sales, we forecast zero volume for 12 months.
The MSA contains, among other provisions, customary representations and warranties by the parties, a grant to Patheon of certain limited license rights to our intellectual property in connection with Patheon’s performance of the services under the MSA, certain indemnification rights in favor of both parties, limitations of liability and customary confidentiality provisions.
Also in July 2019, we entered into two related Product Agreements under the MSA, one with each of Patheon and Patheon Manufacturing Services LLC, or Patheon Greenville, to govern the terms and conditions of the manufacture of commercial supplies of difelikefalin injection, our lead product candidate. Pursuant to the Product Agreements, Patheon and Patheon Greenville will manufacture commercial supplies of difelikefalin injection at the Monza, Italy and Greenville, North Carolina manufacturing sites, respectively, from API supplied by us. Patheon and Patheon Greenville will be responsible for supplying the other required raw materials and packaging components, and will also provide supportive manufacturing services such as quality control testing for raw materials, packaging components and finished product.
Sales and Marketing
In executing our strategy, our goal is to commercialize KORSUVA injection and Kapruvia in the dialysis setting by partnering with out-licensing agreements, and to maintain significant control over the development process and commercial execution for the oral formulation of difelikefalin, if approved.
We have executed out-licensing agreements on KORSUVA injection and Kapruvia in the dialysis setting in the United States and the rest of the world. Per the terms of the associated licensing agreements, CSL Vifor will commercialize KORSUVA injection and Kapruvia, and we will not be incurring costs for commercializing in the United States or outside of the United States as we will be relying on sales and marketing infrastructure support from our partner.
For oral difelikefalin, we plan to develop and commercialize our drug candidate in pruritus indications, such as NDD-CKD, AD, and NP, on our own in the United States, while exploring partnerships for development and commercialization in geographical territories outside the United States.

Intellectual Property
We strive to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patent protection intended to cover the composition of matter of our product candidates, their methods of use, related technology and other inventions that are important to our business. As more fully described below, patent applications have been filed covering compositions and novel formulations of these compositions, as well as methods of using difelikefalin. We own the patent portfolio of eighteen issued U.S. patents covering KOR agonists, sixteen of which cover composition of matter of difelikefalin and its uses; six of these include composition of matter claims directed to difelikefalin, and ten patents include claims to its uses. All of these U.S. patents covering difelikefalin and its uses are expected to expire no earlier than November 12, 2027. Additionally, three U.S. patents have been granted with claims to difelikefalin-like dimer compounds and their uses. We have filed patent applications in the United States and internationally claiming novel oral formulations of difelikefalin. One U.S. patent with claims to oral formulations of difelikefalin has been granted and is expected to expire no earlier than September 13, 2039. Related U.S. and foreign applications, if granted, would also be expected to expire no earlier than September 13, 2039. We have also filed U.S. and foreign patent applications for additional formulations of difelikefalin, which if granted, would be expected to expire no earlier than March 18, 2040. We also rely on trade secrets and careful monitoring of our proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the field of peripheral analgesia and treatment of pruritus.
A third party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights, which are important or necessary to the development of our products. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize our products, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from these third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or our business could be harmed, possibly materially. If we were not able to obtain a license or were not able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be harmed, possibly materially.
We plan to continue to expand our intellectual property estate by filing patent applications directed to novel formulations and novel uses of our proprietary compounds. We anticipate seeking patent protection in the United States and internationally for the chemistries and processes for manufacturing these novel formulations and uses of these compounds in a variety of therapies.
The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and the patent’s scope can be modified after issuance by later judicial decisions. Consequently, we do not know whether any of our product candidates will be adequately protectable or remain protected by enforceable patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties.
Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for up to 18 months, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of our entitlement to the inventions covered by pending patent applications. Moreover, although unlikely, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, to determine priority of invention, or in post-grant challenge proceedings in the USPTO, or a foreign patent office such as oppositions, inter-partes review, post grant review, or a derivation proceeding, that challenge our entitlement to an invention or the patentability of one or more claims in our patent applications or issued patents. Such proceedings could result in substantial cost, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us.

The patent portfolios for our most advanced programs are summarized below.
Difelikefalin
Our synthetic peptide amide kappa opioid agonist patent portfolio is wholly owned by us. The portfolio includes eighteen issued U.S. patents (U.S. Patent Nos. 7,402,564; 7,713,937; 7,727,963; 7,842,662; 8,217,007; 8,236,766; 8,486,894; 8,536,131; 8,906,859; 8,951,970; 9,321,810; 9,334,305; 9,359,399; 10,017,536; 10,138,270; 10,793,596; 10,913,769 and 11,033,629) with claims to compositions of a wide range of synthetic peptide amide kappa opioid agonists, including difelikefalin and related molecules, as well as formulations containing and methods of using these compounds. These patents claiming difelikefalin compositions are due to expire November 12, 2027. U.S. Patent No. 11,033,629 with claims to oral formulations of difelikefalin is due to expire September 13, 2039.
We have listed twelve of the patents claiming difelikefalin acetate and/or its uses in the Orange Book, a listing of patents relating to approved drug products maintained by the FDA. Difelikefalin acetate has been awarded a five-year data exclusivity from the approval date, i.e. until August 23, 2026, prohibiting the FDA from accepting an application for approval of a difelikefalin product from a generic manufacturer until after the exclusivity period expires. In addition, we have also submitted an application for a patent term extension of one of our difelikefalin U.S. patents, which if granted for the additional full five-year extension requested, would extend the patent term to November 12, 2032.
Foreign applications relating to difelikefalin and related molecules, as well as formulations containing and methods of using these compounds, were filed in more than 40 foreign countries. National patents have been granted in 27 European countries, as well as in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Russian Federation, Singapore, South Africa and South Korea. These granted foreign patents with claims to difelikefalin are due expire no earlier than November 12, 2027. 
We also own pending U.S. continuation and foreign patent applications with claims to oral formulations containing difelikefalin and medium chain fatty acid glycerides as absorption enhancers in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Japan, Hong Kong, Israel, India, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, Russian Federation, Saudi Arabi, UAE, and South Africa. If granted, these patents would expire no earlier than September 13, 2029.
In addition, we own pending U.S. and foreign patent applications with claims to oral formulations containing difelikefalin and oligosaccharides in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Japan, Hong Kong, Israel, India, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, Russian Federation, Saudi Arabi, UAE, and South Africa. If granted, these patents would expire no earlier than March 18, 2041.
Other Cara Patents and Patent Applications
We also own several other U.S. patents including U.S. Patent Nos. 7,741,350; 7,960,376; 7,960,377; and 8,211,926 with claims to other cannabinoid compounds and U.S. Patent No. 8,217,000 with claims to regulation of prolactin in mammals including humans.
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a PCT application or a non-provisional patent application. The term of a patent in the United States can be adjusted and extended due to the failure of the USPTO following certain statutory and regulation deadlines for progressing prosecution and issuing a patent.
In the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for a portion of the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are 

22



​

available in Europe and other non-United States jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our pharmaceutical products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. Although we intend to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions.
Cara Trademark Applications and registrations
We rely on our U.S. and foreign trademarks for authentication of our current and future products and for protection against counterfeits. In the United States, trademarks may be reserved under an “Intent to Use” designation but may only be registered upon a showing of actual use in the stream of commerce. Many countries permit registration without such a showing of actual use. However, such registrations become vulnerable to cancellation after a designated period of non-use. For example, a trademark registered in EU States may be cancelled for non-use after five years from the date of registration. Trademark registrations can in principle last for as long as the owner uses the trademark and pays the maintenance fees due at regular intervals (every ten years in most jurisdictions after complying with filing requirements for confirmations of use and paying the designated fees during the first ten years from the registration date).
We own the registered trademark “KORSUVA” in the United States and in twelve foreign countries (Australia, Brazil, Canada, Israel, Japan, Kuwait, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, South Korea, Switzerland, and the UK). In addition, we own three Japanese trademark applications for Katakana versions of “KORSUVA” as may be pronounced in the Japanese language: “KORSUVA” Katakana version 1: “ko-ru-su-ba” コルスバ; Katakana version 2: “ko-ru-su-o-ba” コルスーバ; and Katakana version 3 “ko-o-su-ba” コースバ. Our trademark applications for “KORSUVA” are pending in China and India.
Additionally, we own the U.S. trademark application for “KAPRUVIA” currently pending under an “Intent to Use” designation, as well as the “KAPRUVIA” trademark registered in all twenty-seven EU States (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden) and fourteen additional countries: Albania, Australia, China, Iceland, Israel, Monaco, New Zealand, North Macedonia, Norway, Russian Federation, Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey and the UK.
We have applied for registration of the trademark “OPRUITY” in the United States (which is currently pending under an Intent to Use designation) and in twenty other countries and regions: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, EU, India, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, South Africa, Switzerland, UAE and the UK. 
We also own the U.S. trademark application for “XAYLIANT” currently pending under an “Intent to Use” designation for use in future product(s) yet to be developed.
We rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to adequately protect our trade secrets to prevent harm to our business. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to our current or planned business or research and development, or R&D, or made during normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information, are our exclusive property.

Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, and medical technology companies. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
There are a large number of companies developing or marketing therapies for some of the indications that we are pursuing. Many of our competitors, including many of the organizations named below, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of competitors. Small or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaboration arrangements with large and established companies. We also compete with these companies in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials.
We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates, if approved for marketing, are likely to be their safety, efficacy and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement from government and third-party payers. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payers seeking to encourage the use of generic products. Generic products currently on the market are often tried off-label for the indications that we are pursuing, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If our product candidates achieve marketing approval, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over generic products.
If our product candidates are approved for the indications for which we are currently undertaking clinical trials, they will compete with the therapies and currently marketed drugs discussed below:
KORSUVA injection - CKD-aP. Currently, there are no approved products for management of CKD-aP in the United States and Europe. However, there are many products that are used to help manage CKD-aP. The most common of these agents are anti-itch creams and emollients as well as oral or injectable antihistamines. All of these products have limited degrees of efficacy and are available generically. Additionally, patients may try several other agents such as gabapentin or naltrexone, generally with limited success or therapies such as UVB light therapy with limited availability.
Because of the substantial unmet need for products that are safe and effective in CKD-aP, there are other companies that either were in the past or are currently involved in the discovery, development, and/or marketing of such products for CKD-aP or related conditions. Some of such product candidates or products include nemolizumab from Galderma, nalbuphine from Trevi Therapeutics and Remitch® or nalfurafine from Toray Industries.
Oral difelikefalin – NDD-CKD. There are no FDA-approved treatment options specifically for this indication in the United States and worldwide. Patients are generally managed with a multitude of products including corticosteroids, gabapentin, antihistamines, antidepressants, and other therapies with varying degrees of success. There is one product, nalfurafine (Remitch®) marketed by Toray Industries, approved to treat CKD-aP in Japan, but only in dialysis patients. It is not approved in either the United States or Europe for any indication.
Oral difelikefalin – AD Associated Pruritus. We are developing oral difelikefalin for the management of moderate-to-severe chronic pruritus associated with AD. There are currently several products specifically approved in 

24



​

the United States to treat AD and the itching associated with it: Dupixent (dupilumab), Eucrisa (crisaborole), Opzelura (ruxolitinib), Adbry (tralokinumab-ldrm), Rinvoq (upadacitinib) and Cibinqo (abrocitinib). Additionally, the market for the management of mild-to-moderate and moderate-to-severe AD includes numerous generic products, including topical and oral formulations of corticosteroids and antihistamines. Because of the size and untapped potential of the AD market, there are other companies involved in the discovery, development, and/or marketing of new products for pruritus. Multiple companies are studying IL-13 inhibitors (e.g. lebrikizumab), IL-31 inhibitors (e.g. nemolizumab), JAK inhibitors (e.g. baricitinib) and OX40 inhibitors for treatment of AD. 
​
Oral difelikefalin – NP Associated Pruritus. There are no FDA-approved treatments for pruritus associated with NP. The management of NP is challenging and conventional treatments for pruritus, such as antihistamines and topical steroids, are largely ineffective.
Manufacturing
We do not have any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture for KORSUVA injection and if our product candidates receive marketing approval. We have negotiated long-term commitments with at least one primary supplier for our primary manufacturing and distribution functions. We have entered into a commercial manufacturing agreement with Patheon for KORSUVA injection, a commercial supply agreement with PPL to produce API, and a commercial packaging agreement with PCI Pharma Services.
All of our product candidates are either small peptides or organic small molecules and are manufactured in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes from readily available starting materials. The chemistry is amenable to scale up and does not require any special equipment or technology in the manufacturing process. We expect to continue to develop product candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export of pharmaceutical products such as KORSUVA injection. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
FDA Regulation
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

● | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

25



​


● | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of human clinical trials, including adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, in accordance with good clinical practices, or cGCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity, as well as satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of selected clinical sites to determine cGCP compliance; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of drug substance chemistry, toxicity and drug product formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Manufacture of drug substance, drug product and the labeling and distribution of clinical supplies must all comply with cGMP standards. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with cGCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined. In Phase 1, the drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an initial indication of its effectiveness. In Phase 2, the drug typically is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. In Phase 3, the drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully 

26



​

within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Marketing Approval. Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals regarding the timing of its review of an application.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks and ensure safe use of the drug. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an external advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured, referred to as a Pre-Approval Inspection. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with cGCP.
The testing and approval process for an NDA requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval of an NDA on a timely basis, or at all.
After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific 

27



​

conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA may issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, including a boxed warning, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Breakthrough Therapy Designation. The FDA may expedite the review of a product candidate designated as a breakthrough therapy, which is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. A sponsor may request the FDA to designate a drug as a breakthrough therapy at the time of, or any time after, the submission of an IND application for the drug. If the FDA designates a drug as a breakthrough therapy, it must take actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application, which may include holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the drug; providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable; involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor; and taking steps to ensure that the design of the clinical trials is as efficient as practicable, when scientifically appropriate, such as by minimizing the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment. The FDA may rescind a Breakthrough Therapy designation in the future if further clinical development later shows that the criteria for designation are no longer met. Breakthrough Therapy designation does not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or review process.
Post-Approval Requirements. Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, and compliance with any post-approval requirements imposed as a condition of approval, such as Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to assess safety and effectiveness after commercialization. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program user fee requirements for any marketed products, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market.

28



​

Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Although physicians, in the practice of medicine, may prescribe approved drugs for unapproved indications, pharmaceutical companies are required to promote their drug products only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. However, physicians may, in their independent medical judgment, prescribe legally available products for off-label uses. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments but the FDA does restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. 
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
Fraud and Abuse, Data Privacy and Security and Transparency Laws and Regulations
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state health care regulatory laws restrict business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. These laws include, among other things, anti-kickback and false claims laws and regulations, physician payment transparency laws and regulations, as well as data privacy and security laws and regulations.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances.

​

Additionally, the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “Health Care Reform Law”), to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Health Care Reform Law provided that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
Federal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. The federal civil False Claims Act has been used to assert liability on the basis of kickbacks and other improper referrals, improperly reported government pricing metrics such as Best Price or Average Manufacturer Price, improper use of Medicare provider or supplier numbers when detailing a provider of services, improper promotion of off-label uses not expressly approved by FDA in a drug’s label, and allegations as to misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered. Additionally, the civil monetary penalties statute, which, among other things, imposes fines against any person or entity who is determined to have presented, or caused to be presented, claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows, or should know, is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer.
In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final HIPAA Omnibus Rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements on certain types of individuals and entities subject to the law, known as covered entities, such as certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business associates that process individually identifiable health information on their behalf, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information as well as their covered subcontractors. Among other things, HITECH makes security standards and certain privacy standards directly applicable to the business associates of covered entities that perform services for them that involve the creation, use, maintenance or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws may govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Additionally, federal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act created under Section 6002 of the Health Care Reform Law and its implementing regulations, require that manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians (defined to include doctors of medicine, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at their request or designation. Additionally, applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations are required to report annually to CMS certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians (as defined above) and their immediate family members.

​

There are also an increasing number of analogous state laws that require manufacturers to file reports with states on pricing and marketing information, such as tracking and reporting of gifts, compensations, other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and healthcare entities. For example, several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish and implement commercial compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities and/or register their sales representatives. Certain state laws also regulate manufacturers’ use of prescriber-identifiable data. These laws may affect our sales, marketing and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
Coverage and Reimbursement Generally
The commercial success of KORSUVA injection and our ability to commercialize any approved product candidates successfully will depend in part on the extent to which governmental payer programs at the federal and state levels, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payers provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels. In the United States, private health insurers and other third-party payers often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government provides reimbursement through the Medicare or Medicaid programs for such products and services. 
Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payers to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Sales of KORSUVA injection and our product candidates to the extent approved will therefore depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payers. Further, assuming coverage is approved, the resulting reimbursement payment rates might not be adequate. KORSUVA injection is expected to be designated as a component of the government’s bundled reimbursement for ESRD treatment. 
Our U.S. commercial partner, CSL Vifor, submitted the payment reimbursement application for TDAPA and HCPCS to CMS in September 2021. In December 2021, CMS granted TDAPA to KORSUVA injection in the anti-pruritic functional category. TDAPA will apply to KORSUVA injection beginning April 1, 2022 for two years. 
Third-party payers are increasingly imposing additional requirements and restrictions on coverage and limiting reimbursement levels for medical products, including pharmaceuticals. For example, federal and state governments reimburse covered prescription drugs at varying rates generally below average wholesale price. These restrictions and limitations influence the purchase of healthcare services and products. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drug products for a particular indication. Additionally, third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. Therefore, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. KORSUVA injection and

any of our product candidates, to the extent they receive approval, may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. Moreover, a payer’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved, and one payer’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payers will also provide coverage. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development. Legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce costs under government insurance programs may result in lower reimbursement for our products and product candidates or exclusion of our products and product candidates from coverage. The cost containment measures that healthcare payers and providers are instituting and any healthcare reform could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of KORSUVA injection and any approved product candidates.
Healthcare Regulatory Developments
In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, the legislative landscape with respect to healthcare continues to evolve. There have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
For example, the Health Care Reform Law was passed in March 2010 and includes provisions that have substantially changed healthcare financing by both governmental and private insurers. Among other provisions that could have an impact on our business, the Health Care Reform Law revised the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers to the state and federal government for covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for certain branded prescription drugs, and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research. Additionally, the Health Care Reform Law implemented a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program in which manufacturers must now agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the outpatient drugs being covered under Medicare Part D. 
There have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Health Care Reform Law. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or TCJA, included a provision that repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Health Care Reform Law on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the Health Care Reform Law is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Thus, the Health Care Reform Law will remain in effect in its current form. Prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the Health Care Reform Law marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the Health Care Reform Law. In addition, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in Health Care Reform Law marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the “donut hole” under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and creating a new manufacturer discount program. It is possible that the Health Care Reform Law will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the Health Care Reform Law and our business.

​

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Health Care Reform Law was enacted. In August 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year starting in 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect until 2031, except for a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Additionally, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. Congress is considering additional health reform measures. 
In the United States, the EU, and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third-party payers are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which often has resulted in average selling prices lower than they would otherwise be. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the EU will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and utilization, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. For example, there have been several recent U.S. Presidential executive orders, Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. No legislation or administrative actions have been finalized to implement these principles. It is unclear whether these or similar policy initiatives will be implemented in the future. In addition, the IRA, among other things, (1) directs HHS to negotiate the price of certain single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and (2) imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. It is currently unclear how the IRA will be implemented but is likely to have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry. Further, the Biden administration released an additional executive order on October 14, 2022, directing HHS to submit a report on how the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation can be further leveraged to test new models for lowering drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. It is unclear whether these this executive order or similar policy initiatives will be implemented in the future. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical coverage and reimbursement policies and pricing in general.
These and other healthcare reform initiatives may result in additional reductions in Medicare payments and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial operations. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could further limit the prices we are able to charge, or the amounts of reimbursement available, for KORSUVA injection and our product candidates once

they are approved. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Foreign Regulation
In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. For example, in the EU, we must obtain authorization of a clinical trial application, or CTA, in each member state in which we intend to conduct a clinical trial. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
Employees and Human Capital
As of March 2, 2023, we had 106 employees, of whom 32 hold PharmD, PhD or MD degrees or the foreign equivalent. All of these employees are located in the United States. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing, and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors, and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
