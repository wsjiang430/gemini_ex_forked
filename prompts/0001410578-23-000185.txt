ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
We are a biotechnology company focused on developing personalized immune therapies for cancer. We have developed a platform technology, DCVax®, which uses activated dendritic cells to mobilize a patient’s own immune system to attack their cancer.
Our lead product, DCVax®-L, is designed to treat solid tumor cancers in which the tumor can be surgically removed. We have completed a 331-patient international Phase III trial of DCVax-L for Glioblastoma multiforme brain cancer (GBM). We plan to conduct clinical trials of DCVax-L for other solid tumor cancers in the future, when resources permit. Our second product, DCVax®-Direct, is designed to treat inoperable solid tumors. A 40-patient Phase I trial has been completed, and included treatment of a diverse range of more than a dozen types of cancers. We plan to work on preparations for Phase II trials of DCVax-Direct as resources permit.
On May 10, 2022, top line data from the Phase III trial of DCVax-L were presented in a scientific conference at the New York Academy of Sciences by one of the investigators in the trial. The presentation was made available publicly on a third-party site. On November 17, 2022, the Phase III trial results were reported in a peer reviewed publication in JAMA Oncology, a top scientific and medical journal.
The Company is now working on preparations for an application for regulatory approval of DCVax-L. The Company is working with teams of specialized consultants on pre-requisites for the application, and on portions of the application package itself. One of the pre-requisites — obtaining regulatory approval of a Pediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) — was completed during 2022 on an accelerated basis, including regulatory approval to use the same trial design with external controls as was used in the Company’s Phase 3 trial. Additionally, substantial progress was made with the contract research organization (CRO) and specialized consultants on preparing the Trial Master File to be inspection-ready for regulators.
Post-COVID difficulties continue to impact the Company’s programs and operations, due to backlogs in the supply chain, at clinical trial sites, and at regulators. The supply chain backlogs include service firms and also vendors and suppliers of a wide variety of items, ranging from major equipment to particular reagents required for the manufacturing process. Shortages of certain key materials and supplies have also occurred. The clinical trial site backlogs involve delays for various clinical trial follow-up matters, such as queries and additional documentation. With regulators, committee processes and regulatory processes were focused on COVID matters during the pandemic, and a substantial backlog of non-COVID matters accumulated. The Company is hopeful that the various backlog circumstances will improve in 2023.

The DCVax Technology
Our platform technology, DCVax, is a personalized immune therapy that uses a patient’s own dendritic cells, or DCs, the master cells of the immune system, as the therapeutic agent. The patient’s DCs are obtained through a blood draw, or leukapheresis. The DCs are then activated and loaded with biomarkers (“antigens”) from the patient’s own tumor. For DCVax-L, the antigen loading process takes place during the manufacturing of the product. For DCVax-Direct, the antigen loading process takes place in situ in the tumor after the product is directly injected into the patient’s inoperable tumor. The loading of antigens into the DCs “educates” the DCs about what the immune system needs to target.
Manufacturing of DCVax
We use a batch manufacturing technology for our DCVax products, and we believe this manufacturing approach is a key part of the practicality of our product and its economic feasibility. Generally, we are able to produce enough doses for the patient’s treatment regimen through just one manufacturing process. When a batch of DCVax product has been made, we then cryopreserve it.
Both of these technologies -- the personalized batch manufacturing for each patient and the cryopreservation -- are essential elements of our manufacturing model and product economics. Together, they enable us to usually incur the high costs of manufacturing just one time for each patient, and then store the multi-year or multi-dose quantity of product, frozen, in single doses. This makes DCVax effectively an “off the shelf” product for the patient after the initial manufacturing, even though it is personalized, and we anticipate that this will enable the pricing of DCVax to be in line with other new cancer drugs. We also believe that both economies of scale and automation will further enhance the product economics. The manufacturing process today is also rapid: about eight days for DCVax-L, and seven days for DCVax-Direct, followed by quality control and release testing (including a sterility test that may take a couple of weeks).
As previously reported, we have been developing a manufacturing facility in Sawston, UK. Prior to 2022, our production of dendritic cell vaccine products in the UK was taking place in a GMP (clean room) facility in London, with a capacity of about four to six patients per month. The Sawston facility contains a total of 88,345 square feet on two floors. The initial production capacity comprises two manufacturing suites, occupying approximately 4,400 square feet on the ground floor. These two suites, together with substantial support space for process development, Quality Control testing, quarantined storage, cryostorage and other functions are anticipated to have potential capacity to produce dendritic cell vaccines for up to 40 to 45 patients per month, or approximately 450 to 500 patients annually. The buildout of Phase 1A of the Sawston facility was previously completed, and the buildout of Phase 1B has been under way in 2022 and Q1 of 2023. Our buildout of the Sawston facility is designed to proceed in phases, as modules, both for efficiency in the timing of capital costs and to allow flexibility in operations and usage.
During 2021, initial licenses were obtained for operations in the Sawston facility, after technology transfer from the London facility, recruitment of technical personnel, development of some 1,000 regulatory documents, and buildout of Phase 1A of the facility. The initial licenses included a license from the Human Tissue Authority (HTA) for collection and processing of human cells and tissues, and licenses from the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for manufacturing for clinical trials and compassionate use.
GMP production of DCVax-L products for compassionate use began in the Sawston facility in February 2022, after the licenses were obtained in Q4 2021, and continued throughout 2022. In parallel, extensive activities were conducted throughout 2022 to further develop the operations, personnel, regulatory documents and data necessary to apply for a commercial manufacturing license for the Sawston facility. The application package was submitted at the end of June, and reviewed by the regulatory authorities over the following months. An initial onsite inspection by regulatory authorities took place in October for the commercial license application, and also served as the annual review/renewal inspection for the prior licenses for compassionate use and clinical trial manufacturing. Further submissions and interactions with the regulator took place between October and February, and a follow-up inspection took place in early February 2023. The Company is now awaiting any further requirements or communications from regulators.
In parallel, production of DCVax-L products for compassionate use continued in the London facility. In the US, the Company entered into contract discussions for resumption of manufacturing capacity there.
The Company also continued process and infrastructure improvements that will be needed for scale-up. These include work towards development of a system designed to avoid or reduce bottlenecks in quality control testing and product “release,” and equipping the facility to establish capacity for controlled cryostorage of millions of doses.

The initial production capacity in the Sawston facility occupies only a small fraction of the total space there. In light of this, and in light of our obligation in connection with the buildout loan from the Cambridge development authority to make the Sawston facility benefit the regional business ecosystem and not just us, as previously reported we entered into a sublease on December 31, 2021 for a small portion of the space to our contract manufacturer, Advent BioServices. For further details, please see Note 10 below. It is anticipated that, as and when feasible, the subleased space may enable some production of third party cell therapy products. Such production of other products will fulfill the loan-related commitment to the Cambridge authority, will help support the capital-intensive Sawston facility costs and, in light of the growing demand for cell therapy manufacturing capacity, could substantially increase the asset value of the Sawston facility.
All of the development activities for the Sawston facility, and the manufacturing at the Sawston facility, have been carried out or managed by Advent BioServices, who is the contract operator of the facility.
In parallel with our activities in the Sawston facility, development work on the Flaskworks system continued throughout 2022. As previously reported, the Flaskworks system is designed to close and automate the manufacturing of cell therapy products such as DCVax®. The Flaskworks company was previously owned by its technical founders and Corning Inc, and following our acquisition in 2020 it became a wholly owned subsidiary of our Company. We anticipate that the Flaskworks system will enable substantial scale-up of production volumes of DCVax products and potentially substantial reduction of production costs (including potential reduction of indirect costs related to capital-intensive facility costs). We anticipate that implementation of the Flaskworks system will enable certain phases of the Sawston buildout to be simplified and streamlined. For further details on the financial aspects of the Flaskworks acquisition, please see Item 8 Note 5 below.
Intellectual Property and Orphan Drug Designation
We have an integrated strategy for protection of our technology through both patents and other mechanisms, such as Orphan Drug status. As of December 31, 2022, we have 103 issued patents and 64 pending patent applications worldwide, grouped into 9 patent families. Of these, 98 issued patents and 43 pending patent applications directly relate to our DCVax products. In the United States and Europe, some of our patents and applications relate to compositions and the use of products, while other patents and applications relate to other aspects such as manufacturing. For example, in the United States, we have six issued patents and four pending patent applications that relate to the composition and/or use of our DCVax products. We also have other US patents and applications that cover, among other things, a potential method for determining the immunopotency of our dendritic cells produced by our manufacturing processes and an automated system which we believe will help enable the scale-up of production for large numbers of patients on a cost-effective basis. Similarly, in Europe, we have five patents, validated as 59 national patents, issued by and four pending patent applications with the European Patent Office (“EPO”) that cover our DCVax products, and other patents and applications that cover aspects such as manufacturing, a potential method for determining immunopotency of our manufactured products, and the automated system. In Japan, we have seven issued patents and four pending patent applications relating to our DCVax products, as well as manufacturing related patents. Patents have been granted or are pending in other foreign jurisdictions which may be potential future markets for our DCVax products.
During 2022, four new patents were issued to us as part of our worldwide patent portfolio. The European patent was validated as 16 national patents. The newly issued patents cover methods for manufacturing dendritic cells related to our DCVax products, as well as encompassing certain methods of use and compositions that may be potential future markets for related DCVax products and a potential method for determining the immunopotency of dendritic cells produced by our manufacturing processes.
Additionally, with the acquisition of Flaskworks, we gained ownership of a portfolio of patents and patent applications which include those held by Flaskworks as well as patents and patent applications exclusively licensed by Flaskworks from Northeastern University. The portfolio includes a total of thirteen patent families, with issued patents and pending applications worldwide. Collectively these patents and patent applications cover key aspects of the design and function of automated cell culture systems.
During 2020, three new patents were issued to us as part of our worldwide patent portfolio. The newly issued patents cover methods for manufacturing dendritic cells related to our DCVax products, as well as encompassing certain methods of use and compositions that may be potential future markets for related DCVax products.

The expiration dates of the issued US patents involved in our current business range from 2023 to 2036, and pending applications may involve longer time periods. The expiration dates of the issued European patents involved in our current business range from 2023 to 2036, and pending applications may involve longer time periods. For some of the earlier dates, we plan to seek extensions of the patent life, and believe we have reasonable grounds for doing so.
In addition to our patent portfolio, we have obtained Orphan Drug designation for our lead product, DCVax-L for glioma brain cancers. Such designation brings with it a variety of benefits, including potential market exclusivity for seven years in the US and ten years in Europe if our product is the first of its type to reach the market.
This market exclusivity applies regardless of patents (i.e., even if the company that developed it has no patent coverage on the product). In addition, the time period for such market exclusivity does not begin to run until product sales begin. In contrast, the time period of a patent begins when the patent is filed and runs down during the years while the product is going through development and clinical trials.
Competition
The biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. A large and growing number of companies are actively involved in the research and development of immune therapies or cell-based therapies for cancer (including Kite, Juno, Sotio, AiVita, Mendus, Medicenna and many others). In addition, many big pharma companies (including BMS, Merck, Pfizer, Astra Zeneca, Roche and others) are rapidly commercializing checkpoint inhibitor drugs to “take the brakes off” patients’ immune responses to cancer. Other novel technologies for cancer are also under development or approved, such as the Optune electro-therapy device developed by NovoCure, various biologics that Medicenna is developing, and various oncolytic virus therapies and gene therapies. Additionally, many companies are actively involved in the research and development of monoclonal antibody-based and bi-specific or tri-specific antibody-based cancer therapies. Currently, a substantial number of antibody-based drugs are approved for commercial sale for cancer therapy, and a large number of additional ones are under development. Many other third parties compete with us in developing alternative therapies to treat cancer, including: biopharmaceutical companies; biotechnology companies; pharmaceutical companies; academic institutions; and other research organizations, as well as some medical device companies.
We face extensive competition from companies developing new treatments for brain cancer. These include a variety of immune therapies, as mentioned above, as well as a variety of small molecule drugs and biologics. There are also a number of existing drugs used for the treatment of brain cancer that may compete with our product, including, Avastin® (Roche Holding AG), Gliadel® (Eisai Co. Ltd.), and Temodar® (Merck & Co., Inc.), as well as the Optune electro-therapy device (Novocure) and oncolytic viruses. Both checkpoint inhibitor drugs and T cell-based therapies are pursuing clinical trials for solid tumors, including brain cancer, as well.
Most of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, pre-clinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing and sales than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly if they enter into collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and collaborators, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our programs, and in obtaining sites for our clinical trials and enrolling patients.
