 Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to the “Company”, “Delcath”, “Delcath Systems”, “we”, “our”, and “us” refers to Delcath Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation, incorporated in August 1988, and all entities included in our consolidated financial statements. Our corporate offices are located at 1633 Broadway, Suite 22C, New York, New York 10019. Our telephone number is (212) 489-2100 and our internet address is www.delcath.com. 
 Company Overview 
 We are an interventional oncology company focused on the treatment of primary and metastatic liver cancers. Our lead product candidate, the HEPZATO® KIT (melphalan hydrochloride for injection/hepatic delivery system), or HEPZATO, is a drug/device combination product designed to administer high-dose chemotherapy to the liver while controlling systemic exposure and associated side effects. In Europe, the hepatic delivery system is a stand-alone medical device having the same device components as the HEPZATO but without the melphalan hydrochloride and is approved for sale under the trade name CHEMOSAT Hepatic Delivery System for Melphalan, or CHEMOSAT, where it has been used at major medical centers to treat a wide range of cancers of the liver. Approximately consisting primarily of metastatic ocular melanoma, or mOM. Approximately 80% of the estimated 800 patients annually with mOM will be eligible for would be candidates for HEPZATO. 
 In the United States, HEPZATO is considered a combination drug and device product and is regulated as a drug by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA. Primary jurisdiction for regulation of HEPZATO has been assigned to the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. The FDA has granted Delcath six orphan drug designations (five for melphalan the treatment of patients with ocular (uveal) melanoma cutaneous melanoma, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and neuroendocrine tumor indications and one for doxorubicin in the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma). HEPZATO has not been approved for sale in the United States. 
 Our clinical development program for HEPZATO is comprised of the FOCUS Clinical Trial for Patients with Hepatic Dominant Ocular Melanoma (the “FOCUS Trial”), a global registration clinical trial that is investigating objective response rate in metastatic ocular melanoma, or mOM, a type of primary liver cancer. Our most advanced development program is the treatment of mOM. We are currently reviewing the incidence, unmet need, available efficacy data and development requirements for a broad set of liver cancers in order to select a portfolio of follow-on indications that will maximize the value of the HEPZATO platform. In addition to HEPZATO’s use to treat mOM, we believe that HEPZATO has the potential to treat other liver dominant cancers, such as Metastatic Colorectal Cancer and Cholangiocarcinoma, and plan to begin the study of HEPZATO to treat such conditions in the near future. We believe that the disease states we are investigating and intend to investigate are unmet medical needs that represent significant market opportunities. 
 In December 2021, the Company announced that the FOCUS Trial for HEPZATO met its pre-specified endpoint. 
 On February 14, 2023, the Company completed a NDA resubmission to the FDA for the HEPZATO Kit (melphalan hydrochloride for Injection/Hepatic Delivery System) seeking approval of the HEPZATO Kit in the treatment of patients with unresectable hepatic-dominant mOM. The resubmission is in response to a September 12, 2013 Complete Response Letter, or CRL, from the FDA for the Company’s NDA in December 2010 seeking approval of its first generation melphalan hydrochloride for injection/hepatic delivery system. The NDA resubmission contains comprehensive data and information on Generation Two HEPZATO Kit relating to the matters identified in the CRL. On March 20, 2023, the FDA determined the resubmission constituted a complete response and set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act target action date of August 14, 2023. We continue to have early access programs in the United States to make HEPZATO available to mOM patients. We are focused on continuing to treat these patients with mOM as regulatory approval is sought in the United States.

 On February 28, 2022, CHEMOSAT received Medical Device Regulation (MDR) certification under the European Medical Devices Regulation [2017/745/EU], which may be considered by jurisdictions when evaluating reimbursement. As of March 1, 2022, we have assumed direct responsibility for sales, marketing and distribution of CHEMOSAT in Europe. 
 Cancers in the Liver—A Significant Unmet Need 
 According to the American Cancer Society’s, or ACS, Cancer Facts & Figures 2023 report, cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, with an estimated 609,820 deaths and over 1.9 million new cases expected to be diagnosed in 2023. Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, accounting for approximately 10 million deaths and 19.3 million new cases in 2020 according to GLOBOCAN, the database of the International Association of Cancer Registries. The financial burden of cancer is enormous for patients, their families and society. The Agency for Healthcare Quality and Research estimates that the direct medical costs (total of all healthcare expenditures) for cancer in the United States in 2018 was $112.5 billion. The liver is often the life-limiting organ for cancer patients and cancer that spreads to the liver is one of the leading causes of cancer death. Cancer that begins in one area of the body often metastasizes to the liver. Patient prognosis is generally poor once cancer has spread to the liver. Consequently, cancers of the liver remain a major unmet medical need globally. 
 Liver Cancers—Incidence and Mortality 
 Cancers of the liver consist of primary liver cancer and metastatic liver cancer. Primary liver cancers (hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC, and Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma or ICC) originates in the liver or biliary tissue and is particularly prevalent in populations where the primary risk factors for the disease, such as hepatitis-B, hepatitis-C, high levels of alcohol consumption, aflatoxin, cigarette smoking and exposure to industrial pollutants, are present. Metastatic liver cancer, also called liver metastasis, or secondary liver cancer, results from the spread or “metastases” of a primary cancer into the liver. These metastases often continue to grow even after the primary cancer in another part of the body has been removed. Given the vital biological functions of the liver, including processing nutrients from food and filtering toxins from the blood, it is not uncommon for metastases to settle in the liver. In many cases patients die not as a result of their primary cancer, but from the tumors that metastasize to their liver. In the United States, metastatic liver disease is more prevalent than primary liver cancer. In Europe and the United States, there are over 200,000 primary and metastatic liver tumors per year. It is estimated the total addressable market in the United States for mOM, ICC, HCC breast cancer, neuroendocrine, pancreatic, and colorectal, is over $1.0 billion. 
 The liver is a difficult organ to treat for certain cancers. Current liver treatment options include surgery, systemic drugs, and minimally invasive or liver directed options. Surgery options include surgical resections, liver transplants, and isolated hepatic perfusion, or IHP. We believe that IHP results in mOM provided rational for PHP in mOM, as well as other tumor types, including colorectal cancer. Systemic options include systemic chemotherapy, immunotherapy agents including KIMMTRAK. Minimally invasive options include external beam radiation therapy and liver directed procedures. Procedures in the liver, liver directed (interventional oncology) are performed by an interventional radiologist. These procedures include trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE, DEBTACE) and Radioembolization (SIRT, TARE, or Y90). TACE is performing approximately 50,000 to 60,000 treatments per year and Y90 is performing 10,000 to 15,000 treatment per year. We believe that CHEMOSAT and HEPZATO, if approved in the United States, represent an important advancement in regional therapy for liver directed treatment of primary liver cancer and certain other cancers metastatic to the liver and are uniquely positioned to treat the entire liver either as a standalone therapy or as a complement to other therapies. Patients at our early access programs have included first line of stand alone treatment, first line treatment for those intending to receive KIMMTRAK as second line treatment, and as a third line palliative treatment.

 Ocular Melanoma 
 Ocular melanoma frequently metastasizes to the liver. Based on third party research that we commissioned approximately 5,000-6,200 cases of ocular melanoma are diagnosed in the United States and Europe annually, and approximately 50% of these patients will develop metastatic disease. Of metastatic cases of ocular melanoma, approximately 90% of patients develop liver involvement. According to Lane et al., JAMA Ophthalmol. 2018 Sep 1;136(9):981-98, once ocular melanoma has spread to the liver, median overall survival for these patients is up to 12 months. There is no one standard of care for patients with ocular melanoma liver metastases. Based on our research, an estimated 800 patients with ocular melanoma liver metastases in the United States, and 1,200 patients in Europe may be eligible for treatment with HEPZATO annually. Currently 55% of the patients have no approved treatment option and most of those patients are treated with multiple lines of therapy. We estimate the annual addressable market for this indication in the United States and Europe is approximately $500 million per year. 
Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma 
 Primary liver cancers include HCC and ICC. According to GLOBOCAN 2020, an estimated 68,500 new cases of primary liver cancer are diagnosed in the United States and Europe annually. According to the ACS, approximately 41,260 new cases of these cancers are expected to be diagnosed in the United States, leading to approximately 30,520 deaths. 
 ICC is the second most common form of primary liver cancer and according to Wang et al., 2013 J Clin Oncol 31:1188-1195 accounts for 5-30% of primary liver cancers diagnosed in the United States and Europe annually. We believe that 80% of ICC patients are not candidates for surgical resection, and that approximately 20-30% of these may be candidates for certain focal interventions. According to third party research that we commissioned, we estimate that approximately 11,000 ICC patients in the United States, the United Kingdom and the EU annually could be candidates for treatment with HEPZATO and CHEMOSAT. 
Colorectal Cancer 
 Colorectal cancer or CRC is one of the most prevalent cancers in the United States and Europe and has a high metastatic rate to the liver. GLOBOCAN 2020 estimates 288,230 colorectal cancer diagnosis per year in the United States and Europe. According to the American Cancer Society, in the United States approximately 151,030 diagnoses leading to 52,580 deaths. 
 Recent advances in the treatment of primary colorectal cancer have shown encouraging increases in 5-year survival; however, the presence of metastasis is an indicator for increased mortality probability. Approximately 25% of patients will present with liver metastasis at the time of initial primary disease diagnosis. Clark et al.,
 J Gastrointest Oncol. 2014;5(5):374-387. We estimate approximately 98,000 CRC patients in the United States, the United Kingdom and the EU annually could be candidates for treatment with HEPZATO and CHEMOSAT. 
 Breast Cancer 
 Breast cancer or BC is the most diagnosed cancer in women in the United States and worldwide. The American Cancer Society estimates that 287,850 women will be diagnosed with BC in the United States annually. BC is the second leading cancer-related cause of death for women (behind lung cancer) in the United States. GLOBOCAN 2020 estimates are that there are, annually, 726,259 women diagnosed with breast cancer in the United States, Western Europe and the United Kingdom. Recent advances in primary breast cancer treatments have given patients a high 5-year survival rate. The prognosis for patients with breast cancer liver metastasis, however, remains poor. 
 Approximately 18% of all women diagnosed with breast cancer will also have distant metastatic disease, in which 5% of these patients will have liver only metastasis. Eventually 50% of all metastatic patients will see 
 
6 


  their disease progress to the liver in addition to their initial diagnosed metastatic site and in 20% of these patient’s liver progression is the cause of mortality. Deipolyi AR, et al.J Vasc Inter Radiol. 2018;29(9):1226-1235. Treatment options for patients with multiple sites of metastatic disease vary. We estimate that approximately 6,000 breast cancer patients with hepatic only involvement in the United States and Western Europe (including the United Kingdom and Italy) could be candidates for treatment with HEPZATO and CHEMOSAT. An additional 10,000 patients could receive benefits from HEPZATO and CHEMOSAT in the palliative setting based on local treatment guidelines. 
 Neuroendocrine Cancer 
 Neuroendocrine Tumors or NETs or neuroendocrine neoplasia are a rare group of cancers that originate in neuroendocrine cells. NETs can originate anywhere in the body, the most common sites include the digestive tract, rectum, lungs, pancreas, or appendix. The American Society of Clinical Oncology estimates that there are 12,000 new diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumors each year in the United States, and a total of 21,500 in the United States and Europe. 
 According to Pape et al. 2008. Endocrine-Related Cancer. 15(4), 1083-1097 NETs have a metastasis rate of between 60-80% and the majority of these accrue in the liver (85%). We estimate that approximately 12,000 NETs patients in the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union each year could be candidates for treatment with HEPZATO and CHEMOSAT. 
 Pancreatic Cancer 
 Pancreatic adenocarcinoma comes with a poor prognosis for those diagnosed with the disease. The American Cancer Society estimates that pancreatic cancer will affect 62,210 patients annually, with 49,830 annual deaths in the United States. Along with GLOBOCAN estimates for Western Europe, pancreatic cancer effects a total of 132,442 patients annually with 105,638 annual deaths. 
 Upon diagnosis, nearly 75% of patients will have liver metastasis and 58% of those patients will have liver only metastasis. Metastatic pancreatic cancer proves to be a fast-progressing cancer that, once metastasized, leaves the patient with limited treatment options. Oweira, et al. World J Gastroenterol. 2017;23(10):1872-1880. We estimate there are approximately 57,600 United States and Western Europe new pancreatic cancer patients each year with hepatic only involvement. Given the rapid progression of the disease it is unknown at this time the estimated number of candidates for treatment with HEPZATO and CHEMOSAT. 
 About CHEMOSAT and HEPZATO 
 Our product candidate, the HEPZATO Kit, is a drug/device combination product designed to administer concentrated regional chemotherapy to the liver while controlling systemic exposure and associated side effects. This “whole organ” therapy is performed by isolating the circulatory system of the liver, infusing the liver with a chemotherapeutic agent, and then filtering the blood prior to returning it to the patient’s circulatory system. During the procedure, known as percutaneous hepatic perfusion, PHP®, or PHP therapy, three catheters are placed percutaneously through standard interventional radiology techniques. The catheters temporarily isolate the liver from the body’s circulatory system, allow administration of the chemotherapeutic agent melphalan hydrochloride directly to the liver, and collect blood exiting the liver for filtration by our proprietary filters. The filters adsorb chemotherapeutic agent from the blood, before the filtered blood is returned to the patient’s circulatory system thereby reducing systemic exposure to the drug and related toxic side effects. 
 PHP therapy is performed in an interventional radiology suite in approximately two to three hours. Patients remain in an intensive care or step-down unit overnight for observation following the procedure. Treatment with CHEMOSAT and HEPZATO is repeatable, and a new disposable system is used for each treatment. Patients treated in clinical settings are permitted up to six treatments. In commercial treatment settings, patients have received up to eight treatments. If approved, we expect that the HEPZATO Kit will be appropriate for the 
 
7 


  approved indication, regardless of HLA-A *02:01 status. In the United States, melphalan hydrochloride for injection will be included as part of the system, if approved. In Europe, the system is sold separately and used in conjunction with melphalan hydrochloride commercially available from a third party. In our clinical trials, melphalan hydrochloride for injection is provided to both European and United States clinical trial sites. 
 Early development of HEPZATO System—FDA Complete Response Letter 
 Based on clinical trials conducted using an earlier version of our HEPZATO system, in August 2012, we submitted an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, seeking FDA approval for use of our HEPZATO system for the percutaneous intra-arterial administration of melphalan hydrochloride for use in the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma in the liver and, subsequently, amended the NDA to include ocular melanoma metastatic to the liver. 
 In the Spring of 2013, an Oncologic Drug Advisory Committee, or ODAC panel, convened by the FDA voted 16 to 0, with no abstentions, that the benefits of treatment with the early version of HEPZATO did not outweigh the risks associated with the procedure. A significant portion of the FDA’s presentation to the ODAC panel was focused on the FDA’s assessment of treatment-related risks, including the analysis of treatment-related deaths that occurred during clinical trials. The FDA also expressed concerns about hypotension, or low blood pressure, during the procedure, length of hospital stay, as well as risks of stroke, heart attack, renal failure, and bone marrow suppression. 
 In September 2013, the FDA issued a CRL, relating to our NDA. The FDA issues a CRL after the review of an NDA has been completed and questions remain that preclude approval of the NDA in its current form. The deficiencies identified in the CRL included, among other items, the requirement that we conduct an adequate and well-controlled study demonstrating substantial evidence that the effectiveness of the use of this early version HEPZATO system the Company intended to market outweighed its risks. The CRL also required that we address certain clinical, clinical pharmacology, human factors and product quality elements. 
 In January 2016, we entered into a Special Protocol Assessment agreement, or SPA, with the FDA on the design of a new Phase 3 clinical trial of HEPZATO to treat patients with hepatic dominant ocular melanoma. This SPA represented an agreement with the FDA that a specific Phase 3 trial would adequately address objectives that, if met, would support the submission for regulatory approval of HEPZATO. The SPA’s primary endpoint was overall survival, and secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, overall response rate and quality-of-life measures. However, the Company faced significant difficulties, including the fact that the BAC arm was known to have limited efficacy, enrolling patients into the study under the SPA. Therefore, in the summer of 2018, we amended the protocol for the trial to a non-randomized, single-arm study with a different primary endpoint (objective response rate), which terminated the SPA. 
 Clinical Development Program 
 The focus of our clinical development program is to generate clinical data for CHEMOSAT and HEPZATO in various disease states to demonstrate efficacy and validate the safety profile of the current version of the product and treatment procedure. We believe that the improvements we have made to CHEMOSAT, HEPZATO and the PHP therapy have addressed the adverse event profile and procedure-related risks that led to the issuance of the CRL. Our clinical development program is also designed to support clinical adoption of and reimbursement for CHEMOSAT in Europe, and to support regulatory filings and reimbursement in various jurisdictions, including the United States. 
The FOCUS Trial 
 The FOCUS Trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of treatment with the HEPZATO Kit for patients with mOM. The primary endpoint of ORR was assessed by an Independent Review Committee per RECIST v1.1. Per protocol, patients were treated every 6 to 8 weeks for a maximum of 6 cycles. Tumor responses were assessed every 12 weeks (+/- 2 weeks) until disease progression.

 Delcath powered the single arm trial to demonstrate a clinically meaningful ORR versus checkpoint inhibitors, one of the few mOM treatment categories with a significant amount of peer reviewed publications. Based on this analysis the 95% Confidence Interval for ORR for checkpoint inhibitors was calculated to be 3.6% - 8.3%. The lower bound at the 95% confidence for ORR for HEPZATO Kit needed to exceed 8.3% to demonstrate a clinically meaningful ORR. While this comparator is not an historical control, the FDA did not object to using the meta-analysis of checkpoint inhibitors to provide support for a clinically meaningful ORR. 
 The FOCUS Trial’s intent-to-treat or ITT population was comprised of a total of 102 mOM subjects and the treated population, which the FDA defined as the primary analysis population, was comprised of 91 patients. Of the 91 patients in the treated population, 51 (56.0%) had no prior therapy for liver metastases and 40 (44.0%) had at least one line of prior therapy. An independent Review Committee assessed response status per RECISTv1.1. Treatment with HEPZATO Kit in the treated population resulted in an ORR of 36.3% [95% CI: 26.44, 47.01] including 7.7% of patients with a complete response or CR. The median duration of response was 14.00 months [95% CI: 8.31, 17.74] and the disease control rate or DCR was 73.6% [95% CI: 63.35, 82.31]. The NDA resubmission included updated estimated median overall survival or OS of 20.53 months [95% CI: 16.79, 25.26] and updated estimated OS at 1 year of 0.80 [95% CI: 0.70, 0.87]. Data was cut as of December 2, 2022 and Delcath will continue to follow patients until May 2023 (24 months after the last patient’s last treatment). Since the trial started as a randomized trial, supportive analyses comparing against BAC were also conducted. 
 In the FOCUS Trial safety population (95 patients), 39 patients (41.1%) experienced a treatment-related serious adverse event. The most commonly reported treatment-related serious adverse events were thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and febrile neutropenia which were well-manageable. Five percent of patients experienced treatment-related serious cardiac adverse events; in all cases the events resolved with no ongoing complications. 17 (17.9%) patients withdrew due to an adverse event or a serious adverse event, while 12 (12.6%) received a reduced dose due to an adverse event or serious adverse event. There were no treatment-related deaths in the trial. This is consistent with CHEMOSAT, the HDS device component of the HEPZATO Kit, approved in Europe under a CE mark to deliver melphalan to the liver. The safety data submitted in the NDA is consistent with the CHEMOSAT safety data documented in numerous European single-center and multi-center publications. 
 CHOPIN Trial
The Leiden University Medical Center completed a Phase 1b trial (CHOPIN trial) on the use of the Delcath CHEMOSAT® Hepatic Delivery System with Melphalan (CHEMOSAT) in combination with the immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) ipilimumab and nivolumab to treat patients with metastatic uveal melanoma with liver metastases.
 The goal of the CHOPIN trial is to study the safety and potential synergistic effects of systemic ICI therapy ipilimumab plus nivolumab (IPI+NIVO) when combined with Delcath’s proprietary liver-targeted percutaneous hepatic perfusion treatment in metastatic uveal melanoma patients. The just released publication presented updated safety and efficacy results from the Phase 1b portion of the trial which were previously presented in June 2022 at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting. The Phase 1b portion of the trial enrolled seven patients each of which were treated with two courses of PHP (melphalan 3mg/kg, max 220 mg per cycle) combined with four courses IPI+NIVO escalating the dosing from 1mg/kg each IPI+NIVO (cohort 1) to IPI 1mg/kg + NIVO 3mg/kg (cohort 2). As previously reported, the Best Overall Response included 1 complete response, 5 partial responses and 1 stable disease accounting for an Objective Response Rate of 85.7% and a Disease Control Rate of 100%. At the cut-off date of November 15, 2022, the median follow-up was 29.1 months (range 8.9 – 30.2), the median PFS was 29.1 months (95% CI 11.9 – 46.3) and the median duration of response was 27.1 months (range 7.4 – 28.5). All patients are still alive and three of four patients who subsequently experienced PD continued with treatment in the form of repeated melphalan PHP (M-PHP) cycles. 
 The ongoing randomized phase 2 part of the CHOPIN trial comparing M-PHP alone with M-PHP plus IPI/NIVO, which will include another 76 patients (38 per arm), is approximately 50% enrolled and will provide more insight to the efficacy.

 The determination of a safe and effective dose was a primary goal of the Phase 1b portion of the CHOPIN trial. Grade 1/2 adverse events were seen in all patients and 71.4% experienced grade 3/4 toxicities. In this phase 1b dose-escalation study combining M-PHP with IPI/NIVO the safe treatment dose was established at IPI 1mg/kg and NIVO 3mg/kg. The authors did observe low-grade immune-related toxicities and PHP-related hematological toxicities in the treated groups. Hematological toxicity is a common adverse event after M-PHP, affecting approximately three-quarters of patients. All 7 patients in the study experienced grade 1/2 anemia. To prevent severe leukopenia/neutropenia, G-CSF was administered within 48 hours after M-PHP in their treatment center. The phase 2 part of the CHOPIN study will provide more information on both hepatic and systemic toxicity associated with the combination therapy. 
 Market Access and Commercial Clinical Adoption 
 Europe 
 Since launching CHEMOSAT in Europe, there has been over 1,343 commercial treatments and CHEMOSAT is currently available in over 23 European cancer centers. Physicians in Europe have used CHEMOSAT to treat patients with a variety of cancers in the liver, primarily ocular melanoma liver metastases, and other tumor types, including cutaneous melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and liver metastases from colorectal cancer, breast, pancreatic and neuroendocrine. 
 For the period of December 2018 through February 2022, medac GmbH was the Company’s exclusive distributor for CHEMOSAT in Europe and had the exclusive right to market and sell CHEMOSAT in all member states of the European Union, Norway, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. As of March 1, 2022, we have assumed direct responsibility for sales, marketing and distribution of CHEMOSAT in Europe. UK upgraded the status from “Research” to “Special Status”. 
 European Reimbursement 
 A critical driver of utilization growth for CHEMOSAT in Europe is the expansion of reimbursement mechanisms for the procedure in our priority markets. In most European countries, the government provides healthcare and controls reimbursement levels. Since the European Union has no jurisdiction over patient reimbursement or pricing matters in its member states, the methodologies for determining reimbursement rates and the actual rates may vary by country. Reimbursement is administered on a regional and national basis. A medical device is typically reimbursed under a Diagnosis Related Groups, or DRG, as part of a procedure. Prior to obtaining permanent DRG reimbursement codes, in certain jurisdictions, we are actively seeking interim reimbursement from existing mechanisms that include specific interim reimbursement schemes, new technology payment programs as well as existing DRG codes. Currently we have an interim level of reimbursement in Germany. The CE Mark has been affixed to the CHEMOSAT in 23 centers in 4 countries. 
 On February 28, 2022, CHEMOSAT received Medical Device Regulation certification under the European Medical Devices Regulation [2017/745/EU], which may be considered by jurisdictions when evaluating reimbursement. 
 The release of the clinical study report from the FOCUS Trial will create the opportunity to apply for National Level reimbursement in each European country in regard to metastatic ocular melanoma (mOM). These applications must be made by us on a country-by-country basis, with priority placed on markets where CHEMOSAT is currently used. Currently, CHEMOSAT is approved for reimbursement in Germany. The results from the Focus Trial may also support existing reimbursement mechanisms, such as existing in Germany, allowing more hospital centers to secure funding to utilize CHEMOSAT. This increased level of evidence will ultimately support securing full funding for the treatment under DRG codes. 
 Reimbursement applications in priority European markets are handled directly by the Company.

 Government Regulation 
 Our products are subject to extensive and rigorous government regulation by foreign regulatory agencies and the FDA. Foreign regulatory agencies, the FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions impose extensive requirements upon the clinical development, pre-market clearance and approval, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, advertising and promotion, pricing, storage, and distribution of pharmaceutical and medical device products. Failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory agency or FDA requirements may result in warning letters, fines, civil or criminal penalties, suspensions, delays in clinical development, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of a product from the market. 
United States Regulatory Environment 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drug and device products under the FDCA, and its implementing regulations. HEPZATO is subject to regulation as a combination product, which means it is composed of both a drug product and a device product. If marketed individually, each component would be subject to different regulatory pathways and reviewed by different centers within the FDA. A combination product, however, is assigned to a center within the FDA that will have primary jurisdiction over its pre-market review and regulation based on a determination of its primary mode of action, which is the single mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action. In the case of HEPZATO, the primary mode of action is attributable to the drug component of the product, which means that the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research has primary jurisdiction over its pre-market development and review. 
 The process required by the FDA before drug product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
 

• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated periodically, but at least annually;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the NDA for review;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product is produced and tested to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, regulations; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of an NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The development and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 
 The results of preclinical tests (which include laboratory evaluation as well as GLP studies to evaluate toxicity in animals) for a particular product candidate, together with related manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the proposed clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. IND submissions may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate 
 
11 


  submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Further, an independent institutional review board, or IRB, for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center, and it must monitor the study until completed. The FDA, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive good clinical practice regulations and regulations for informed consent and privacy of individually identifiable information. Similar requirements to the United States’ IND are required in the European Union and other jurisdictions in which we may conduct clinical trials. 
Clinical Trials 
For purposes of NDA submission and approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap: 
 

• | Phase 1 Clinical Trials. Studies are initially conducted in a limited population to test the product candidate for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, typically in healthy humans, but in some cases in patients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 Clinical Trials. Studies are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, explore the initial efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to determine dose range or pharmacodynamics. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 Clinical Trials. These are commonly referred to as pivotal studies. When Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dose range of the product is effective and has an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken in large patient populations to further evaluate dosage, provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial centers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4 Clinical Trials. The FDA may approve an NDA for a product candidate but require that the sponsor conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the drug after NDA approval under a post-approval commitment. In addition, a sponsor may decide to conduct additional clinical trials after the FDA has approved an NDA. Post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Sponsors of clinical trials may submit proposals for the design, execution, and analysis for their pivotal trials under a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA. A SPA is an evaluation by the FDA of a protocol with the goal of reaching an agreement that the Phase 3 trial protocol design, clinical endpoints, and statistical analyses are acceptable to support regulatory approval of the drug product candidate with respect to effectiveness for the indication studied. Under a SPA, the FDA agrees to not later alter its position with respect to adequacy of the design, execution or analyses of the clinical trial intended to form the primary basis of an effectiveness claim in an NDA, without the sponsor’s agreement, unless the FDA identifies a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or efficacy of the drug after testing begins. 
 New Drug Applications 
 The results of drug development, preclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA. An NDA must contain extensive chemistry, manufacturing, and control information and be accompanied by a significant user fee, which may be waived in certain circumstances. Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA should review NDAs within ten months of submission or, if the NDA relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, six months from submission. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation, and recommendation as to whether the NDA should be approved. For new oncology products, the FDA will often solicit an opinion from an Oncology Drug Advisory 
 
12 


  Committee, or ODAC, which is a panel of expert authorities knowledgeable in the fields of general oncology, pediatric oncology, hematologic oncology, immunologic oncology, biostatistics, and other related professions. The ODAC panel reviews and evaluates data concerning the safety and effectiveness of marketed and investigational human drug products for use in the treatment of cancer and makes appropriate recommendations to the Commissioner of the FDA. However, the FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee and may deny approval of an NDA by issuing a CRL, if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied. A CRL may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive, and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies, or manufacturing. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than the applicant or its collaborators interpret data. Approval may be contingent on a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, that limits the labeling, distribution, or promotion of a drug product. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance programs to monitor the safety and efficacy of approved products which have been commercialized. The FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs or other information. 
 There are three primary regulatory pathways for a NDA under Section 505 of the FDCA: Section 505 (b)(1), Section 505 (b)(2) and Section 505(j). A Section 505 (b)(1) NDA is used for approval of a new drug (for clinical use) whose active ingredients have not been previously approved. A Section 505 (b)(2) application is used for a new drug that relies on data not developed by the applicant. Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act. This statutory provision permits the approval of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits the applicant to rely, in part, upon the FDA’s findings of safety and effectiveness for previously approved products. A Section 505(j) NDA, also known as an abbreviated NDA, is used for a generic version of a drug that has already been approved. 
 Orphan Drug Exclusivity 
 Some jurisdictions, including the United States, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Pursuant to the U.S. Orphan Drug Act, the FDA grants orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. The orphan designation is granted for a combination of a drug entity and an indication and, therefore, it can be granted for an existing drug with a new (orphan) indication. Applications are made to the FDA’s Office of Orphan Products Development and a decision or request for more information is rendered in 60 days. NDAs for designated orphan drugs are exempt from user fees, obtain additional clinical protocol assistance, are eligible for tax credits for up to 50% of research and development costs, and are granted a seven-year period of exclusivity upon approval. The FDA cannot approve the same drug for the same condition during this period of exclusivity, except in certain circumstances where a new product demonstrates superiority to the original treatment. Exclusivity begins on the date that the marketing application is approved by the FDA for the designated orphan drug, and an orphan designation does not limit the use of that drug in other applications outside the approved designation in either a commercial or investigational setting. 
 We have received five orphan drug designations for melphalan in the following indications: 
 

• | the treatment of patients with cutaneous melanoma;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | the treatment of patients with ocular melanoma;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | the treatment of patients with neuroendocrine tumors;
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | the treatment of patients with primary liver cancer, or HCC; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma, which includes ICC.
--+---------------------------------------------------------

 
13 


 We have received one orphan drug designation for doxorubicin for the treatment of patients with primary liver cancer, or HCC. 
 The granting of orphan drug designations does not mean that the FDA has approved a new drug. Companies seeking new drug approval must still pursue the rigorous development and approval process that requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources. Accordingly, although we have received these orphan drug designations, we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product will be granted at all, or on a timely basis. 
 Other Regulatory Requirements 
 Products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping, annual product quality review and reporting requirements. Adverse event experience with the product must be reported to the FDA in a timely fashion and pharmacovigilance programs to proactively look for these adverse events are mandated by the FDA. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors must register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon drug manufacturers. Following such inspections, the FDA may issue notices on Form 483 and Untitled Letters or Warning Letters that could require the drug manufacturer to modify certain activities. A Form 483 Notice, if issued at the conclusion of an FDA inspection, can list conditions the FDA investigators believe may have violated cGMP or other FDA regulations or guidelines. In addition to Form 483 Notices and Untitled Letters or Warning Letters, failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a drug manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil penalties. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other ongoing FDA regulatory requirements. 
 If Delcath or its present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may require the recall of our product from distribution or may withdraw any potential approvals of an NDA for that product. 
 The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, dissemination of off-label information, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Further, any drug modifications, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, may require a submission to the FDA for its approval of a new or supplemental NDA, which may require the development of additional data or the conduct of additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, and potential civil and criminal penalties. 
 Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those that have been tested by the drug manufacturer and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties, in particular in oncology. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use. 
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Our ability to commercialize any products successfully once approved will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, such as government health administration authorities, private health insurers and managed care organizations. Even if we obtain coverage for a given product by a 
 
14 


  third-party payor, the third-party payor’s reimbursement rates may not be adequate to make the product affordable to patients or profitable to us, or the third-party payors may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Patients who are prescribed medications for the treatment of their conditions, and their prescribing physicians, generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided, and reimbursement is adequate to cover all or a significant portion of the cost of our products. Therefore, coverage and adequate reimbursement is critical to new product acceptance. Coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new drug products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. Additionally, reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors including the third-party payor’s determination that use of a product is: 
 

• | a covered benefit under its health plan;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | safe, effective and medically necessary;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | appropriate for the specific patient;
--+--------------------------------------


• | cost-effective; and
--+--------------------


• | neither experimental nor investigational.
--+------------------------------------------

 Obtaining and maintaining coverage and reimbursement approval for a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost effectiveness data for the use of our products to the payor. Further, no uniform policy requirement for coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors in the United States. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process may require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. 
 In the United States, decisions about reimbursement for new medicines under Medicare are made by CMS, as the administrator for the Medicare program. We anticipate obtaining a J-Code for HEPTAZO, once approved. J-Codes are part of the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System, or HCPCS, code as maintained by CMS. However, there is no guarantee that these billing codes, once granted, or the payment amounts, if any, associated with such codes will not change in the future. Private third-party payors often use CMS as a model for their coverage and reimbursement decisions, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from CMS’s determinations. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for any of our products or product candidates that receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. Government authorities and other third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs, such as by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices as a condition of coverage, are using restrictive formularies and preferred drug lists to leverage greater discounts in competitive classes and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Further, no uniform policy for determining coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors in the United States. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. Moreover, third-party payors may require patients to obtain prior authorization before certain treatments, such as HEPTAZO, are provided. Therefore, we intend to contract with a third-party hub service to facilitate the pre-authorization process. 
 U.S. HealthCare Laws 
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal healthcare laws have been applied to restrict certain business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry in 
 
15 


  recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes, false claims statutes, data privacy and security laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for the purchase, lease, or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payment, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for statutory exemptions or safe harbor protection. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. 
 The federal False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. Additionally, the civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. 
 The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act its implementing regulations, require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually information related to certain payments or other transfers of value provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physicians assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals, as well as certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. 
 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements on covered entities, including certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, and their respective business associates that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity as well as their covered subcontractors relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates”. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 
16 


 The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the aforementioned federal fraud and abuse laws, some of which are broader in scope and apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Further, some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments or other transfers of value provided to physicians and other health care providers and entities, marketing expenditures, and drug pricing. Certain state and local laws also require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. 
 These federal and state laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and education programs. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including administrative, criminal and civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate its business and our results of operations. 
 Health Reform 
 In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the health care system and efforts to control health care costs, including drug prices, that could have a significant negative impact on our business, including preventing, limiting or delaying regulatory approval of our drug candidates and reducing the sales and profits derived from our products once they are approved. 
 For example, in the United States, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, or ACA, substantially changed the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers and has had a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things, subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for specified branded prescription drugs, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, expanded health care fraud and abuse laws, revised the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers to the state and federal government for covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated, imposed an additional rebate similar to an inflation penalty on new formulations of drugs, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to Medicaid managed care organizations, expanded the 340B program, which caps the price at which manufacturers can sell covered outpatient pharmaceuticals to specified hospitals, clinics and community health centers, and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research. 
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges and amendments to certain aspects of ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or Tax Act, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On June 17, 2021, the United States Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law and litigation and legislation over the ACA is likely to continue with unpredictable and uncertain results. 
 More recently, on August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, was signed into law by President Biden. The new legislation has implications for Medicare Part D, which is a program available to individuals who are entitled to Medicare Part A or enrolled in Medicare Part B to give them the option of paying a monthly premium for outpatient prescription drug coverage. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare (beginning in 2026), with prices that can be negotiated subject to a cap; imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize 
 
17 


  price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023); and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025). The IRA permits the Department of Health and Human Services to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. Further, the legislation subjects drug manufacturers to civil monetary penalties and a potential excise tax for failing to comply with the legislation by offering a price that is not equal to or less than the negotiated “maximum fair price” under the law or for taking price increases that exceed inflation. The legislation also requires manufacturers to pay rebates for drugs in Medicare Part D whose price increases exceed inflation. The new law also caps Medicare out-of-pocket drug costs at an estimated $4,000 a year in 2024 and, thereafter beginning in 2025, at $2,000 a year. 
 At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
 European Regulatory Environment 
 In the European Union, the CHEMOSAT system is subject to regulation as a medical device. The European Union is composed of the 27 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein. Under the EU Medical Device Directive (Directive No 93/42/EEC of 14 June 1993), as last amended, drug delivery products such as the CHEMOSAT system are governed by the EU laws on pharmaceutical products only if they are (i) placed on the market in such a way that the device and the pharmaceutical product form a single integral unit which is intended exclusively for use in the given combination, and (ii) the product is not reusable. In such cases, the drug delivery product is governed by the EU Code on Medicinal Products for Human Use (Directive 2001/83/EC, as last amended), while the essential requirements of the EU Medical Device Directive apply to the safety and performance-related device features of the product. Because we do not intend to place the CHEMOSAT system on the EU market as a single integral unit with melphalan, the product has been governed solely by the EU Medical Device Directive, while the separately marketed drug is governed by the EU Code relating to Medicinal Products for Human Use and other EU legislation applicable to drugs for human use. 
 In order to commercialize a medical device in the EU, we must comply with the essential requirements of the EU Medical Device Directive and more recently, the EU Medical Device Regulation. Compliance with these requirements entitles a manufacturer to affix a CE conformity mark, without which the products cannot be commercialized in the EU. To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements and obtain the right to affix the CE conformity mark, medical device manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. In April 2011, we obtained authorization to affix a CE Mark for the Generation One CHEMOSAT system and began European commercialization with this version of the CHEMOSAT system in early 2012. In April 2012, the Company obtained authorization to affix a CE Mark for the Generation Two CHEMOSAT system, and since this time all procedures in Europe have been performed with this version of the system. 
 The EU Medical Device Directive establishes a classification system placing devices into Class I, IIa, IIb, or III, depending on the risks and characteristics of the medical device. For certain types of low-risk medical devices (i.e., Class I devices which are non-sterile and do not have a measuring function), the manufacturer may issue an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the essential requirements of the EU Medical Device Directives. Other devices are subject to a conformity assessment procedure requiring the intervention of a Notified Body, which is an organization designated by a Member State of the EU to conduct conformity assessments. Under the EU Medical Device Directive, CHEMOSAT has been regulated as a Class IIb medical device and, as such, the Notified Body was not required to carry out an examination of the product’s design dossier as part of its conformity assessment prior to commercialization. The Company must comply with the essential requirements of the EU Medical Device Directive and, more recently, 
 
18 


  the EU Medical Device Regulation, and is subject to a conformity assessment procedure requiring the intervention of a Notified Body. The conformity assessment procedure for Class IIb medical devices requires the manufacturer to apply for the assessment of its quality system for the design, manufacture and inspection of its medical devices by a Notified Body. The Notified Body will audit the system to determine whether it conforms to the provisions of the EU Medical Device Directive. If the Notified Body’s assessment is favorable, it will issue a Full Quality Assurance Certificate, which enables the manufacturer to draw a Declaration of Conformity and affix the CE mark to the medical devices covered by the assessment. Thereafter, the Notified Body will carry out periodic audits to ensure that the approved quality system is applied by the manufacturer. 
 A manufacturer without a registered place of business in a Member State of the EU that places a medical device on the market under its own name must designate an authorized representative established in the EU who can act before, and be addressed by a Competent Authority on the manufacturer’s behalf with regard to the manufacturer’s obligations under the EU Medical Device Directive and, more recently, the EU Medical Device Regulation. The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Delcath Systems Ltd. located in Galway, Ireland, serves as the authorized representative of the Company. 
 The European Commission undertook a review of the EU Medical Device Directive legislative framework and promulgated REGULATION (EU) 2017/745 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 5 April 2017 on medical devices, amending Directive 2001/83/EC, Regulation EC) No 178/2002 and Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 and repealing Council Directives 90/385/EEC and 93/42/EEC. This new EU Medical Device Regulation became effective on May 25, 2017, marking the start of a 3-year transition period for manufacturers selling medical device in Europe to comply with the new EU Medical Device Regulation, which governs all facets of medical devices. The transition task is highly complex and touches every aspect of product development, manufacturing production, distribution and post marketing evaluation. Due to COVID-related delays experienced by the medical device industry and Notified Bodies alike, on April 17, 2020, the European Parliament adopted the European Commission’s proposal to postpone the implementation of the EU Medical Device Regulation or EU 2017/745 by 12 months or until May 26, 2021. Delcath did not achieve EU Medical Device Regulation certification by that date due to COVID-related delays; however, our CE Mark under the EU Medical Device Directive remained effective and allowed us to fully operate in Europe. 
 On February 28, 2022, CHEMOSAT received medical device certification under the new EU Medical Device Regulation, which replaced CHEMOSAT’s prior certification under the EU Medical Device Directive. Achieving EU Medical Device Regulation certification entails a detailed evaluation from a designated EU Notified Body, including an audit of quality systems and a review of documentation supporting safety and performance claims for the device. The EU Medical Device Regulation greatly expands upon existing EU Medical Device Directive requirements, including the level of clinical evidence supporting claims, post-marketing surveillance, database traceability, unique device identification or UDI and increased supply chain oversight. Under the EU Medical Device Regulation, CHEMOSAT’s designation has changed from a Class IIb to a Class III medical device. 
 In the EU, we must also comply with the Medical Device Vigilance System, which is designed to improve the protection of the health and safety of patients, users, and others by reducing the likelihood of recurrence of incidents related to the use of a medical device. Under this system, incidents are defined as any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of a device, as well as any inadequacy in the labeling or the instructions for use which, directly or indirectly, might lead to or might have led to the death of a patient, user or other persons or to a serious deterioration in their state of health. When a medical device is suspected to be a contributory cause of an incident, its manufacturer or authorized representative in the EU must report it to the Competent Authority of the Member State where the incident occurred. Incidents are generally investigated by the manufacturer. The manufacturer’s investigation is monitored by the Competent Authority, which may intervene, or initiate an independent investigation if considered appropriate. An investigation may conclude in the adoption of a Field Safety Corrective Action, or FSCA. An FSCA is an action taken by a manufacturer to reduce a risk of death or serious deterioration in the state of health associated with the use of a medical device that is already placed on the market. An FSCA may include device recall, modification exchange and destruction. 
 
19 


 The manufacturer or its authorized representative must notify its customers and/or the end users of the medical device of the FSCA via a Field Safety Notice. 
 In the EU, the off-label promotion of a pharmaceutical product is strictly prohibited under the EU Community Code on Medicinal Products, which provides that all information provided within the context of the promotion of a drug must comply with the information contained in its approved summary of product characteristics. Our product instructions and indication reference the chemotherapeutic agent melphalan hydrochloride. However, no melphalan labels in the EU reference our product, and the labels vary from country to country with respect to the approved indication of the drug and its mode of administration. In the exercise of their professional judgment in the practice of medicine, physicians are generally allowed, under certain conditions, to use or prescribe a product in ways not approved by regulatory authorities. Physicians intending to use our device must obtain melphalan separately for use with the CHEMOSAT system and must use melphalan independently at their discretion. 
 In the EU, the advertising and promotion of our products is also subject to EU Member States laws implementing the EU Medical Device Directive, Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, as well as other EU Member State legislation governing the advertising and promotion of medical devices. These laws may further limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may also impose limitations on our promotional activities with health care professionals. 
 Failure to comply with the EU Member State laws implementing the Medical Device Directive and, more recently, the EU Medical Device Regulation, the EU and EU Member State laws on the promotion of medicinal products or with other applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the EU Member State authorities. An enforcement action may result in any of the following: fines, imprisonment, orders forfeiting products or prohibiting or suspending their supply to the market, or requiring the manufacturer to issue public warnings, or to conduct a product recall. 
 Other International Regulations 
 We continue to evaluate commercial opportunities in select markets when resources are available and at an appropriate time. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents and trademarks, maintain trade secret and know-how protection, enforce our proprietary rights against infringers, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties. Because of the length of time and expense associated with developing new products and bringing them through the regulatory approval process, the health care industry places considerable emphasis on obtaining patent protection and maintaining trade secret protection for new technologies, products, processes, know-how, and methods. We hold rights in ten U.S. utility patents, one U.S. design patent, three pending U.S. utility patent applications, six issued foreign counterpart utility patents (including the validations of European Patents with claims directed to our filter and frame apparatus in 19 European countries, a European patent with claims directed to our filter apparatus and media in nine countries, and a European patent with claims to a kit of parts, directed to CHEMOSAT®, in 18 countries), five issued foreign counterpart design patents, and two pending foreign counterpart patent applications. Patents directed to our chemotherapy filtration system “Apparatus for Removing Chemotherapy Compounds from Blood” were issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office in July 2017, October 2018, August 2019, February 2020, and February 2022. The patent issued in August 2019 has claims to a kit of parts capable of being assembled for delivering a small molecule chemotherapeutic agent to a subject. These claims are directed to HEPZATO™ KIT. The patent that issued in February 2020 has claims directed to our methods of treatment. In February 2019, a patent was issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office with claims directed to a method of using our filter and frame apparatus and in August 2021 a patent was issued with claims directed to our filter and frame apparatus. A Hong Kong patent directed to our Filter and Frame Apparatus was issued in March 2018. A European patent was

  granted by the European Patent Office for our chemotherapy filtration apparatus in December 2018 and in July 2019 a European patent was granted by the European Patent Office with claims to a kit of parts, directed to CHEMOSAT®. A European patent directed to a method of using our filter and frame apparatus was granted in April 2019 by the European Patent Office. In August 2019, a European patent was granted by the European Patent Office with claims directed to our filter and frame apparatus and validated in eleven countries to provide additional European patent coverage for our filter and frame apparatus to the European patent directed to the frame apparatus that was granted in April 2017. When appropriate, we actively pursue protection of our proprietary products, technologies, processes, and methods by filing United States and international patent and trademark applications. We seek to pursue additional patent protection for technology invented through research and development, manufacturing, and clinical use of CHEMOSAT and HEPZATO that will enable us to expand our patent portfolio around advances to our current systems, technology, and methods for our current applications as well as beyond the treatment of cancers in the liver. In March 2022, a European patent was granted by the European Patent Office and validated in eight countries with claims to a kit of parts, directed to CHEMOSAT®. 
 There can be no assurance that the pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents, that patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to protect our technology or provide us with a competitive advantage. 
 To maintain our proprietary position, we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary technological experience to protect proprietary manufacturing processes, technology, and know-how relating to our business. We rely, in part, on confidentiality agreements with our marketing partners, employees, advisors, vendors and consultants to protect our trade secrets and proprietary technological expertise. In addition, we also seek to maintain our trade secrets through maintenance of the physical security of the premises where our trade secrets are located. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge. 
 In certain circumstances, United States patent law allows for the extension of a patent’s duration for a period of up to five years after FDA approval. We intend to seek extension for one of our patents after FDA approval if it has not expired prior to the date of approval. In addition to our proprietary protections, the FDA has granted us six orphan drug designations that provide us a seven-year period of exclusive marketing beginning on the date that our NDA is approved by the FDA for the designated orphan drug. While the exclusivity only applies to the indication for which the drug has been approved, we believe that this exclusivity will provide us with added protection once commercialization of an orphan drug designated product begins. There has been and continues to be substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and medical device areas. If a third party asserts a claim against us, we may be forced to expend significant time and money defending such actions and an adverse determination in any patent litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require us to redesign our product, require us to seek licenses from third parties and, if licenses are not available, prevent us from manufacturing, selling, or using our product. Additionally, we plan to enforce our intellectual property rights vigorously and may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights or to protect our trade secrets or know-how. Patent litigation can be costly and time consuming and there can be no assurance that the outcome will be favorable to us. 
 Competition 
 The healthcare industry is characterized by extensive research, rapid technological progress and significant competition from numerous healthcare companies and academic institutions. Competition in the cancer treatment industry is intense. We believe that the primary competitive factors for products addressing cancer include safety, efficacy, ease of use, reliability, price, and patient’s quality of life. We also believe that physician relationships, especially relationships with leaders in the medical, surgical, and oncology communities, are important competitive factors. We also believe that the current global economic conditions and new healthcare reforms 
 
21 


  could put competitive pressure on us, including reduced selling prices and potential reimbursement rates, and overall procedure rates. Certain markets in Europe are experiencing the effects of continued economic weakness, which is affecting healthcare budgets and reimbursement. 
 CHEMOSAT competes and, if approved by the FDA, HEPZATO will compete with all forms of liver cancer treatments, including surgery, systemic chemotherapy, focal therapies, and palliative care. In the disease states we are targeting there are also numerous clinical trials sponsored by third parties, which can compete for potential patients in the near term and may ultimately lead to new competitive therapies. 
 In January 2022, Immunocore Holdings plc announced FDA approval for KIMMTRAK (tebentafusp-tebn) for the treatment of HLA-A *02:01-positive adult patients with unresectable or metastatic uveal melanoma. This is the first drug approved specifically for patients with metastatic uveal melanoma. HLA-A *02:01 patients represent approximately 45% of patients with uveal melanoma. HEPZATO is approved can treat all mOM patients and will be the only drug to treat the remaining 55% of patients. Traditionally, metastatic uveal melanoma patients have been treated with a variety of local and regional techniques. There are numerous companies developing and marketing devices for the performance of focal therapies, including Boston Scientific Corporation, the Covidien Products division of Medtronic plc, Merit Medical Systems, Inc., Varian Medical Systems, Inc., Sirtex Medical Limited, AngioDynamics, Inc., and many others. 
 Gemcitabine plus cisplatin remains the standard of care for the treatment of ICC in patients who are not candidates for surgery. 
 Several therapies have been recently approved for unresectable or metastatic cutaneous melanoma, which may encompass liver metastases. Dabrafenib (Tafinlar™, GlaxoSmithKline plc), is indicated as a single agent for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E mutation and in combination with trametinib in unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations. Furthermore, trametinib (MEKINIST™, GlaxoSmithKline plc) is indicated as single agent (in addition to in combination with dabrafinib) for treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations. Previously approved melanoma therapies such as the biologic ipilimumab (Yervoy™, Bristol Myers Squibb Company) and the B-RAF targeted drug vemurafenib (Zelboraf™, Genentech, Inc.) may also be included in the competitive landscape for the treatment of metastatic liver disease. 
 Many of these treatments are approved in Europe and other global markets. 
 Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technological, research and development, marketing, and personnel resources. In addition, some of our competitors have considerable experience in conducting clinical trials, regulatory, manufacturing and commercialization capabilities. Our competitors may develop alternative treatment methods, or achieve earlier product development, in which case the likelihood of us achieving meaningful revenues or profitability will be substantially reduced. 
 Manufacturing and Quality Assurance 
 We manufacture certain critical medical device components, including our proprietary filter media, and assemble and package CHEMOSAT and HEPZATO at our facility in Queensbury, New York. Our European headquarters and distribution facility in Galway, Ireland conducts final manufacturing, processing, and assembly. We use third parties to manufacture some components of CHEMOSAT and HEPZATO. CHEMOSAT and HEPZATO and its components must be manufactured and sterilized in accordance with approved manufacturing and pre-determined performance specifications. In addition, certain components will require sterilization prior to distribution, and we use third-party vendors to perform the sterilization process. 
 We are required to comply with the FDA’s cGMP regulations and international quality system regulations, including those established by the International Standards Organization (ISO), with respect to products sold in the EU. We are required to maintain ISO 13485 certification for medical devices to be sold in the EU, which requires, among other items, an implemented quality system that applies to component quality, supplier control, product design and manufacturing operations. Our facilities are ISO 13485:2016 certified.
