ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
National Health Investors, Inc., established in 1991 as a Maryland corporation, is a self-managed real estate investment trust (“REIT”) specializing in sale-leaseback, joint-venture, mortgage and mezzanine financing of need-driven and discretionary senior housing and medical investments. Our portfolio consists of lease, mortgage and other note investments in independent living facilities, assisted living facilities, entrance-fee communities, senior living campuses, skilled nursing facilities, specialty hospitals and medical office buildings. Other investments have included marketable securities and, until 2016, a joint venture structured to comply with the provisions of the REIT Investment Diversification Empowerment Act of 2007 (“RIDEA”) through which we invested in facility operations managed by an independent third-party. We have funded our real estate investments primarily through: (1) operating cash flow, (2) debt offerings, including bank lines of credit and term debt, both unsecured and secured, and (3) the sale of equity securities.
At December 31, 2018, we had investments in real estate, mortgage and other notes receivable involving 232 facilities located in 33 states. These investments involve 151 senior housing properties, 76 skilled nursing facilities, 3 hospitals, 2 medical office buildings and other notes receivable. These investments (excluding our corporate office of $2,471,000) consisted of properties with an original cost of $2,815,894,000, rented under triple-net leases to 30 lessees, and $246,111,000 aggregate carrying value of mortgage and other notes receivable due from 10 borrowers.
Our investments in real estate and mortgage loans are secured by real estate located within the United States. We are managed as one reporting unit, rather than multiple reporting units, for internal reporting purposes and for internal decision making. Therefore, we have concluded that we operate as a single segment. Information about revenues from our tenants and borrowers, our net income, cash flows and balance sheet can be found in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Classification of Properties in our Portfolio
Senior Housing
As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio included 143 senior housing properties (“SHO”) leased to operators and mortgage loans secured by 8 SHOs. The SHOs in our portfolio are either need-driven or discretionary for end users and consist of independent living facilities, assisted living facilities, senior living campuses, and entrance-fee communities which are more fully described below.
Need-Driven Senior Housing
Assisted Living Facilities. As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio included 93 assisted living facilities (“ALF”) leased to operators and mortgage loans secured by 6 ALFs. ALFs are free-standing facilities that provide basic room and board functions for elderly residents. As residents typically receive assistance with activities of daily living such as bathing, grooming, administering medication and memory care services, we consider these facilities to be need-driven senior housing. On-site staff personnel are available to assist in minor medical needs on an as-needed basis. Operators of ALFs are typically paid from private sources without assistance from government. ALFs may be licensed and regulated in some states, but generally do not require the issuance of a Certificate of Need (“CON”) as required for skilled nursing facilities.
Senior Living Campuses. As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio included 10 senior living campuses (“SLC”) leased to operators. SLCs contain one or more buildings that include skilled nursing beds combined with an independent or assisted living facility that provides basic room and board functions for elderly residents. They may also provide assistance to residents with activities of daily living such as bathing, grooming and administering medication. On-site staff personnel are available to assist in minor medical needs on an as-needed basis. As the decision to transition to a senior living campus is typically more than a lifestyle choice and is usually driven by the need to receive some moderate level of care, we consider this facility type to be need-driven. Operators of SLCs are typically paid from private sources and from government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid for skilled nursing residents.
Discretionary Senior Housing
Independent Living Facilities. As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio included 30 independent living facilities (“ILF”) leased to operators. ILFs offer specially designed residential units for active senior adults and provide various ancillary services for their residents including restaurants, activity rooms and social areas. Services provided by ILF operators are generally paid from private sources without assistance from government payors. ILFs may be licensed and regulated in some states, but generally do not require the issuance of a CON as required for skilled nursing facilities. As ILFs typically do not provide assistance with activities of daily living, we consider the decision to transition to an ILF facility to be discretionary.
Entrance-Fee Communities. As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio included 10 entrance-fee communities (“EFC”) leased to operators and two mortgage loans secured by EFCs. Entrance-fee communities, frequently referred to as continuing care retirement communities, or CCRCs, typically include a combination of detached cottages, an independent living facility, an assisted living facility and a skilled nursing facility on one campus. These communities appeal to residents because there is no need to relocate when health and medical needs change. EFCs are classified as either Type A, B, or C depending upon the amount of healthcare benefits included in the entrance fee. “Type A” EFCs, or “Lifecare” communities, include substantially all future healthcare costs. Communities providing a modified healthcare contract offering access to skilled nursing care but only paying for a maximum number of days are referred to as “Type B” EFCs. Finally, “Type C” EFCs, the type in our lease portfolio, are fee-for-service communities which do not provide any healthcare benefits and correspondingly have the lowest entrance fees. However, monthly fees may be higher to reflect the current healthcare components delivered to each resident. EFC licensure is state-specific, but generally the skilled nursing beds included in our EFC portfolio are subject to state licensure and regulation. As the decision to transition to an EFC is typically made as a lifestyle choice and not as the result of a pressing medical concern, we consider the decision to transition to an EFC to be discretionary. Accordingly, the predominant source of revenue for operators of EFCs is from private payor sources.
Medical
As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio included 77 medical facilities leased to operators and mortgage loans secured by 4 medical facilities. The medical facilities within our portfolio consist of skilled nursing facilities, hospitals and medical office buildings, which are more fully described below.
5

Skilled Nursing Facilities. As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio included 72 skilled nursing facilities (“SNF”) leased to operators and mortgage loans secured by 4 SNFs. SNFs provide some combination of skilled and intermediate nursing and rehabilitative care, including speech, physical and occupational therapy. As the decision to utilize the services of a SNF is typically made as the result of a pressing medical concern, we consider this to be a need-driven medical facility. The operators of the SNFs receive payment from a combination of private pay sources and government payors such as Medicaid and Medicare. SNFs are required to obtain state licenses and are highly regulated at the federal, state and local level. Most SNFs must obtain a CON from the state before opening or expanding such facilities. Some SNFs also include assisted living beds.
Hospitals. As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio included 3 hospitals (“HOSP”) leased to operators. Hospitals provide a wide range of inpatient and outpatient services, including acute psychiatric and rehabilitation services, and are subject to extensive federal, state and local legislation and regulation. Hospitals undergo periodic inspections regarding standards of medical care, equipment and hygiene as a condition of licensure. Services provided by hospitals are generally paid for by a combination of private pay sources and government payors. As the decision to utilize the services of a hospital is typically made as the result of a pressing medical concern, we consider this to be a need-driven medical facility.
Medical Office Buildings. As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio included 2 medical office buildings (“MOB”) leased to operators. MOBs are specifically configured office buildings whose tenants are primarily physicians and other medical practitioners. As the decision to utilize the services of an MOB is typically made as a the result of a pressing medical concern, we consider this to be a need-driven medical facility. MOBs differ from conventional office buildings due to the special requirements of the tenants. Each of our MOBs is leased to one lessee and is either physically attached to or located on an acute care hospital campus. The lessee sub-leases individual office space to the physicians or other medical practitioners. The lessee is responsible to us for the lease obligations of the entire building, regardless of their ability to sub-lease the individual office space.
Nature of Investments
Our investments are typically structured as acquisitions of properties through purchase-leaseback transactions, acquisitions of properties from other real estate investors, loans or operations through structures allowed by RIDEA. We have provided construction loans for facilities for which we were already committed to provide long-term financing or for which the operator agreed to enter into a purchase option and lease with us upon completion of construction or after the facility is stabilized. The annual lease rates on our leases and the annual interest rates on our mortgage, construction and mezzanine loans ranged between 6.75% and 10% during 2018. We believe our lease and loan terms are competitive within our peer group. Typical characteristics of these transactions are as follows:
Leases. Our leases generally have an initial leasehold term of 10 to 15 years with one or more 5-year tenant renewal options. The leases are “triple net leases” under which the tenant is responsible for the payment of all taxes, utilities, insurance premiums, repairs and other charges relating to the operation of the properties, including required levels of capital expenditures each year. The tenant is obligated at its expense to keep all improvements, fixtures and other components of the properties covered by “all risk” insurance in an amount equal to at least the full replacement cost thereof, and to maintain specified minimal personal injury and property damage insurance, protecting us as well as the tenant. The leases also require the tenant to indemnify and hold us harmless from all claims resulting from the use, occupancy and related activities of each property by the tenant, and to indemnify us against all costs related to any release, discovery, clean-up and removal of hazardous substances or materials, or other environmental responsibility with respect to each facility. 
Most of our existing leases contain annual escalators in rent payments. For financial statement purposes, rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease where the lease contains fixed escalators. Certain of our operators hold purchase options allowing them to acquire properties they currently lease from NHI. When present, tenant purchase options generally give the lessee an option to purchase the underlying property for consideration determined by i) a sliding base dependent upon the extent of appreciation in the property plus a specified proportion of any appreciation; ii) our acquisition costs plus a specified proportion of any appreciation; iii) an agreed capitalization rate applied to the current rental; or iv) our acquisition costs plus a profit floor plus a specified proportion of any appreciation. Where stipulated above, appreciation may be established by independent appraisal.
Some of the obligations under the leases are guaranteed by the parent corporation of the lessee, if any, or affiliates or individual principals of the lessee. In some leases, the third-party operator will also guarantee some portion of the lease obligations. Some obligations are backed further by other collateral such as security deposits, equipment, furnishings and other personal property.
We monitor our triple-net lessee tenant credit quality and identify any material changes by performing the following activities:
6


• | Obtaining financial statements on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis to assess the operational trends of our tenants and the financial position and capability of those tenants


• | Calculating the operating cash flow for each of our tenants


• | Calculating the lease service coverage ratio and other ratios pertinent to our tenants


• | Obtaining property-level occupancy rates for our tenants


• | Verifying the payment of real estate taxes by our tenants


• | Obtaining certificates of insurance for each tenant


• | Obtaining financial statements of our lessee guarantors on an annual basis


• | Conducting a periodic inspection of our properties to ascertain proper maintenance, repair and upkeep


• | Monitoring those tenants with indications of continuing and material deteriorating credit quality through discussions with our executive management and Board of Directors

RIDEA Transactions. Our arrangement with an affiliate of Bickford Senior Living (“Bickford”) was structured to be compliant with the provisions of RIDEA which permitted NHI to receive rent payments through a triple-net lease between a property company and an operating company and gave NHI the opportunity to capture additional value on the improving performance of the operating company through distributions to a Taxable REIT Subsidiary (“TRS”). Accordingly, the TRS held our 85% equity interest in an unconsolidated operating company, which we did not control, and provided an organizational structure that allowed the TRS to engage in a broad range of activities and share in revenues that would otherwise be non-qualifying income under the REIT gross income tests. The TRS is subject to state and federal income taxes. Our RIDEA arrangement ended on September 30, 2016, upon mutual agreement for NHI and Bickford to convert the buildings in the RIDEA to a traditional triple-net lease structure.
Mortgage loans. We have first mortgage loans with maturities of at least 5 years from inception, with varying amortization schedules from interest-only to fully-amortizing. Most of the loans are at a fixed interest rate; however, some interest rates increase based on a fixed schedule. In most cases, the owner of the facility is committed to make minimum annual capital expenditures for the purpose of maintaining or upgrading their respective facility. Additionally, most of our loans are collateralized by first mortgage liens and corporate or personal guarantees. Currently, our first mortgage loans carry interest rates which range from 6.75% to 9%.
We have made mortgage loans to borrowers secured by a second deed-of-trust where there is a process in place for the borrower to obtain long-term financing, primarily with a U.S. government agency, and where the historical financial performance of the underlying facility meets our loan underwriting criteria.
Mezzanine loans. Frequently in situations calling for temporary financing or when our borrowers’ in-place lending arrangements prohibit the extension of first mortgage security, we typically accept a second mortgage position or extend credit based on corporate and/or personal guarantees. These mezzanine loans often combine with an NHI purchase option covering the subject property. Our mezzanine loans currently carry an interest rate of 10%.
Construction loans. From time to time, we also provide construction loans that convert to mortgage loans upon the completion of the construction of the subject facility. We may also obtain a purchase option to acquire the facility at a future date and lease the facility back to the operator. During the term of the construction loan, funds are usually advanced pursuant to draw requests made by the borrower in accordance with the terms and conditions of the loan. Interest is typically assessed on these loans at rates equivalent to the eventual mortgage rate upon conversion. In addition to the security of the lien against the property, we will generally require additional security and collateral in the form of either payment and performance completion bonds or completion guarantees by the borrower’s parent, affiliates of the borrower or one or more of the individuals who control the borrower. We currently have construction loans bearing interest ranging from 6.75% to 9%.
Other notes receivable. We have provided a revolving credit facility to a borrower whose business is to provide bridge loans to owner-operators who are qualifying for long-term HUD financing secured by real estate. Our interest rate on the credit facility is 10%. We have provided loans to borrowers involved in the skilled nursing and senior housing industries who have pledged personal and business guarantees as security for the loans. The interest rates on these loans typically range from 8.25% to 10%.
Investment in marketable securities. From time to time we have invested a portion of our funds in various marketable securities with quoted market prices, including the common shares of other publicly-held REITs. We classify these highly-liquid securities as available-for-sale and carry the investments at their then quoted fair market value at the balance sheet date. We may choose to liquidate these investments to invest the proceeds into real estate assets. We currently have no investments in marketable securities.
Competition and Market Conditions
7

We compete primarily with other REITs, private equity funds, banks and insurance companies in the acquisition, leasing and financing of health care real estate.
Operators of our facilities compete on a local and regional basis with operators of facilities that provide comparable services. Operators compete for residents and/or patients and staff based on quality of care, reputation, physical appearance of facilities, services offered, family preference, physicians, staff and price. Competition is with other operators as well as companies managing multiple facilities, some of which are substantially larger and have greater resources than the operators of our facilities. Some of these facilities are operated for profit, while others are owned by governmental agencies or tax exempt not-for-profit entities.
The SNFs which either secure our mortgage loans or we lease to third-party operators receive the majority of their revenues from Medicare, Medicaid and other government payors. From time to time, these facilities have experienced revenue reductions brought about by the enactment of legislation to reduce government costs. In particular, the establishment of a Medicare Prospective Payment System (“PPS”) for SNF services, to replace the cost-based reimbursement system, significantly reduced Medicare reimbursement to SNF providers. While Congress subsequently took steps to mitigate the impact of PPS on SNFs, other federal legislative policies have been adopted and continue to be proposed that would reduce the growth rate of Medicare and/or Medicaid payments to SNFs. Effective October 1, 2019, a Patient Driven Payment Model (PDPM) was adopted as a case-mix system for classifying patient information payment groups under PPS. State Medicaid funding is not expected to keep pace with inflation according to industry studies. Any changes in government reimbursement methodology that reduce reimbursement to levels that are insufficient to cover the operating costs of our lessees and borrowers could indirectly and adversely impact us.
Our senior housing properties generally rely on private-pay residents who may be negatively impacted in an economic downturn. For example, a resident may intend to sell his or her house in order to afford the cost of residing in an ILF or ALF. In addition, the success of these properties is often impacted by the existence of comparable, competing facilities in a local market.
Operator Diversification
For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 25% of our portfolio revenue was from publicly-owned operators, 56% was from regional operators, 17% from privately owned national chains which are privately owned and 2% was from smaller operators. We consider the creditworthiness of the operator to be an important factor in underwriting the lease or loan investment, and we generally have the right to approve any changes in operators.
For the year ended December 31, 2018, tenants which provided more than 3% of our total revenues were (in alphabetical order): Bickford Senior Living; Chancellor Health Care; The Ensign Group; Health Services Management; Holiday Retirement; National HealthCare Corporation; and Senior Living Communities. We will make reference to the parent company whenever we describe our business with these tenants, their subsidiaries and/or affiliates.
Major Customers
We have four operators, Holiday Retirement (“Holiday”), Senior Living Communities, LLC (“Senior Living”), National HealthCare Corporation (“NHC”) and Bickford, from whom we individually derive at least 10% of our total revenues, and 62% collectively.
Holiday
As of December 31, 2018, we leased 25 independent living facilities to an affiliate of Holiday. The 17-year master lease began in December 2013 and provided for a minimum escalator of 3.5% after 2017. Of our total revenues, $43,311,000 (15%), $43,817,000 (16%) and $43,817,000 (18%) were derived from Holiday for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, including $5,616,000, $7,397,000 and $8,965,000 in straight-line rent, respectively. Our tenant operates the facilities pursuant to a management agreement with a Holiday-affiliated manager.
On November 5, 2018, we executed an Amendment to Master Lease and Termination of Guaranty with Holiday that significantly altered the master lease and extended its maturity to December 31, 2035. Apart from certain credit enhancements provided by our tenant, we agreed to decrease the annual rent under the existing master lease from approximately $39,000,000 scheduled in 2019 to $31,500,000 for the 25 facilities under the lease effective January 1, 2019. Annual lease escalators will go into effect on November 1, 2020 with a floor of 2% and a ceiling of 3%, such lease being secured by one-half of the original cash deposit of $21,275,000, with the other half of the deposit, or $10,637,000, being released to NHI. Further modifications of the existing master lease with NHI called for cash or a combination of cash and real estate equaling $55,125,000, at NHI’s option in 2019, for total consideration of $65,762,000. Accordingly, on January 31, 2019, we acquired a facility from Holiday in Vero Beach, Florida at a cost of 
8

$38,000,000 with a first year lease amount of $2,550,000 plus annual escalators as described above. Holiday settled the remaining payable to NHI with cash of $17,125,000 at closing.
Senior Living Communities
As of December 31, 2018, we leased nine retirement communities to Senior Living Communities (“Senior Living”) totaling 1,970 units under a 15-year master lease which began in December 2014, contains two 5-year renewal options and provides for an annual escalator of 4% in 2018 and 3% thereafter.
Of our total revenues, $45,868,000 (16%), $45,735,000 (16%) and $40,332,000 (16%) were derived from the Senior Living lease for the years ending December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, including $5,436,000, $6,984,000 and $7,369,000, respectively, in straight-line rent.
In December 2014, we provided a $15,000,000 revolving line of credit to Senior Living, the maturity of which mirrors the term of the master lease, but subject to reduction to $5,000,000 in 2019 and going forward. Borrowings are used primarily to finance construction projects within the Senior Living portfolio, including building additional units. Amounts outstanding under the facility, $1,900,000 at December 31, 2018, bear interest at an annual rate equal to the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate, 2.69% at December 31, 2018, plus 6%.
In March 2016, we extended two mezzanine loans of up to $12,000,000 and $2,000,000, respectively, to affiliates of Senior Living, to partially fund construction of a 186-unit senior living campus on Daniel Island in South Carolina. The loans bear interest payable monthly at a 10% annual rate and mature in March 2021. The loans were fully drawn as of December 31, 2018, and provide NHI with a purchase option on the campus upon its meeting certain operational metrics. The option is to remain open during the term of the loans, plus any extensions.
NHC
We lease 42 facilities to NHC comprised of 3 independent living facilities and 39 skilled nursing facilities (4 of which are subleased to other parties for whom the lease payments are guaranteed to us by NHC). These facilities are leased to NHC under the terms of an amended Master Lease Agreement dated October 17, 1991 (the “1991 lease”) which includes our 35 remaining legacy properties and a Master Lease Agreement dated August 30, 2013 (the “2013 lease”) which includes 7 skilled nursing facilities acquired from a third party. Under the terms of the 1991 lease, base annual rental of $30,750,000 escalates by 4% of the increase, if any, in each facility’s revenue over a 2007 base year. Similarly, the 2013 lease provides for base annual rental of $3,450,000 plus percentage rent equal to 4% of the increase, if any, in each facility’s annual patient housing revenue over a 2014 base year. The NHC escalator is contingent upon future facility revenue increases and therefore does not give rise to straight-line revenues. 
Of our total revenues, $37,843,000 (13%), $37,467,000 (13%) and $37,626,000 (15%) in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, were derived from NHC.
NHC owned 1,630,462 shares of our common stock at December 31, 2018. The chairman of our board of directors is also a director on NHC’s board.
Bickford
As of December 31, 2018 our Bickford lease portfolio is structured as follows (in thousands):

 | June 2023 | September 2024 | September 2027 | May 2031 | April 2033 | Total
Number of Properties | 13 | | 10 | | 4 | | 20 | | 5 | | 52 
2018 Annual Contractual Rent | $ | 11,133 | | $ | 9,264 | | $ | 1,515 | | $ | 19,988 | $ | 3,165 | $ | 45,065
Straight Line Rent Adjustment | 588 | | (260 | ) | 221 | | 3,865 | | 614 | | 5,028 
Total Revenues | $ | 11,721 | | $ | 9,004 | | $ | 1,736 | | $ | 23,853 | $ | 3,779 | $ | 50,093

On April 30, 2018, we acquired an assisted living/memory-care portfolio in Ohio and Pennsylvania totaling 320 units and comprising five facilities, one of which is subject to a ground lease with remaining term, including extensions, of 50 years. The purchase price was $69,750,000, inclusive of $500,000 in closing costs and $1,750,000 in specified capital improvements, which 
9

will be added to the lease base upon funding. We included this portfolio in a separate master lease with Bickford which provides for a lease rate of 6.85%, with annual fixed escalators over a term of 15 years plus renewal options, subject to a fair market value rent reset feature available to NHI between years three and five.
Of our total revenues, $50,093,000 (17%), $41,606,000 (15%) and $30,732,000 (12%) were recognized as rental income from Bickford for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, including $5,028,000, $5,102,000, and $858,000 in straight-line rent income, respectively.
At December 31, 2018, our ALF construction loans to Bickford are summarized as follows:

Commencement | Rate | Maturity | Commitment | | Drawn | | Location
July 2016 | 9% | 5 years | $ | 14,000,000 | | | $ | (13,047,000 | ) | Illinois
January 2017 | 9% | 5 years | 14,000,000 | | | (11,931,000 | ) | | Michigan
January 2018 | 9% | 5 years | 14,000,000 | | | (4,515,000 | ) | | Virginia
July 2018 | 9% | 5 years | 14,700,000 | | | (2,978,000 | ) | | Michigan
 | | | $ | 56,700,000 | | | $ | (32,471,000 | ) | 

The promissory notes are secured by first mortgage liens on substantially all real and personal property as well as a pledge of any and all leases or agreements which may grant a right of use to the subject property. Usual and customary covenants extend to the agreements, including the borrower’s obligation for payment of insurance and taxes. NHI has a purchase option on the properties at stabilization, whereby annual rent will be set with a floor of 9.55%, based on NHI’s total investment, plus fixed annual escalators.

Sources of Revenues
General. Our revenues are derived primarily from rental income, mortgage and other note interest income and income from our other investments, substantially all of which were in marketable securities, including the common stock of other healthcare REITs. During 2018, rental income was $280,813,000 (95.3%), interest income from mortgages and other notes was $13,220,000 (4.6%) and other income was $579,000 (0.1%) of total revenue of $294,612,000, an increase of 5.7% over 2017. Our revenues depend on the operating success of our tenants and borrowers whose source and amount of revenues are determined by (i) the licensed beds or other capacity of the facility, (ii) their occupancy rate, (iii) the extent to which the services provided at each facility are utilized by the residents and patients, (iv) the mix of private pay, Medicare and Medicaid patients, and (v) the rates paid by private payors and by the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
Government Regulation
Medicare and Medicaid. A significant portion of the revenue of our SNF lessees and borrowers is derived from government funded reimbursement programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Reimbursement under these programs is subject to periodic payment review and other audits by federal and state authorities. Medicare is uniform nationwide and reimburses skilled nursing facilities under PPS which is based on a predetermined, fixed amount. PPS is an acuity based classification system that uses nursing and therapy indexes adjusted by geographical wage indexes to calculate per diem rates for each Medicare patient. Payment rates are updated annually and are generally adjusted each October when the federal fiscal year begins. The current acuity classification system is named Resource Utilization Groups IV (“RUGs IV”) and was effective October 1, 2010. Federal legislative policies have been adopted and continue to be proposed that would provide small increases in annual Medicare payments to skilled nursing facilities. For example, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) announced the Skilled Nursing Facilities – PPS final rule for fiscal year 2019 which increased Medicare payments to SNF operators by only 2.4% beginning October 1, 2018.
Most notably, the new Patient Driven Payment Model (“PDPM”), which will replace the existing RUGs IV model beginning in FY 2020 (effective October 1, 2019), focuses on a resident’s clinical condition and care needs, rather than the volume of care provided.  PDPM is characterized as a value-based, unified post-acute care payment system that prioritizes the unique care needs of patients and reduces the administrative burden associated with the system. PDPM is a case-mix classifications system for classifying SNF patients in a Medicare Part A covered stay into payment groups under the SNF PPS.
Medicaid is a joint federal and state program designed to provide medical assistance to “eligible needy persons.” Medicaid programs are operated by state agencies that adopt their own medical reimbursement methodology and standards. Payment rates and covered services vary from state to state. In many instances, revenues from Medicaid programs are insufficient to cover the actual costs incurred in providing care to those patients. With regard to Medicaid payment increases to skilled nursing operators, changes in federal funding coupled with state budget problems have produced uncertainty. States will more than likely be unable to keep pace with SNF inflation. States are under pressure to pursue other alternatives to long term care such as community and home-based services. Furthermore, several of the states in which we have investments have actively sought to reduce or slow the increase of Medicaid spending for SNF care.
Medicare and Medicaid programs are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes resulting from legislation, adoption of rules and regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing law. Moreover, as health care facilities have experienced increasing pressure from private payors attempting to control health care costs, reimbursement from private payors has in many cases effectively been reduced to levels approaching those of government payors. Healthcare reimbursement will likely continue to be of significant importance to federal and state programs. We cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or the effect that any future legislative reforms may have on our lessees’ and borrowers’ costs of doing business and on the amount of reimbursement by government and other third-party payors. There can be no assurance that future payment rates for either government or private payors will be sufficient to cover cost increases in providing services to patients. Any changes in government or private payor reimbursement policies which reduce payments to levels that are insufficient to cover the cost of providing patient care could adversely affect the operating revenues of tenants and borrowers in our properties that rely on such payments, and thereby adversely affect their ability to make their lease or debt payments to us.
Licensure and Certification. The health care industry is highly regulated by federal, state and local law and is directly affected by state and local licensing requirements, facility inspections, state and federal reimbursement policies, regulations concerning capital and other expenditures, certification requirements and other such laws, regulations and rules. Sanctions for failure to comply with these regulations and laws include (but are not limited to) loss of licensure, fines and loss of certification to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, as well as potential criminal penalties. The failure of any tenant or borrower to comply with such laws, requirements and regulations could affect their ability to operate the facility or facilities and could adversely affect such tenant’s or borrower’s ability to make lease or debt payments to us.

In the past several years, due to rising health care costs, there has been an increased emphasis on detecting and eliminating fraud and abuse in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Payment of any consideration in exchange for referral of Medicare and Medicaid patients is generally prohibited by federal statute, which subjects violators to severe penalties, including exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, fines and even prison sentences. In recent years, both federal and state governments have significantly increased investigation and enforcement activity to detect and punish wrongdoers. In addition, legislation has been adopted at both state and federal levels which severely restrict the ability of physicians to refer patients to entities in which they have a financial interest.
It is anticipated that the trend toward increased investigation and enforcement activity in the area of fraud and abuse, as well as self-referral, will continue in future years. Certain of our investments are with lessees or borrowers which are partially or wholly owned by physicians. In the event that any lessee or borrower were to be found in violation of laws regarding fraud and abuse or self-referral, that lessee’s or borrower’s ability to operate the facility could be jeopardized, which could adversely affect the lessee’s or borrower’s ability to make lease or debt payments to us and could thereby adversely affect us.
Certificates of Need . The SNFs and hospitals in which we invest are also generally subject to state statutes which may require regulatory approval in the form of a CON prior to the construction or expansion of facilities to accommodate new beds (or addition of new beds to existing facilities), the addition of services or certain capital expenditures. CON requirements are not uniform throughout the United States and are subject to change. We cannot predict the impact of regulatory changes with respect to CONs on the operations of our lessees and borrowers; however, in our primary market areas, a significant reduction in new construction of long-term care beds has occurred.
Investment Policies
Our investment objectives are (i) to provide consistent and growing current income for distribution to our stockholders through investments primarily in health care related facilities or in the operations thereof through independent third-party management, (ii) to provide the opportunity to realize capital growth resulting from appreciation, if any, in the residual value of our portfolio properties, and (iii) to preserve and protect stockholders’ capital through a balance of diversity, flexibility and liquidity. There can be no assurance that these objectives will be realized. Our investment policies include making investments in real estate, mortgage and other notes receivable, marketable securities (including the common stock of other REITs) and joint ventures structured to comply with the provisions of RIDEA.
During 2018, we made commitments to fund new investments in real estate and loans totaling approximately $364,344,000. In making new investments, we consider such factors as (i) the geographic area and type of property, (ii) the location, construction quality, condition and design of the property, (iii) the current and anticipated cash flow and its adequacy to meet operational needs, and lease or mortgage obligations to provide a competitive income return to our investors, (iv) the growth, tax and regulatory environments of the communities in which the properties are located, (v) occupancy and demand for similar facilities in the same or nearby communities, (vi) the quality, experience and creditworthiness of the management operating the facilities located on the property and (vii) the mix of private and government-sponsored residents. There can be no assurances that investments meeting our standards regarding these attributes will be found or closed.
We will not, without the approval of a majority of the Board of Directors and review of a committee comprised of independent directors, enter into any joint venture relationships with or acquire from or sell to any director, officer or employee of NHI, or any affiliate thereof, as the case may be, any of our assets or other property.
The Board of Directors, without the approval of the stockholders, may alter our investment policies if it determines that such a change is in our best interests and our stockholders’ best interests. The methods of implementing our investment policies may vary as new investment and financing techniques are developed or for other reasons. Management may recommend changes in investment criteria from time to time.
Future investments in healthcare related facilities may utilize borrowed funds or issuance of equity when it is advisable in the opinion of the Board of Directors. We may negotiate lines of credit or arrange for other short or long-term borrowings from lenders. We may arrange for long-term borrowings from institutional investors or through public offerings. We have previously invested, and may in the future invest, in properties subject to existing loans or secured by mortgages, deeds of trust or similar liens with favorable terms or in mortgage investment pools.
