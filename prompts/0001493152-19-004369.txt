Item 1. Description of Business.
Organization
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on February 27, 2014, with fiscal year end on December 31, under the original name Tech Foundry Ventures, Inc. On July 6, 2016, we changed our name to Nevada Canyon Gold Corp. On April 28, 2016, we split our common stock on a 10:1 basis without affecting the par value. All shares and per share amounts have been retroactively restated to account for the split.
 
We have never been party to any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding, nor have we undergone any material reclassification, merger, consolidation, purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of business.
 
We were a consulting service company, which provided management and consulting services to early and middle stage start-ups. We were engaged by our first client in June 2015. In December 2015, we changed our business to mineral exploration, when we acquired all of Nevada Canyon Gold Corporation’s - a privately held Nevada corporation (“NCG”) - rights, titles and interests in and to an exploration agreement, dated for reference September 15, 2015, with an option to form a joint venture (the “Agreement”) with Walker River Resources Corp., a Canadian public company (TSX.V:WRR) on its wholly-owned Lapon Canyon Gold Project (the “Project”).
 
Our principal business, executive and registered statutory office is located at 316 California Avenue, Suite 543, Reno, NV 89509 and our telephone number is (888) 909-5548, fax is (888) 909-1033 and email contact is info@nevadacanyongold.com. Our website address is www.nevadacanyongold.com.
 
Business
 
Lapon Canyon Project
 
We were a party to an Exploration Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Option to form a Joint Venture with Walker River Resources Corp. (“WRR”) on its wholly-owned Lapon Canyon Project located approximately 40 miles southeast of Yerington, Nevada. The Agreement did not grant us an interest in or to the Project, or any equity interest in WRR, but rather, granted us the right to earn up to an undivided 50% interest in the Project by incurring eligible expenditures of $500,000 (over a two-year period) in exploration and other expenses required to carry out a work program established and operated by WRR on the Project (the “Eligible Expenses”).
 
On July 5, 2017, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with WRR on the Project. As at the date of the Purchase Agreement our interest in the Project was 30%. Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, WRR agreed to buy back our 30% interest in the Project in exchange for 9,100,000 common shares of WRR and warrants to acquire an additional 11,900,000 common shares. Each WRR Warrant is exercisable for a period of five years without further consideration into one common share in the capital of WRR. The terms of the WRR Warrants contain a provision which prevents us from exercising any of the WRR Warrants which would result in us owning 10% or more of the issued and outstanding shares of WRR. The above securities were issued on July 18, 2017, upon acceptance of the Purchase Agreement by the TSX Venture Exchange, and were subject to a hold period which expired on November 20, 2017.
 
Garfield Flats Project
 
On June 7, 2017, we entered into an exploration lease and option to purchase agreement (the “Garfield Agreement”) with Goodsprings Development LLC (“Goodsprings”), a Nevada limited liability corporation on the Garfield Flats Project (the “Garfield Property”), consisting of six Orsa Claims and six Lazy Claims totaling 240 acres located in sections 27 and 28 of T7N, R32E, Mineral County, Nevada about 18 miles southeast of the town of Hawthorne. The term of the Garfield Agreement was ten years and was subject to extension for two additional terms of ten years each.

In order to retain the rights to the exploration lease, we were required to make the following minimum annual payments:
 

 | Minimum Payment | 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------+-------
Upon execution of the option agreement (the “Effective Date”)(paid) | $ | 15,000
First anniversary of the Effective Date | $ | 15,000
Second and third anniversaries of the Effective Date | $ | 20,000
Fourth and fifth anniversaries of the Effective Date | $ | 25,000
Sixth and each succeeding anniversary of the Effective Date in perpetuity | $ | 40,000

 
In addition to the minimum annual payments, we agreed to pay Goodsprings a 2% production royalty based on the gross returns from the production and sale of minerals from the Garfield Property.
 
At any time during the term of the Agreement, we retained a right to acquire 100% ownership of the Garfield Property for a one-time payment of $300,000 (the “Purchase Price”). The minimum annual payments paid by us to Goodsprings, could not be applied or credited against the Purchase Price, however, once the option to acquire the Garfield Property was exercised, the minimum annual payments were to be credited against the production royalties payable.
 
During our Fiscal 2017, we staked an additional 69 Orsa Claims and 75 Lazy Claims, with a total paid cost of $54,152. These claims were added to the Garfield Flats Project.
 
On July 11, 2018, we entered into a definitive purchase agreement with WRR for the sale of the Garfield Agreement. Full consideration for the Garfield Agreement consisted of a one-time cash payment of $55,000 (the “Cash Consideration”). In lieu of the Cash Consideration, WRR agreed to extinguish the $55,000 note payable the Company issued to WRR during its fiscal 2017. This transaction resulted in a loss from the sale of the mineral interest of $14,152.
 
Lazy Claims
 
On August 2, 2017, we entered into an exploration lease agreement (the “Lazy Claims Agreement”) with Tarsis Resources US Inc. (“Tarsis”), a Nevada corporation, to lease rights to three additional Lazy claims totaling 60 acres and located in the vicinity of the Garfield Property (the “Lazy Claims”). The term of the Lazy Claims Agreement is ten years and is subject to extension for an additional two consecutive 10-year terms. Full consideration of the Lazy Claims Agreement consists of the following: an initial cash payment of $1,000 to Tarsis, which we paid upon the execution of the Lazy Claims Agreement, with $2,000 payable to Tarsis on each subsequent anniversary of the effective date. We agreed to pay Tarsis a 2% production royalty (the “Lazy Claims Royalty”) based on the gross returns from the production and sale of minerals from the Lazy Claims Property. Should the Lazy Claims Royalty payments to Tarsis be in excess of $2,000 per year, we will not be required to pay a $2,000 annual minimum payment. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we retain our leasing rights to the Lazy Claims.
 
As of the date of this Annual report on Form 10-K, our mineral interests are represented by Lazy Claims Property
 
Location and means of access
 
The Lazy Claims consist of 3 claims (60 acres) and are located within the Walker Lane shear zone, a 60-mile-wide structural corridor extending in a southeast direction from Reno, Nevada. The Project is located in Mineral County, Nevada, with year-round access and established infrastructure, 18 miles southeast of Hawthorne, NV via U.S. Highway 95.

Geology and Mineralization
 
Geology
 
The US Geological Survey has mapped the area and has published the results as Miscellaneous Field Studies maps, MF 1485 and MF 1486. Mapped units include Paleozoic metasediments, Mesozoic sediments and intrusions, and Cenozoic volcanic rocks and porphyry intrusions. Like most of the Walker Lane, the area has a strong system of N50W- trending, normal and strike-slip faults along with a series of generally NE-trending thrust faults. The area has seen prospecting since the late 1800’s and contains hundreds of prospect pits and adits that explore various styles of base and precious metal mineralization.
 
The published USGS geologic quadrangle map for the Pamlico mine area, (MF 1485, MF 1486, Oldow, 1985), shows the eastern portion of the Lazy Claims project area underlain by a thick, undivided sequence of folded and faulted Mesozoic and or Paleozoic volcanic and sedimentary rocks. The western portion of the project is underlain by Jurassic- to Triassic-age Sunrise and Gabbs Formations comprising interbedded limestones and calcareous mudstones. Locally, black Tertiary basalt caps the older rocks. The structural fabric is dominated by NW-trending, Walker Lane structures and by an older N70o E fabric, several phases of strongly altered and locally mineralized intrusive rocks as well as zones of jasperoids and strong silicification has been identified.
 
Mineralization
 
Previous work on the project has identified the following discrete zones of mineralization: (1) the Lazy Man gold zone which is a structurally-controlled, intrusion-related gold deposit that produced about 1,200 oz Au from NW-trending, high grade zones partially hosted by altered rhyolite dikes, (2) areas of strong vuggy silica alteration in both intrusive porphyritic rocks and volcanic agglomerates particularly in the footwall of the Lazy Man zone, (3) a large area of barite and copper mineralization with intense bleaching east of the gold zone, (4) strong copper showings to the southeast of the gold zone, (5) the Loman antimony mine to the southwest of the gold zone, (6) skarn zones to the west of the gold zone, (7) a large zone of strong IP response to the west of the gold zone, and (8) a pyrrhotite porphyry intrusion west of the gold zone.
Exploration History
 
The Lazy Claims cover several past-producing small-scale high-grade mines, altered and mineralized zones discovered by geological compilations and mapping of the historical workings, discovered by the previous exploration on the Project. The previous sampling on the project has revealed the presence of copper, bismuth, and antimony as well as pervasive lower grade gold mineralization, cut by vein structures (some previously mined) of higher grade gold. Previous induced polarization surveys also denoted the presence of significant coincident I.P. anomalies. Below is a summary of previous exploration of identified mineralized areas within the properties.
Lazy Man Mine
 
The main structure that the mine workings explore has an N35oW trend and dips about 60o to the southwest. The vein was discovered in 1933 by a local prospector. The mine is credited with historic production of about 1,200 ounces of gold from 2,800 feet (853 m) of underground workings. The three main shafts explore about 1,000 feet (304 m) of strike length on the vein, and the shafts extend to a maximum depth of 300 feet (91 m). The workings have been mapped and sampled in some detail by Congdon and Carey in 1974, and many multi-ounce gold values are noted in the remaining vein material. One 4.9 foot-long (1.5 m) sample from a cross cut on the 300 level contained 2.2 oz Au/ton (68.4g/t). The high-grade veins occur within a broader zone of intense quartz-sericite alteration, which has previously been mapped as rhyolite. Most of the mine dumps are composed of this “rhyolite”, and Congdon and Carey measured approximately 8,000 tons of this material containing from 0.09 to 0.21 oz Au/ton (3.07 to 7.1 g/t Au). Gold occurs in iron oxide-filled fractures along with druzy quartz veinlets, and there is occasionally visible gold. Detailed mapping around the old workings of the Lazy Man mine has delineated a zone of intense acid-leaching in intrusive porphyritic rocks and volcanic agglomerates primarily in the footwall of the vein. The rock now has a porous and vuggy appearance; this style of alteration is interpreted to be “Vuggy Silica” alteration that is typical of the upper levels of high-sulfidation ore deposits. Surrounding the vuggy silica zone is a zone of strong argillic alteration. Recent work has discovered previously unrecognized mineralized zones east of and parallel to the Lazy Man vein that contain silicified, brecciated outcrops assaying 2.26 g/t Au and 8,150 ppm As. These zones have been traced for over 1,200 feet (365 m) and are up to 60 feet (18 m) wide.

Exploration program
 
In 2018 the Company completed its initial geological compilation and review of the Lazy Claims project. This included a review of the altered and mineralized zones discovered by previous geological compilations and mapping of the historical workings, including the planning of the 2019 exploration program. Phase I of the Lazy Claims exploration program will consist of reconnaissance prospecting, geological mapping, surface trenching, relocating historical workings and ground based geophysical surveys. This reconnaissance program will provide accurate modern data to assist in the planning of the phase II drill program. Phase I is set to begin in the spring of 2019, with phase II expected to begin following the compilation of the phase I results, later in 2019.
 
Competition
 
The mineral exploration business is an extremely competitive industry. We are competing with many other exploration companies looking for minerals. We are one of the smallest exploration companies and a very small participant in the mineral exploration business. Being a junior mineral exploration company, we compete with other similar companies for financing and joint venture partners, and for resources such as professional geologists, camp staff, helicopters, and mineral exploration contractors and supplies. We do not represent a competitive presence in the industry.
 
Raw materials
 
The raw materials for our exploration programs include camp equipment, hand exploration tools, sample bags, first aid supplies, groceries, and propane. All of these types of materials are readily available from a variety of local suppliers.
 
Dependence on Customers
 
As a junior exploration company, we have no customers.
 
Trademarks and Patents
 
We have no intellectual property such as patents or trademarks and, other than the obligations under the exploration lease agreement with Tarsis Resources US Inc., no royalty agreements or labor contracts.
Need For Any Government Approval of Principal Products or Services
 
We are not required to obtain permits or submit operational plans in order to conduct exploration on the Lazy Claims. The mining business, however, is subject to various levels of government controls and regulations, which are supplemented and revised from time to time. We cannot predict what additional legislation or revisions might be proposed that could affect our business or when any proposals, if enacted, might become effective. Such changes, however, could require more operating capital and expenditures and could prevent or delay some of our operations.
 
The various levels of government controls and regulations address, among other things, the environmental impact of mining and mineral processing operations. For mining and processing, legislation and regulations in various jurisdictions establish performance standards, air and water quality emission standards and other design or operational requirements for various components of operations, including health and safety standards. Legislation and regulations also establish requirements for decommissioning, reclaiming and rehabilitating mining properties following the cessation of operations, and may require that some former mining properties be managed for long periods of time. As we are not mining or processing, and are unlikely to do so for some years, we have not investigated these regulations.
 
None of the exploration work that we have completed to date requires an environmental permit, however, we must ensure timely repair of any damage done to the land during exploration.

We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all material government controls and regulations on the Lazy Claims.
 
Research and Development
 
We have not spent any money on research and development activities.
 
Employees
 
At the present time, we do not have any employees other than our sole officer who devotes his time as needed to our business and expects to devote 10 hours per week in 2019.
Legal Proceedings
 
We are not involved in any legal proceedings nor are we aware of any pending or threatened litigation against us. Neither our sole officer nor our directors are party to any legal proceeding or litigation. None of our directors or our sole officer has been convicted of a felony or misdemeanor relating to securities or performance in corporate office.
