 Item 1. Business
 Business Overview
 We are a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapeutics for endocrine diseases and endocrine-related tumors. Endocrine pathways function to maintain homeostasis and commonly use peptide hormones acting through G protein coupled receptors, or GPCRs, to regulate many aspects of physiology including growth, energy, metabolism, gastrointestinal function and stress responses. We have built a highly productive drug discovery and development organization with extensive expertise in endocrine GPCRs. We have discovered a pipeline of oral nonpeptide (small molecule) new chemical entities that target peptide GPCRs to treat a variety of rare endocrine diseases where treatment options have significant efficacy, safety and/or tolerability limitations. Our product candidates include paltusotine (formerly CRN00808), which is in clinical development for the treatment of acromegaly and neuroendocrine tumors complicated by carcinoid syndrome, CRN04777, which is in clinical development for congenital hyperinsulinism, or HI, and CRN04894, which is in clinical development for diseases of excess adrenocorticotrophic hormone, or ACTH, including Cushing’s disease and congenital adrenal hyperplasia, or CAH. We are advancing additional product candidates through preclinical discovery and development studies in parallel. Our vision is to build the leading endocrine company which consistently pioneers new therapeutics to help patients better control their disease and improve their daily lives.
We focus on the discovery and development of oral nonpeptide therapeutics that target peptide GPCRs with well understood biological functions, validated biomarkers and the potential to substantially improve the treatment of endocrine diseases and/or endocrine-related tumors. Our pipeline consists of the following product candidates:
Paltusotine (SST2 Agonist Program)
 Paltusotine, our lead product candidate, establishes a new class of oral selective nonpeptide somatostatin receptor type 2, or SST2, agonists designed for the treatment of acromegaly and neuroendocrine tumors, or NETs. Somatostatin is a neuropeptide hormone that broadly inhibits the secretion of other hormones, including growth hormone, or GH, from the pituitary gland. Acromegaly arises from a benign pituitary tumor that secretes excess GH that, in turn, causes excess secretion of insulin-like growth factor-1, or IGF-1, by the liver. This loss of homeostasis in the GH axis results in excess tissue growth and other adverse metabolic effects throughout the body. Approximately 27,000 people in the United States suffer from acromegaly, and depending on surgical success, we estimate that approximately 11,000 are candidates for chronic pharmacological intervention, of which somatostatin peptide analogs are the primary pharmacotherapy. NETs originate from
neuroendocrine cells commonly found in the gut, lung or pancreas. Typically, NETs are only diagnosed at a time of extensive metastatic disease and will often progress to liver failure. NETs are present in approximately 175,000 adults in the United States. Of these, it is estimated that approximately 33,000 patients have carcinoid syndrome, which occurs when the tumors secrete hormones or other chemical substances into the bloodstream that cause severe flushing or diarrhea, among other symptoms. While still an orphan disease, NETs are the second most common gastrointestinal malignancy after colon cancer. Most NETs overexpress SST2 receptors and injected depots of peptide somatostatin analogs have become the first-line standard of care for many NETs patients as detailed in National Comprehensive Cancer Network, or NCCN, guidelines. In 2022, branded somatostatin peptide drugs accounted for approximately $2.8 billion in global sales for the treatment of acromegaly, NETs and other uses. These drugs require painful monthly or daily injections and, in the case of somatostatin peptide drugs, often fail to fully control the disease in many acromegaly patients. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, has granted orphan drug designation for paltusotine for the treatment of acromegaly.
 To date, we have conducted multiple Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials and results have shown that paltusotine was generally well tolerated. In our ACROBAT Phase 2 program in acromegaly patients, including in our ACROBAT Advance long-term extension study, paltusotine maintained IGF-1 levels in patients previously treated with injected somatostatin receptor ligands, or SRLs, in which paltusotine lowered and maintained IGF-1 for up to 103 weeks at levels comparable to prior injected SRL therapy.
 We are currently conducting a Phase 3 development program for paltusotine in acromegaly which consists of two placebo-controlled clinical trials. The first of these, the PATHFNDR-1 trial, is designed as a double-blind, placebo-controlled, nine-month clinical trial of paltusotine in acromegaly patients with average IGF-1 levels less than or equal to 1.0 times the upper limit of normal, or ULN, and who are on stable doses of somatostatin receptor ligand monotherapy (octreotide LAR or lanreotide depot). We are also conducting a second study, the PATHFNDR-2 trial, which is designed as a double-blind, placebo-controlled, six-month clinical trial of acromegaly patients with elevated IGF-1 levels. The primary endpoint of both PATHFNDR studies will be the proportion of patients with IGF-1 ≤ 1.0 × ULN at the end of the treatment period on paltusotine as compared to placebo. Enrollment in PATHFNDR-1 was completed in 2022, and we expect topline data from the PATHFNDR-1 study in the third quarter of 2023. Enrollment in the PATHFNDR-2 study is ongoing and, based on our current projections, we expect topline data in the first quarter of 2024. We believe that, if successful, the two trials could support marketing applications for the use of paltusotine for all acromegaly patients who require pharmacotherapy, including untreated patients and those switching from other therapies, and we would plan to seek regulatory approval for paltusotine for the treatment of acromegaly in the United States with an anticipated submission of a New Drug Application, or NDA, in 2024.
 We are also conducting a Phase 2 trial to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of paltusotine in patients with NETs complicated by carcinoid syndrome. We expect data from this study in the second half of 2023.
 In February 2022, we entered into a license agreement with Sanwa Kagaku Kenkyusho Co., Ltd., or Sanwa, pursuant to which Sanwa has the exclusive right to develop and commercialize paltusotine in Japan, or the Sanwa License.
 CRN04894 (ACTH Antagonist)
 CRN04894 is our investigational, oral, nonpeptide product candidate designed to antagonize the ACTH receptor, intended for the treatment of diseases caused by excess ACTH, including Cushing’s disease and CAH. Cushing’s disease results from a pituitary tumor that secretes excess ACTH which, in turn, causes the downstream synthesis and over-secretion of cortisol by the adrenal glands. Cortisol is the body’s main stress hormone and excess amounts can cause significant increases in mortality and morbidity. CAH encompasses a set of disorders that are caused by genetic mutations that result in impaired cortisol synthesis. A lack of cortisol leads to a loss of feedback mechanisms and results in persistently high levels of ACTH, which, in turn, causes overstimulation of the adrenal cortex. The resulting adrenal hyperplasia and over-secretion of other steroids (particularly androgens) and steroid precursors can lead to a variety of effects from improper gonadal development to life-threatening dysregulation of mineralocorticoids. In the United States, there are an estimated 27,000 patients with CAH and over 11,000 patients with Cushing’s disease. Of the patients with CAH and Cushing’s disease, we estimate that 17,000 and 5,000 patients, respectively, are potential candidates for treatment with CRN04894.
We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 1 study of CRN04894 in healthy volunteers to assess the safety and tolerability of single and multiple doses of CRN04894. In addition, the study was designed to measure the effect of CRN04894 on suppression of cortisol, cortisol precursors, and adrenal androgens following exogenous ACTH stimulation. We announced positive topline data from the Phase 1 study. CRN04894 was well tolerated and demonstrated dose-dependent increases in CRN04894 plasma concentrations. We believe CRN04894 demonstrated pharmacologic proof-of-concept, as the Phase 1 results showed reductions of both basal cortisol and elevated cortisol following an ACTH challenge. All adverse events were considered mild to moderate and there were no serious adverse events.
In the fourth quarter of 2022, we entered into a Clinical Trial Agreement with the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, or NIDDK, of the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, to collaborate on a company-sponsored multiple-ascending dose exploratory trial of CRN04894 in ACTH dependent Cushing’s Syndrome, or ADCS. ADCS includes patients with either Cushing's disease or Ectopic ACTH Syndrome, or EAS. This open-label study is designed to evaluate safety and pharmacokinetics of increasing doses of CRN04894 in patients with ADCS as well as to measure 24-hour urinary-free cortisol and serum cortisol as indicators of efficacy. Study activities for this study have begun and data is expected from the study in 2024.
In January 2023, we submitted an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, to the FDA for the study of CRN04894 in CAH. In February 2023, we were notified that the IND was allowed to proceed, and we have initiated study activities for a Phase 2 study in CAH patients. This open-label Phase 2 study is designed to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of increasing doses of CRN04894. In addition, biomarkers, including serum androstenedione and 17 hydroxyprogesterone, will be measured as we seek to evaluate the potential efficacy of CRN04894. Data from this Phase 2 study is expected in 2024.
 CRN04777 (SST5 Agonist)
 CRN04777 is our investigational, oral, nonpeptide somatostatin receptor type 5, or SST5, agonist designed for the treatment of congenital hyperinsulinism, or HI. Congenital HI is a devastating rare genetic disease associated with dysregulated insulin production, in which excess insulin produces life-threatening hypoglycemia (low blood glucose) beginning at birth. This loss of homeostatic control of blood glucose levels can lead to seizures, developmental disorders, learning disabilities, coma and even death. Congenital HI occurs in approximately 1 in 25,000 to 50,000 new births in the United States. Approximately 2,200 patients in the United States are diagnosed with Congenital HI, and depending on surgical success, we estimate that approximately 1,500 are candidates for chronic pharmacological intervention. We have completed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 1 study of CRN04777 in healthy volunteers to assess the safety and tolerability of single and multiple doses of CRN04777. In addition, the study was designed to evaluate the potential mechanism of action of CRN04777 by measuring the suppression of insulin secretion in healthy volunteers following stimulation with either glucose or a sulfonylurea, agents that increase the secretion of insulin. We announced positive topline data from the single ascending dose, or SAD, cohorts and the multiple ascending dose, or MAD, cohorts and we believe CRN04777 demonstrated pharmacologic proof-of-concept, based on potent suppression of stimulated insulin observed in these subjects. The plasma exposure of CRN04777 suggested the drug was well absorbed with a half-life of approximately 40 hours, which we believe supports the potential for once daily administration in patients. All adverse events were considered mild or moderate and there were no serious adverse events. CRN04777 was well tolerated at single and multiple doses from 0.5 mg up to 120 mg and exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics for the same dose range. A dose-dependent reduction in glucose-induced insulin secretion was demonstrated with an intravenous glucose tolerance test in the SAD cohorts and a dose-dependent reversal of sulfonylurea-induced insulin secretion was seen in both the SAD and MAD cohorts. The sulfonylurea-induced insulin secretion model represents a pharmacologic analog of the hyperinsulinism that many patients experience.
Following the completion of the adult healthy volunteer study under a Clinical Trial Application in Germany, in October 2022, we submitted an IND to the FDA to initiate the first U.S. clinical study of CRN04777, which is designed to evaluate the compound in a pediatric population (ages 3 months to 12 years). In November 2022, the FDA informed us that the IND was placed on clinical hold and the proposed Phase 2 clinical study may not yet be initiated. We are in the process of collecting additional information and data to submit to the FDA, with the goal of being allowed to proceed with the Phase 2 study in patients with congenital HI.
 The FDA has granted rare pediatric disease designation for CRN04777 for the treatment of congenital HI. The European Medicines Agency, or EMA, has granted orphan drug designation for CRN04777 for the treatment of congenital HI and the United Kingdom Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, has granted CRN04777 an Innovation Passport for the treatment of congenital HI. We also expect CRN04777 can be broadly developed for the treatment of other diseases characterized by excess insulin secretion, including forms of syndromic hyperinsulinism, of which there are an estimated 1,700 patients in the United States.
 Parathyroid Hormone Antagonist
 We are developing antagonists of the parathyroid hormone, or PTH, receptor for the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism, or PHPT and humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy, or HHM, and other diseases of excess PTH. PTH regulates calcium and phosphate homeostasis in bone and kidney through activation of its receptor, PTHR1. Increased activation of PTHR1, either via PTH or PTH-related peptide (PTHrP, PTHLH) can lead to skeletal, renal, gastrointestinal, and neurological problems. Primary hyperparathyroidism arises from a small, benign tumor on one or more of the parathyroid glands, which results in over-secretion of PTH, leading to increased blood calcium levels, or hypercalcemia. Some patients experience no symptoms, and many can have surgery to remove the tumor and/or hyperactive gland(s), while some require management with medical therapy. Symptomatic PHPT is characterized by skeletal, renal, gastrointestinal, and neurological manifestations with increased mortality. HHM typically arises in patients with advanced-stage cancers. In cases
of HHM, over-secretion of PTHrP caused by the malignant tumor results in bone resorption and calcium reabsorption in the kidney, leading to hypercalcemia. We have identified investigational, orally available nonpeptide PTH antagonists that showed activity and drug-like properties in preclinical models. We are evaluating a subset of molecules to identify potential development candidates that we believe are suitable for evaluation in human clinical trials, and we expect to select a development candidate in 2023.
Radionetics Oncology, Inc.
 On October 18, 2021, we, together with 5AM Ventures and Frazier Healthcare Partners, announced the formation of Radionetics Oncology, Inc., or Radionetics. Radionetics aims to develop a deep pipeline of novel, targeted, nonpeptide radiopharmaceuticals for the treatment of a broad range of oncology indications. In connection with the formation of Radionetics, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with Radionetics, or the Radionetics License, granting Radionetics an exclusive world-wide license to our technology for the development of radiotherapeutics and related radio-imaging agents in exchange for a majority equity stake in Radionetics, a warrant to obtain additional shares of common stock of Radionetics, potential sales milestones in excess of $1.0 billion and single-digit royalties on net sales.
Research Discovery
 Patients with many other debilitating endocrine diseases await new therapeutic options, and we are continuously evaluating where to next deploy our drug discovery efforts. We plan to continue to expand our drug discovery efforts and leverage our expertise in the evaluation of additional conditions including polycystic kidney disease, metabolic diseases (including diabetes and obesity) and Graves’ Disease (including Thyroid Eye Disease), among other indications. All of our product candidates have been discovered, characterized and developed internally and are the subject of composition of matter patent applications. We have retained worldwide rights to commercialize our product candidates and do not have any royalty obligations except with respect to the exclusive right to develop and commercialize paltusotine in Japan pursuant to the Sanwa License, and the exclusive right to our radiotherapeutics technology pursuant to the Radionetics License.
 Our strategy
Our objective is to transform the treatment of endocrine diseases and endocrine-related tumors by creating a diversified portfolio of novel therapeutics that will advance the standard of care. To achieve this objective, we are pursuing the following strategy:
•Focus on endocrine diseases and endocrine-related tumors with significant unmet medical need. There are numerous endocrine diseases and endocrine-related tumors for which currently available pharmacological therapies (when they exist) have significant limitations in efficacy, safety and/or tolerability. Patients living with these diseases often experience significant morbidity, mortality and/or poor quality of life. We are focused on discovering, developing, and commercializing orally available therapies for multiple indications across endocrinology to advance the standard of care for these patients. 
 •Rapidly advance multiple product candidates in parallel to clinical proof-of-concept and late-stage development by targeting diseases that require relatively small trials and employ validated biomarkers as clinical endpoints. Phase 1 clinical trials for endocrine diseases and endocrine-related tumors can often measure predictive biomarkers in healthy volunteers and lower the technical risk by providing a predictive measure of efficacy early in clinical development. Clinical trials in these indications often enroll relatively small numbers of trial subjects and use validated biomarkers as registration endpoints, which we believe will allow us to efficiently develop multiple clinical programs in parallel. 
 •Continue to expand our therapeutic pipeline for endocrine diseases by leveraging the capabilities of our experienced discovery team in the area of peptide hormone GPCRs. Our discovery team has significant expertise in understanding and creating product candidates to influence the dynamic behavior of GPCRs and has developed a number of proprietary methods, techniques and tools that we believe will enable us to efficiently and reliably evaluate newly synthesized molecules. We employ an iterative strategy where compounds are designed, synthesized, and rapidly characterized for pharmacologic and pharmaceutical properties. This approach has led to our current pipeline, and we will continue to invest in creating additional product candidates acting at this important class of targets. Peptide hormone GPCRs regulate many aspects of physiology and are attractive drug targets for treating a broad range of diseases. There are more than 80 known peptide hormones acting at more than 120 known different receptors. With each of our drug discovery programs, our goal is to specifically tailor a product candidate with pharmacologic and pharmaceutical properties highly optimized for its interaction with its specific GPCR target that we anticipate will translate to downstream benefits in our chosen therapeutic applications. 
 •Retain significant development and commercial rights to our product candidates. We intend to commercialize our product candidates if approved by regulators. In February 2022, we entered into the Sanwa License pursuant to which 

Sanwa has the exclusive right to commercialize paltusotine in Japan. In the future, we may enter into additional distribution or licensing arrangements for commercialization rights for other product candidates.
 •Maintain an entrepreneurial, scientifically rigorous, and inclusive corporate culture where employees are fully engaged and strive to bring improved therapeutic options to patients. The patients we seek to treat currently only have options with significant drawbacks and often limited efficacy, safety and/or tolerability. We are passionate about developing new pharmacological therapies to help these patients better control their diseases and to reduce the impact of these diseases on their daily lives. We believe that building a successful and sustainable endocrine company requires not just specific expertise in multiple areas of drug discovery, development, and commercialization, but a team-oriented culture that integrates and harnesses the creative energy, scientific insights and enthusiasm of the entire organization. 
 The endocrine system
Overview
The endocrine system regulates most of the body’s physiological activities through the actions of hormones, which are chemical and biochemical messengers secreted from different organs that influence growth, gastrointestinal function, maturation and development, reproduction, stress, metabolism and nearly all aspects of homeostasis. Hormones are structurally variable and can be monoamines, steroids, amino acids, peptides, or larger proteins. The endocrine system includes, among other glands and organs, the pituitary gland, hypothalamus, pancreas, adrenal gland, thyroid and parathyroid, ovaries and testes, as well as specialized enteroendocrine cells.
Hormonal secretion is complex, and the body employs several mechanisms to exert positive and negative feedback control to maintain homeostasis. For example, the pituitary gland, which is located behind the eyes at the base of the brain, is sometimes referred to as “the master endocrine gland” because it regulates multiple endocrine systems. Positive and negative control of pituitary hormonal secretion is often dictated by the adjacent hypothalamus, which integrates feedback responses from other areas of the body, including the brain. In the case of GH, its synthesis and secretion are stimulated by growth hormone-releasing hormone, or GHRH, and inhibited by somatostatin, which are both hypothalamic peptides. Another example is the pancreas that secretes insulin and glucagon, which lower and raise blood glucose levels, respectively. Insulin and glucagon secretion are both inhibited by somatostatin, which is also locally produced in and secreted by specific cells in the pancreas.
Hormonal dysregulation can arise from endocrine organ defects, including injury, inflammation, genetic abnormalities, or the growth of tumors derived from endocrine cells. These insults can result in the under-secretion or over-secretion of one or more hormones, disrupting homeostasis and causing disease. For example, several serious clinical disorders, including acromegaly and Cushing’s disease, result from pituitary tumors secreting excess hormones. In the pancreas, genetic defects or cellular dysfunction can give rise to disorders of under-secretion or over-secretion of pancreatic hormones (e.g., hyperinsulinemia).
Peptide hormone GPCRs
Various GPCRs are expressed in every type of cell in the body and their function is to transmit signals from outside the cell across the membrane to signaling pathways within the cell, between cells and between organ systems. Because of these critical actions, the GPCR superfamily is the largest and single most important family of drug targets as highlighted by the large number of approved therapeutics targeting this class. However, most currently available GPCR-targeting drugs act at receptors for which the native ligands are small molecules, such as histamine, adrenaline, and neurotransmitters.
Most peptide hormones bind selectively to specific receptors located on the surface of cells in the target tissue. Receptors for peptide hormones are often GPCRs, which play a central role in many biological processes and are linked to a wide range of disease areas. There are more than 80 known peptide hormones acting at more than 120 known different receptors. Historically, it was assumed that small molecules could not replicate or compete with the complex interactions between peptides and their cognate GPCRs. As such, most drugs developed for peptide GPCRs have been and continue to be peptides themselves, which present manufacturing and formulation difficulties and force patients to undergo frequent injections because peptides generally are not orally bioavailable. We believe our approach to developing novel small molecule product candidates that uniquely engage peptide hormone GPCRs will enable us to generate orally bioavailable, and potentially more selective, effective and better tolerated therapeutics for patients.
The somatostatin receptor family of peptide GPCRs is an illustrative example of the complex and subtle control inherent in endocrine biology and peptide hormone physiology. The peptide hormone somatostatin, which was first isolated over 40 years ago, is produced by a variety of cell types and has pleiotropic effects throughout the body, many of which are related to the inhibition of secretion of other hormones or neurotransmitters, and selective activation of this activity has made somatostatin agonism a well-established, commercially validated mechanism. These effects are mediated by five different somatostatin receptor proteins (SST1, SST2, SST3, SST4, and SST5), which lower levels of cyclic adenosine
monophosphate, or cAMP, a key intracellular signaling molecule regulated by GPCR activation. Each of these receptors is expressed in different subsets of tissues. For example, SST2 is the most widely expressed subtype in NETs and is the dominant receptor by which GH secretion is suppressed in the pituitary. The SST5 receptor is expressed by pancreatic islet cells where its activation potently inhibits insulin secretion.
GPCRs were originally thought to function as simple on-off switches responding to hormones and neurotransmitters but have since been shown to exhibit complex and diverse molecular and cellular behaviors. Many lines of structural and mechanistic research demonstrate that distinct signaling cascades and feedback mechanisms create multi-dimensional pathways with distinct physiological responses. These different responses are based on ligand binding kinetics, receptor regulation and trafficking (Figure 1). Some transduce signals into the cell interior to regulate various cellular functions. Other responses attenuate hormonal signals to prevent overstimulation and include receptor internalization (a removal of the GPCR from the cell surface, which makes it unavailable for external ligands), desensitization and downregulation. The capacity of a GPCR ligand to preferentially affect one of these pathways, such as G-protein signaling, over others, such as receptor downregulation, is termed biased agonism We believe our understanding of these different signaling pathways enables us to develop oral, small molecule product candidates that not only are highly selective for specific receptor subtypes but also are further custom-tailored to activate specific GPCR properties and ultimately improve patient outcomes.
Our product candidates
All of our product candidates have been discovered and developed internally and we have retained global rights to commercialize our product candidates and have no royalty or licensing obligations. The following table summarizes our product candidate pipeline.



Somatostatin receptor type 2 agonists for the treatment of acromegaly and neuroendocrine tumors
 Our lead product, paltusotine, is an oral selective nonpeptide SST2 agonist in clinical development for the treatment of acromegaly. The FDA granted orphan drug designation for paltusotine for the treatment of acromegaly. Results from our Phase 1 trial of paltusotine demonstrated initial clinical proof-of-concept based on observed suppression of GH and IGF-1 secretion in healthy volunteers. In October 2020, we announced positive topline results from the ACROBAT Edge and Evolve Phase 2 trials in acromegaly. The prespecified primary endpoint in Edge was achieved, showing that once daily oral paltusotine maintained IGF-1 levels at Week 13 in acromegaly patients who were switched from an injected somatostatin receptor ligand depot of either octreotide or lanreotide monotherapy. We are currently conducting our Phase 3 program of paltusotine in acromegaly patients and topline data is expected in the second half of 2023. We are also conducting a Phase 2 trial to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of paltusotine in patients with NETs complicated by carcinoid syndrome. We expect topline data from this study in the second half of 2023. In February 2022, we entered into the Sanwa License pursuant to which Sanwa has the exclusive right to develop and commercialize paltusotine in Japan.
 Acromegaly disease background
Acromegaly is typically caused by a pituitary tumor that secretes excess GH. Pituitary tumors are generally benign adenomas that, in addition to GH secretion, also express membrane receptors for somatostatin. Increased GH secretion results in excess downstream secretion of IGF-1 from the liver. GH and IGF-1 promote tissue growth and have other metabolic effects throughout the body.
The symptoms of acromegaly include abnormal growth of hands and feet and changes in shape of the bones that result in alteration of facial features. Overgrowth of bone and cartilage and thickening of tissue can lead to arthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, joint aches, enlarged lips, nose and tongue, deepening of voice due to enlarged vocal cords, sleep apnea due to obstruction of airways and enlargement of the heart, liver and other organs. Additional symptoms can include thick, coarse, oily skin, skin tags, excessive sweating and skin odor, fatigue and weakness, headaches, goiter, decreased libido, menstrual abnormalities in women and erectile dysfunction in men. As the tumor grows, it can impinge on the nerves in the optic chiasm leading to visual problems and potentially vision loss. Compression of the surrounding normal pituitary tissues can decrease production of other pituitary hormones, resulting in hypopituitarism. Acromegaly patients experience increased mortality rates, principally due to cardiovascular diseases (diabetes, hypertension), respiratory disease and cerebrovascular diseases.
Acromegaly is often suspected when the patient exhibits enlargement of extremities and an alteration of facial features. Pituitary tumors are also often found during clinical workup for severe headaches, vision changes or incidentally on cranial imaging initiated for other reasons. Elevation of serum IGF-1 levels confirms the suspicion of acromegaly, but a formal diagnosis requires lack of suppression of serum GH levels in response to an oral glucose tolerance test. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computerized tomography (CT) scan of the pituitary is then used to locate the tumor, determine its size and assess the potential for surgical intervention. It is estimated that there are approximately 27,000 patients in the United States with acromegaly, 11,000 of whom we estimate are candidates for pharmacotherapy.

Current acromegaly treatments and limitations
The major goals of treatment are to reduce serum GH and normalize IGF-1 levels, ameliorate symptoms and relieve any pressure resulting from the tumor. Surgical removal of the pituitary tumor is the first treatment option and often results in rapid improvement of symptoms. Surgery can be curative if the tumor is small and accessible enough to be fully resected. However, many acromegaly patients turn to pharmacological treatments if they are not candidates for surgery or surgery was unsuccessful. Somatostatin analogs octreotide (marketed as Sandostatin) and lanreotide (marketed as Somatuline) are selective for SST2 receptors and are the preferred first-line pharmacologic treatments. However, these peptides leave many patients inadequately controlled. For example, a meta-analysis published in 2014 by the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism showed that approximately 50% of over 4,000 acromegaly patients treated with octreotide or lanreotide failed to achieve biochemical control. Pegvisomant (marketed as Somavert) is a daily injectable GH receptor antagonist and is generally used in patients resistant to or intolerant of somatostatin analogs. Pasireotide (marketed as Signifor) is a less selective SST receptor agonist that is also used and has activity toward SST5, SST3 and SST2 receptors. However, pasireotide treatment leads to an increase in fasting plasma glucose levels in patients within the first two or three weeks of treatment and a pronounced shift to pre-diabetes and diabetes (as judged by HbA1c levels) within six months due to its insulin-suppressing SST5 activity. Orally administered dopamine agonists, such as cabergoline, are also used, but do not achieve hormone normalization in most patients. For this reason, dopamine agonists are usually used as adjunct to somatostatin analogs. While these currently approved drugs reduce the disease burden, many patients still report acromegaly symptoms despite treatment, particularly at the end of the monthly dosing cycle. In 2020, octreotide capsules (marketed as MYCAPSSA) received marketing approval in the United States for long-term maintenance treatment in acromegaly patients who have responded to and tolerated treatment with octreotide or lanreotide.
 Currently available therapies for acromegaly are primarily peptide drugs that require injection, making them both painful and inconvenient. Octreotide and pasireotide are typically a monthly intramuscular injection, lanreotide a monthly deep subcutaneous injection and pegvisomant a daily subcutaneous injection. Patients report pain, swelling and bruising both at the time of injection and for days following injections. In addition, octreotide, lanreotide and pasireotide labels require injections by a trained healthcare provider and are therefore inconvenient for patients. Finally, the reconstitution of octreotide and pasireotide can be complex and prone to error for healthcare providers.
 We believe that a once-daily oral nonpeptide somatostatin agonist that reduces excess GH secretion and normalizes IGF-1 levels in acromegaly patients would represent a major clinical advance by eliminating painful injections and reducing the frequency of physician office visits. Additionally, we believe it should allow physicians to more quickly determine optimal dosing regimens compared to existing depot therapies.
Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) background
NETs arise from cells of the enteroendocrine system in the gastrointestinal tract (approximately 70% of cases) but can also arise from neuroendocrine cells in the lung (approximately 25% of cases) or, more rarely, the pancreas. These tumors are usually slow growing and often initially asymptomatic. Therefore, many patients are only diagnosed at a time of extensive metastatic disease, and these patients can progress to liver failure. In approximately 19% of cases, these tumors are associated with excess secretion of serotonin resulting in carcinoid syndrome, which is characterized by severe diarrhea and flushing. NETs are present in approximately 175,000 adults in the United States, of which it is estimated that approximately 33,000 patients have carcinoid syndrome. While still an orphan disease, NETs are the second most common gastrointestinal malignancy after colon cancer.
Current neuroendocrine tumor treatments and limitations
Most NETs overexpress SST2 receptors and injected depots of peptide somatostatin analogs have become a standard of care for patients with carcinoid syndrome. While somatostatin analogs have been historically indicated primarily for patients with carcinoid syndrome, there is an evolving understanding of the positive impact of somatostatin analog treatment on the broader NETs patient population. For example, lanreotide was approved for the treatment of gastroenteropancreatic NETs based on a long-term study that showed significant improvement in progression free survival. However, many patients eventually become increasingly resistant to somatostatin analogs requiring increased dosage of depot preparations or use short-acting analogs as an add-on therapy. In 2017, the serotonin synthesis inhibitor, telotristat, was approved for the treatment of carcinoid syndrome diarrhea in combination with somatostatin analog (SSA) therapy in adults inadequately controlled by SSA therapy.
The overexpression of SST2 in NETs is also the basis for somatostatin targeted radioimaging of the tumors for diagnosis and staging. Peptide somatostatin analogs modified to incorporate a chelating agent can use their SST2 binding activity to concentrate radioisotopes in tumor tissue that can then be imaged using positron-emission tomography (PET). More recently, this approach has been adapted to deliver the beta particle emitter 177Lu for anti-tumor activity. A drug using this mechanism, Lutathera, significantly improved progression free survival and led to a substantial reduction in the risk of disease
10

progression or death when added onto octreotide LAR therapy compared to a double dose of octreotide LAR, in a Phase 3 trial in NET patients who had failed on somatostatin analog therapy. Lutathera was approved in 2018 for the treatment of somatostatin receptor-positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.
 Paltusotine overview and clinical development
Paltusotine, our lead product candidate, pioneers a new class of oral selective nonpeptide SST2 agonists designed for the treatment of acromegaly and is the first agent in its class with reported clinical results. It is designed to reduce excess GH secretion from benign pituitary tumors and normalize IGF-1 levels in patients with acromegaly. In vitro pharmacology studies demonstrated that paltusotine potently stimulated SST2 receptor activity as measured by a decrease in cAMP accumulation in cells expressing the human SST2 receptor (EC50=0.25 nM, the concentration that achieves 50% cAMP inhibition). Analogous experiments using the other SST receptor subtypes showed paltusotine’s selectivity for SST2 was 4,000 times greater than the other SST receptor subtypes.
In addition to somatostatin receptor-directed pharmacology, paltusotine showed little off-target activity in a variety of assays for other GPCRs, enzymes, ion channels and transporters. Based on further in vivo studies in rats and dogs, paltusotine suppressed GH and IGF-1 consistent with its mechanism of action. We conducted 28-day good laboratory practice, or GLP, toxicity studies in rats and dogs and identified no dose-limiting toxicities, which supported moving paltusotine into human clinical trials.
We began a Phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in late 2017 to assess the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of paltusotine in 99 healthy human volunteers. This trial was performed at a single center in Melbourne, Australia. Subjects in the single ascending dose, or SAD, arm (up to 20 mg) were also evaluated for the ability of paltusotine to suppress GH secretion. Because GH secretion is pulsatile during the day, subjects in the first five SAD cohorts were given an intravenous bolus of GHRH (50 µg) to ensure a reliable window of high GH secretion. These GH responses were evaluated on day -1 (the day prior to dosing) and again on day 1 (the day of dosing either paltusotine or placebo). The ability of paltusotine to suppress serum IGF-1 was evaluated in the multiple ascending dose, or MAD, cohorts.
 Administration of GHRH on day -1 resulted in a rapid surge of serum GH that lasted approximately 2 hours. In contrast to day -1, the presence of paltusotine in plasma strongly suppressed (approximately 92%) stimulated GH secretion, consistent with the compound’s activity as an SST2 agonist. This response was dose dependent. The first-generation paltusotine capsule achieved approximately 75% of the total plasma exposure (area under the curve, or AUC) of the same dose administered as an oral solution to fasted subjects. However, when the capsule was administered with a standardized high fat meal, plasma AUC was reduced by approximately 83%, suggesting that the first-generation capsule formulation should be taken under fasted conditions. In the drug-drug interaction cohort, repeated dosing of paltusotine resulted in no change in the exposure of the sensitive CYP3A4 reporter midazolam, suggesting that paltusotine is not likely to cause drug interactions by inhibiting the metabolism of other drugs that are primarily metabolized by the major CYP enzymes in the liver.
In the MAD arm, subjects were dosed with paltusotine for seven days (5 mg cohort) or ten days (10-30 mg cohorts) and serum IGF-1 levels were measured each day. In both acromegaly patients and healthy volunteers, sustained suppression of GH release results in lowering of serum IGF-1 levels. However, in contrast to the rapid effects of the GH response, IGF-1 levels are known to decrease more gradually and require several days of exposure to somatostatin agonists to produce an observable effect. As paltusotine concentrations reached steady state, serum IGF-1 concentrations began to decline. This decline reached steady state in approximately seven days. Of note, IGF-1 remained suppressed for several days after the final dose but began to recover as paltusotine plasma concentrations fell.
Paltusotine exhibited a dose-dependent increase in exposure in the dose range of 5 mg to 30 mg and a terminal elimination half-life of 42 to 50 hours, consistent with potential for once daily administration. Suppression of IGF-1 levels for the 10 mg, 20 mg and 30 mg cohorts was similar indicating that the 10 mg dose achieved a maximal response. This degree of IGF-1 suppression by paltusotine was similar to that observed for peptide somatostatin analogs (octreotide, lanreotide) in previously reported healthy volunteer studies. Concentrations of somatostatin analogs in healthy volunteers that result in this level of suppression in healthy volunteers are comparable to the trough concentrations in patients on the highest approved dose. This suggests that drug concentrations that result in maximal suppression of IGF-1 in healthy volunteers translates to meaningful suppression of IGF-1 in acromegaly patients.
The safety and tolerability of paltusotine in the trial was generally consistent with that of approved peptide somatostatin analogs. In the trial, paltusotine resulted in mild gastrointestinal disorders (such as abdominal pain, flatulence, abdominal distension, and diarrhea) in approximately 30% of subjects and mild elevations of pancreatic enzymes in approximately 10% of subjects. One subject experienced moderate abdominal pain after a single 40 mg dose. Additional adverse events included headache, dizziness and cardiac rhythm abnormalities (including nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, or NSVT) which were not dose dependent and also observed in placebo subjects and/or prior to dosing. One serious adverse event of moderate
NSVT was observed following a single 1.25 mg dose and was considered unlikely to be related to paltusotine. Based on the conclusions from this Phase 1 clinical study, we selected 10 mg as the initial dose for our Phase 2 trials.
Following our Phase 1 study, we conducted global Phase 2 clinical trials with paltusotine in acromegaly patients. The first of these, Evolve, was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in patients whose IGF-1 levels were biochemically controlled by octreotide or lanreotide monotherapy. We also conducted a second, open-label exploratory trial, Edge, to evaluate the effects of paltusotine on patients whose IGF-1 levels were not biochemically controlled by octreotide or lanreotide alone. We are also conducting the Advance trial, which is a Phase 2 open label, long term extension study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of paltusotine in patients who completed the Evolve or Edge trials.
We announced positive topline results from the ACROBAT Phase 2 program in acromegaly in October 2020. The prespecified primary endpoint in Edge was achieved, showing that once daily oral paltusotine maintained insulin-like growth factor-1, or IGF-1, levels at Week 13 in acromegaly patients who were switched from an injected SRL, depot of either octreotide or lanreotide monotherapy [change in IGF-1 = -0.034 (-0.107, 0.107), median (IQR)]. There were 25 patients enrolled in this prespecified primary analysis population (Group 1). During the four-week washout period after the 13-week treatment period, Group 1 patients showed a meaningful (>20%) and prompt (within two weeks) rise in IGF-1 levels from baseline, which provided evidence regarding the magnitude of therapeutic activity of oral paltusotine in acromegaly patients. Edge also enrolled an additional 22 patients into four different exploratory populations (Groups 2-5).
 As previously announced, the enrollment in Evolve was terminated early, enabling data to be available for the end of Phase 2 regulatory interactions on the Edge study. The reduced sample size did not allow for meaningful statistical comparisons between groups in the randomized withdrawal period. Data from these patients on lower doses of paltusotine were included in the post-hoc dose response analyses in combination with data from patients in the Edge study, most of whom received the higher doses.
 Post-hoc analyses of patients in Edge (Group 1; n=25) and Evolve (n=13) were conducted to explore the effect of paltusotine dose on IGF-1 suppression. These analyses provided evidence of a dose response across the dose range of 10 to 40 mg. Dose-dependent results were observed when evaluating the effect on IGF-1 levels from: 1) switching from injectable SRL to paltusotine, and 2) withdrawing paltusotine during the washout phase. These data and ongoing exposure response analysis has informed the selection of doses to be included the Phase 3 program.
 Paltusotine was generally well tolerated among the 60 ACROBAT participants (including both Edge and Evolve), which is consistent with prior clinical findings in healthy volunteers. There were no discontinuations due to drug-related adverse events, no safety signals seen in clinical laboratory analyses, no treatment-related SAEs, and no patients required rescue treatments with standard acromegaly medications during treatment. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (>10%) included: headache, arthralgia, fatigue, peripheral swelling, paresthesia, and hyperhidrosis.
 Based on feedback from our interactions with the FDA and other regulators, we have defined our Phase 3 development program which consists of two placebo-controlled clinical trials. We are conducting PATHFNDR-1, which is designed as a double-blind, placebo-controlled, nine-month clinical trial of paltusotine in acromegaly patients with average IGF-1 levels less than or equal to 1.0 times the upper limit of normal, or ULN, and who are on stable doses of SRL monotherapy (octreotide LAR or lanreotide depot). The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients with IGF-1 ≤ 1.0 × ULN at the end of a nine-month treatment period on paltusotine as compared to placebo. We are also conducting a second study, PATHFNDR-2, which is designed as a double-blind, placebo-controlled, twenty-four-week trial in acromegaly patients with elevated IGF-1 levels, who are untreated. Three groups of subjects will be enrolled including subjects with no prior medical therapy (Group 1), subjects who last received medical therapy at least 4 months prior to screening (Group 2), and subjects who are controlled on octreotide or lanreotide but agree to washout prior to beginning study treatment (Group 3). Groups 1 and 2 constitute Stratum 1 and Group 3 constitutes Stratum 2. The study population will be stratified to ensure equivalent active treatment versus placebo allocations in each stratum. Approximately 76 subjects are planned to be enrolled based on the assumption that there will be an equal number of subjects in each stratum. If enrollment in Stratum 2 is below a prespecified threshold, the protocol allows for an increase in the sample size to ensure sufficient statistical power to detect a difference between the active and placebo groups. The primary endpoint in PATHFNDR-2 is also the proportion of patients with IGF-1 ≤ 1.0 × ULN at the end of the treatment period on paltusotine as compared to placebo. A new tablet formulation of paltusotine is being used in both trials. When evaluated in a Phase 1 pharmacokinetic healthy volunteer study, the tablet formulation had a reduced fasting requirement compared to the capsule formulation that was used in prior trials and dose proportional exposure was observed up to 80 mg. Enrollment in PATHFNDR-1 was completed in 2022 and we expect topline data from the PATHFNDR-1 study in the third quarter of 2023. Enrollment in the PATHFNDR-2 study is ongoing and, based on our current projections, we expect topline data in the first quarter of 2024. We believe that, if successful, these trials could support marketing applications of paltusotine for all acromegaly patients who require pharmacotherapy, including untreated patients and those switching from other therapies, and we would plan to seek regulatory approval for paltusotine for
the treatment of acromegaly in the United States with an anticipated submission of a New Drug Application, or NDA, in 2024.
We are also conducting an open-label Phase 2 trial to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of paltusotine in patients with NETs complicated by carcinoid syndrome. We expect data from this study in the second half of 2023.
 ACTH antagonists for the treatment of Cushing’s disease, Congenital, Adrenal Hyperplasia, and other diseases of ACTH excess
 We are developing, CRN04894, an investigational, orally available nonpeptide ACTH antagonist, designed to block the action of adrenocorticotrophic hormone, or ACTH. CRN04894 is intended for the treatment of diseases caused by excess ACTH. CRN04894 is currently in development for Cushing’s disease and CAH. We have completed a Phase 1 study of CRN04894 in healthy volunteers, initiated clinical studies in patients with Cushing's disease and initiated study activities for a Phase 2 study in patients with CAH.
 Background on diseases of ACTH excess
Cushing’s syndrome was first described by Harvey Cushing over a century ago and results from a prolonged exposure to elevated levels of glucocorticoids, particularly cortisol. Common signs include growth of fat pads (above the collarbone and on back of the neck), abdominal obesity, facial fat accumulation, excessive sweating, dilation of capillaries, thinning of the skin, muscle weakness, hirsutism, depression/anxiety, hypertension, osteoporosis, insulin resistance and hyperglycemia, heart disease and a range of other metabolic disturbances resulting in high morbidity. While excessive synthetic steroid administration or adrenal tumors can cause ACTH-independent forms of the disease, ACTH dependent Cushing’s syndrome (which includes Cushing’s disease and Ectopic ACTH Syndrome) is the most common form accounting for 60-80% of all cases. Cushing’s disease is caused by tumors of pituitary corticotroph cells that secrete excess ACTH. EAS is caused by tumors outside the pituitary gland that secrete excess ACTH.
 Cushing’s disease is an orphan indication with a prevalence of approximately 11,000 patients in the United States. It presents more commonly in women, and usually between 30 and 50 years of age. Cushing’s disease often takes many years to diagnose and may well be under-diagnosed in the general population as many of its symptoms such as lethargy, depression, obesity, hypertension, hirsutism and menstrual irregularity can be incorrectly attributed to other more common disorders.
CAH encompasses a set of disorders that are caused by genetic mutations that result in impaired cortisol synthesis. This lack of cortisol leads to a breakdown of feedback mechanisms and results in persistently high levels of ACTH, which in turn causes overstimulation of the adrenal cortex. The resulting adrenal hyperplasia and over-secretion of other steroids (particularly androgens) and steroid precursors can lead to a variety of effects from improper gonadal development to life-threatening dysregulation of mineralocorticoids. CAH is an orphan indication with a prevalence of approximately 27,000 patients in the United States.
 EAS is a rare disorder that results from non-pituitary tumors that secrete excessive amounts of ACTH. The supraphysiological degree of ACTH secretion in EAS can vary with effects that range from cushingoid to acutely life-threatening. Treatment options for EAS are limited, with the first goal being surgical removal of the tumors, if possible. If surgery is not an option, medical therapy may be used to block cortisol production. And in some cases, adrenalectomy is required if the tumor cannot be located and medical therapy does not fully block the cortisol production.
 Current treatments and limitations
As with acromegaly, first-line therapy for Cushing’s disease is surgery to remove the pituitary tumor if possible. Pharmacological therapy is required when surgery is delayed, contraindicated or unsuccessful. Adrenal enzyme inhibitors (e.g., metyrapone and ketoconazole) prevent the synthesis of cortisol and can improve symptoms but suffer from mechanistic side effects as a result of accumulation of precursor steroids and the resulting lack of negative feedback. For example, metyrapone is associated with hirsutism in women and patients must be monitored carefully to avoid hypoadrenalism. Ketoconazole often requires progressively increasing dosage to maintain disease control, but this is ultimately limited by the hepatotoxicity of the drug. In addition, it is a potent inhibitor of one of the most important drug metabolizing enzymes in the liver, CYP3A4, resulting in the potential for negative drug-interactions as a side effect. Mifepristone, a potent glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, is approved for control of hyperglycemia in Cushing’s syndrome, but is difficult to titrate and has significant liabilities due to its potent anti-progesterone activity. The somatostatin analog, pasireotide, inhibits ACTH secretion, but in a recently published study, only 15-26% of patients in a Phase 3 trial achieved normalization of urinary free cortisol while 73% of patients experienced a hyperglycemia-related adverse event due to the compound’s potent inhibition of insulin secretion. Osilodrostat, a cortisol synthesis inhibitor, received marketing approval in 2020 in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with Cushing’s disease for whom pituitary surgery is not an option or has not been curative.
 The current treatment algorithm for CAH consists of lifelong daily glucocorticoid supplementation which attempts to address the body's inability to synthesize cortisol as well as its over-production of androgens that results from misregulated
steroidogenesis. The inability to precisely dose glucocorticoids can often lead to enduring cycles of over- or under-treatment. Under-treatment can result in adrenal crisis and intramuscular stress doses of glucocorticoid for acute illness are common. CAH patients have a two-fold risk of bone fractures compared to the general population and commonly suffer from hypercholesterolemia, insulin resistance, and hypertension. Compared to the general population, CAH patients have a diminished life expectancy of 7 years, and more than 20% of CAH patients will die of a condition complicated by adrenal crisis. Therefore, we believe a significant unmet medical need exists for improved agents to treat both Cushing’s disease and CAH.
 Preclinical development
ACTH acts through a peptide GPCR called the melanocortin type 2 receptor, or MC2R, that is specifically expressed in the adrenal gland. Activation of MC2 by ACTH results in increased synthesis of cAMP, enhanced synthesis and secretion of cortisol and hypertrophy of adrenal cells. CRN04894 is a potent, selective nonpeptide antagonist of MC2R designed to block ACTH action and prevent its excessive stimulation of the adrenal gland in Cushing’s disease and CAH patients. In vivo proof-of-concept is demonstrated by CRN04894’s capacity to block corticosterone secretion in a rodent ACTH-challenge model, which mimics aspects of Cushing’s disease.
Clinical development
We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 1 study of CRN04894 in healthy volunteers to assess the safety and tolerability of single and multiple doses of CRN04894. In addition, the study was designed to measure the effect of CRN04894 on suppression of cortisol, cortisol precursors, and adrenal androgens following exogenous ACTH stimulation. We announced positive topline data from the Phase 1 study, and CRN04894 was well tolerated and demonstrated dose-dependent increases in CRN04894 plasma concentrations. We believe CRN04894 demonstrated pharmacologic proof-of-concept, as the Phase 1 results showed reductions of both basal cortisol and elevated cortisol following an ACTH challenge. All adverse events were considered mild to moderate and there were no serious adverse events.
 In the fourth quarter of 2022, we entered into a Clinical Trial Agreement with the NIDDK of the NIH to collaborate on a company-sponsored multiple-ascending dose exploratory trial of CRN04894 in ADCS, including patients with Cushing's disease or EAS. This open-label study is designed to evaluate safety and pharmacokinetics of increasing doses of CRN04894 in patients with ADCS as well as to measure 24-hour urinary-free cortisol and serum cortisol as indicators of efficacy. Study activities have begun and data is expected from the study in 2024.
In January 2023, we submitted an IND to the FDA for the study of CRN04894 in CAH. In February 2023, we were notified that the IND was allowed to proceed, and we have initiated study activities for a Phase 2 study in CAH patients. This open-label Phase 2 study is designed to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of increasing doses of CRN04894. In addition, biomarkers, including serum androstenedione and 17 hydroxyprogesterone, will be measured as we seek to evaluate the potential efficacy of CRN04894. Data from this Phase 2 study is expected in 2024.
 Somatostatin receptor type 5 agonists for the treatment of hyperinsulinism
We are developing CRN04777, an investigational, oral, selective nonpeptide SST5 receptor agonist that is designed to inhibit the excess insulin secretion associated with congenital and acquired disorders of hyperinsulinism, with our initial focus on congenital HI. CRN04777 is intended to act at the SST5 receptor, which is independent of many of the mutations that cause congenital HI and, therefore, should allow CRN04777 to be broadly applicable to congenital HI patients across all underlying mutations. We have completed a Phase 1 study of CRN04777 in healthy volunteers to assess the safety and tolerability of single and multiple doses of CRN04777. Following the completion of the adult healthy volunteer study under a Clinical Trial Application in Germany, in October 2022, we submitted an IND to the FDA to initiate the first U.S. clinical study of CRN04777, which is designed to evaluate the compound in a pediatric population (ages 3 months - 12 years). In November 2022, the FDA informed us that the IND was placed on clinical hold and the proposed Phase 2 clinical study may not yet be initiated. We are in the process of collecting additional information and data to submit to the FDA, with the goal of being allowed to proceed with the Phase 2 study in patients with congenital HI.
The FDA has granted rare pediatric disease designation for CRN04777 for the treatment of congenital HI. In addition, the EMA has granted orphan drug designation for CRN04777 for the treatment of congenital HI and the United Kingdom MHRA has granted CRN04777 an Innovation Passport for the treatment of congenital HI. We also expect CRN04777 can be broadly developed for the treatment of other diseases characterized by excess insulin secretion, including forms of syndromic hyperinsulinism.
 Hyperinsulinism background
Hyperinsulinism is a heterogeneous condition in which dangerously low blood sugar levels are caused by increased insulin secretion from pancreatic ß-cells. The most severe form of hyperinsulinism arises from congenital HI, a disorder whose underlying pathology is driven by genetic mutations in key genes involved in regulating insulin secretion from ß-cells. The
incidence of congenital HI is approximately 1 in 30,000 to 50,000 new births in the United States, and it is estimated that there are 2,200 patients in the United States, of which it is estimated that 1,500 are eligible for pharmacotherapy because surgery was not possible or curative. Hyperinsulinism is one of the most frequent causes of persistent hypoglycemia in neonates and infants. Early diagnosis is vital to prevent neurological complications due to chronic low blood sugar, which can result in neurodevelopmental and behavior disorders, epilepsy or seizures, and even death. There are also other diseases characterized by excess insulin secretion, including forms of syndromic hyperinsulinism. Rather than being caused by a single gene mutation confined to the pancreatic beta-cell, syndromic HI may occur as part of a constellation of clinical findings in diseases where genetic mutations have pleiotropic effects outside of the beta-cell. Sotos syndrome, Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome, Kabuki syndrome and Turner’s syndrome are examples of disorders from which many patients suffer from HI. It is estimated that there are approximately 1,700 patients with syndromic hyperinsulinisms in the United States. Hyperinsulinism can also be a severe complication for patients with insulin secreting tumors (insulinomas). Insulinomas are a specific type of NET derived from pancreatic ß-cells that secrete insulin and cause hypoglycemia. The incidence of insulinomas is 1 to 4 in 1,000,000 persons. Some patients who have undergone gastric bypass surgery can also present with hyperinsulinism resulting from increases in post-prandial insulin resulting in recurrent post-bariatric hypoglycemia (PBH).
 Current treatments and limitations
Maintaining glucose levels through feeding or glucose infusions is the first step in managing congenital HI. Diazoxide is the only approved therapy indicated for hyperinsulinemia. It acts at the ATP-sensitive potassium channels, or KATP, that are involved in insulin secretion and inhibits insulin secretion. However, mutations in these channels are present in approximately 55% to 60% of congenital HI patients, which limits the efficacy of the drug in this population. There are also serious side effects of diazoxide, which include hypertrichosis (abnormal and excessive hair growth over much of the body) and pulmonary hypertension, for which the FDA issued a warning regarding its use in infants and children. Somatostatin receptor 2 (SST2) agonists, octreotide and lanreotide, are also used off-label in patients who are not adequately treated with diazoxide. Octreotide is administered as subcutaneous injections up to six times/day and can suppress both insulin and glucagon secretion. As glucagon is a primary physiologic defense mechanism against hypoglycemia, targeting SST2 is not optimal for congenital HI patients, and octreotide therapy is only used effectively in 5% to 10% of the patient population, and co-administration with enteral dextrose is often required. Monthly long-acting SST2 agonists, lanreotide depot and octreotide long-acting release (LAR), have replaced short-acting octreotide in some patients. Patients receiving long-acting SST2 agonists have variable glycemic profile across the month, with hyperglycemia sometimes lasting for days after the dose, and hypoglycemia often occurring prior to the next scheduled injection. Patients who fail pharmacological therapy often progress to partial or nearly complete pancreatectomy, the surgical removal of all or a part of the pancreas, which can result in type I diabetes that must be managed for the remainder of the patient’s life. We believe an orally available SST5 agonist would provide an important new therapeutic option that inhibits insulin secretion while avoiding glucagon suppression, allowing these patients to maintain normal glucose levels and possibly avoid pancreatectomy.
 Preclinical development
In the process of discovering paltusotine, we synthesized many other drug-like nonpeptides, some of which also showed activity at other somatostatin receptor subtypes, including SST5. Because activation of SST5 is known to strongly inhibit insulin secretion, we focused on optimizing selective SST5 agonists to identify potential product candidates.
CRN04777 was examined in a rat model of congenital HI. In this model, rats were treated with sulfonylurea glyburide, which promotes insulin release by acting at KATP channels. This activity mimics the KATP channel mutations found in about half of congenital HI patients. This high level of insulin produced a decrease of blood glucose in rats. When these rats were then treated with our development candidates, blood glucose levels returned to normal, and at higher doses, even to a hyperglycemic state. Repeat dose experiments demonstrated that insulin continued to be suppressed after seven days. Further, glucagon secretion was not suppressed in these experiments.
CRN04777 met our rigorous internal criteria that we use to determine if a product candidate should enter into preclinical development. This includes extensive evaluation of pharmacology, selectivity, drug interaction potential, oral bioavailability and PK, synthetic accessibility and preliminary non-GLP safety assessments including toxicology and cardiovascular safety studies in multiple species. Additionally, preclinical safety of CRN04777 has been evaluated in in vitro and in vivo GLP studies in rats and dogs, including safety pharmacology, general toxicity, genotoxicity, and phototoxicity studies.
 Clinical development
We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 1 study of CRN04777 in healthy volunteers to assess the safety and tolerability of single and multiple doses of CRN04777. In addition, the study was designed to evaluate the potential mechanism of action of CRN04777 by measuring the suppression of insulin secretion in healthy volunteers following stimulation with either glucose or a sulfonylurea, agents that increase the secretion of insulin. We announced positive topline data from the single ascending dose cohorts in September 2021 and positive topline data from the multiple
ascending dose cohorts in March 2022. We believe CRN04777 demonstrated pharmacologic proof-of-concept in this study, based on potent suppression of stimulated insulin observed in these subjects. The plasma exposure of CRN04777 suggested the drug was well absorbed with a half-life of approximately 40 hours, which we believe supports the potential for once daily administration in patients. All adverse events were considered mild or moderate and there were no serious adverse events. CRN04777 was well tolerated at single and multiple doses from 0.5 mg up to 120 mg and exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics for the same dose range. A dose-dependent reduction in glucose-induced insulin secretion was demonstrated with an intravenous glucose tolerance test in the SAD cohorts and a dose-dependent reversal of sulfonylurea-induced insulin secretion was seen in both the SAD and MAD cohorts. The sulfonylurea-induced insulin secretion model represents a pharmacologic analog of the hyperinsulinism that the patients experience.
These data from the MAD cohorts are from 27 healthy volunteers that received daily oral doses of CRN04777 (30 mg, 60 mg or 120 mg) or placebo for 10 days with daily sampling to measure levels of fasting plasma glucose and insulin. Results showed CRN04777 treatment led to rapid, sustained and dose-dependent decreases in fasting insulin, which in turn led to dose-dependent increases in fasting plasma glucose. Pharmacokinetic and exposure profiles were consistent with expectations from the SAD cohorts. Increasing CRN04777 exposures were observed with increasing doses and the study drug was well-tolerated.
On Day 10 of each of the MAD cohorts, participants underwent a challenge with a sulfonylurea, which induces HI, pharmacologically mimicking the effects of the most common genetic mutations in congenital HI. To avoid the occurrence of hypoglycemia as a result of increased insulin secretion, patients undergoing the sulfonylurea challenge were evaluated using the euglycemic clamp procedure, meaning they received intravenous (IV) glucose support, with the glucose infusion rate increasing in automated fashion to maintain safe glucose levels. One hour after the sulfonylurea challenge, the final dose of CRN04777 was administered, which led to a dose-proportional and rapid reduction of insulin secretion and glucose infusion rate requirement compared to placebo. In participants receiving 120 mg of CRN04777, the need for IV glucose support was eliminated for most patients.
 Parathyroid Hormone Antagonist
 We are developing antagonists of the parathyroid hormone, or PTH, receptor for the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism, or PHPT and humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy, or HHM, and other diseases of excess PTH. PTH regulates calcium and phosphate homeostasis in bone and kidney through activation of its receptor, PTHR1. Increased activation of PTHR1, either via PTH or PTH-related peptide (PTHrP, PTHLH) can lead to skeletal, renal, gastrointestinal, and neurological problems. Primary hyperparathyroidism arises from a small, benign tumor on one or more of the parathyroid glands, which results in over-secretion of PTH, leading to increased blood calcium levels, or hypercalcemia. Some patients experience no symptoms, and many can have surgery to remove the tumor and/or hyperactive gland(s), while some require management with medical therapy. Symptomatic PHPT is characterized by skeletal, renal, gastrointestinal, and neurological manifestations with increased mortality. HHM typically arises in patients with advanced-stage cancers. In cases of HHM, over-secretion of PTHrP caused by the malignant tumor results in bone resorption and calcium reabsorption in the kidney, leading to hypercalcemia. We have identified investigational, orally available nonpeptide PTH antagonists that showed activity and drug-like properties in preclinical models. We are evaluating a subset of molecules to identify potential development candidates that we believe are suitable for evaluation in human clinical trials, and we expect to select a development candidate in 2023.
Research Discovery
 Patients with many other debilitating endocrine diseases await new therapeutic options, and we are continuously evaluating where to next deploy our drug discovery efforts. We plan to continue to expand our drug discovery efforts and leverage our expertise in the evaluation of additional conditions including polycystic kidney disease, metabolic diseases (including diabetes and obesity) and Graves’ Disease (including Thyroid Eye Disease), among other indications. All of our product candidates have been discovered, characterized and developed internally and are the subject of composition of matter patent applications. We have retained worldwide rights to commercialize our product candidates and do not have any royalty obligations except with respect to the exclusive right to develop and commercialize paltusotine in Japan pursuant to the Sanwa License, and the exclusive right to our radiotherapeutics technology pursuant to the Radionetics License.
Competition
The commercialization of new drugs is competitive, and we could face competition from a number of pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies around the world. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects or more convenient than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we do. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our programs are likely to be their efficacy, safety and convenience.

With respect to paltusotine, injected peptide somatostatin agonists and GH receptor antagonists are the main medical therapies for acromegaly patients where surgery is unsuccessful. There are three injected somatostatin analogs approved for the treatment of acromegaly: octreotide (marketed by Novartis AG), lanreotide (marketed by Ipsen Biopharmaceuticals, Inc.) and pasireotide (marketed by Recordati Rare Diseases Inc.). Pegvisomant (marketed by Pfizer Inc.) is a daily injectable growth hormone receptor antagonist and is generally used in patients not fully controlled on somatostatin analogs. Orally administered dopamine agonists, such as bromocriptine and cabergoline, are also used. In 2020, Chiasma, Inc. (Chiasma acquired by Amryt Pharma, Aug 2021) received marketing approval in the United States for an oral octreotide product, MYCAPSSA, for long-term maintenance treatment in acromegaly patients who have responded to and tolerated treatment with octreotide or lanreotide. In December 2021, the FDA approved a lanreotide injection biosimilar manufactured by Cipla Ltd. for the treatment of acromegaly and GEP-NETs. Other products in clinical development include new formulations of peptide somatostatin agonists or GH receptor antagonists. Other companies developing new pharmaceutical therapies for acromegaly include Camurus AB, Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc./Antisense Therapeutics Ltd., Aquestive Therapeutics, Inc., XERIS Pharmaceuticals, Amolyt Pharma and Rani Therapeutics, Inc.
 Injected depots of peptide somatostatin analogs are used as therapy for NETs. In adults whose carcinoid syndrome symptoms are inadequately controlled by somatostatin therapy, telotristat ethyl (marketed by TerSera Therapeutics, Inc.) is an orally administered add-on therapy. In 2018, the FDA approved Novartis’ Lutathera for the treatment of somatostatin receptor positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Camurus, Amryt, POINT Biopharma Global Inc., and ITM Isotopen Technologien Munchen are currently engaged in Phase 3 trials of new compounds for use in the treatment of NETs and/or carcinoid syndrome symptoms. Other companies developing NETs therapeutics that target somatostatin receptors include, Ipsen, Oranomed/RadioMedix, Xencor, Tarveda Therapeutics, Advanced Accelerator Applications SA, ASCIL Biopharm, DexTech Medical, Aquestive Therapeutics Inc., Molecular Targeting Technologies Inc., Viewpoint Molecular Targeting LLC, Xeris Pharmaceuticals, and Immunwork Inc.
 With respect to congenital HI, maintaining glucose levels through feeding or glucose infusions is the first step in managing the disease. Diazoxide (marketed by Teva Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) is the only approved therapy indicated for hyperinsulinemia. Octreotide (used off-label) is administered as subcutaneous injections in those who respond poorly to diazoxide. Patients who fail pharmacological therapy often progress to partial or nearly complete pancreatectomy, which can result in type I diabetes that must be managed for the remainder of the patient’s life. Ready-to-use glucagon analog products have also been approved and could be used to treat congenital HI if a patient experiences severe hypoglycemia and includes Zegalogue, which received approval in 2021 and is marketed by Zealand Pharma A/S, and Gvoke HypoPen, which received approval in 2019 and is marketed by Xeris Pharmaceuticals, Inc,. Companies developing products for potential use in congenital HI include Rezolute, Inc., Hanmi Pharmaceuticals, Eiger Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., Sosei Heptares and AmideBio.
As with acromegaly, first-line therapy for Cushing’s disease is surgery to remove the pituitary tumor if possible. Use of adrenal enzyme inhibitors (metyrapone, ketoconazole and more recently levoketoconazole which gained FDA approval in December 2021 and is marketed by Xeris Pharmaceuticals) prevent the synthesis of cortisol and can improve symptoms. Mifepristone (marketed by Corcept Therapeutics, Inc.), a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, is approved for control of hyperglycemia in Cushing’s syndrome. Osilodrostat (marketed by Recordati), a cortisol synthesis inhibitor, is approved for the treatment of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome. The somatostatin agonist pasireotide is also approved for Cushing’s disease. Other companies developing products for potential use in Cushing’s disease include Corcept Therapeutics, Inc., and Cyclacel Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Neurocrine Biosciences and Spruce Biosciences are developing CRF receptor antagonists for the treatment of CAH. BridgeBio Pharma is also developing a potentially curative gene therapy treatment for CAH targeting the 21-hydroxylase enzyme. 
There may be other earlier stage clinical programs that, if approved, would compete with our products. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we have. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. Competition may increase further as a result of advances made in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these fields. Our success will be based in part on our ability to build and actively manage a portfolio of drugs that addresses unmet medical needs and creates value in patient therapy.
Intellectual property
We actively protect our commercially important proprietary technology by, among other methods, obtaining, maintaining, and defending our patent rights. Issued patents can provide protection for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In general, patents issued for applications filed in the United States can provide exclusionary rights for 20 years
from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, the term of an issued U.S. patent that covers or claims an FDA approved product can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period, which is called patent term extension. The period of patent term extension in the United States cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the extension period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The term of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with the laws of the foreign jurisdiction, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. Some countries also provide mechanisms to recapture a portion of the patent term lost during regulatory review, similar to patent term extension in the United States. The amount of patent term that can be recaptured depends on the laws of the relevant jurisdictions. There is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the USPTO in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 We have filed numerous patent applications covering our internally developed product candidates in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States, resulting in multiple issued patents. We currently file patent applications covering the compounds in our lead product candidates in the United States, Europe, Japan, China, South Korea, Australia, Canada, Israel, Mexico, Taiwan, Brazil, India, Eurasia, New Zealand, Ukraine, Indonesia, Singapore, and South Africa, and certain candidates in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Chile, Colombia, Argentina, Peru, Venezuela, and Egypt. We pursue patent protection for all inventions and improvements throughout development, including, when possible, compositions of matter, methods of use, dosage regimens, formulations, crystalline forms (polymorphs), and manufacturing processes.
  We own multiple issued patents and pending patent applications relating to our lead product candidate paltusotine. Issued patents claiming the compound paltusotine as composition-of-matter have been obtained in the United States, Europe, China, and Japan, among other jurisdictions, and are estimated to expire in 2037, not including any available patent term adjustments or extensions. We own additional issued patents and pending patent applications relating to our lead product candidate paltusotine, its methods of use, dosage regimens, formulations, and crystalline forms (polymorphs), which, when issued, are estimated to expire between 2039 and 2043, not including any available patent term adjustments or extensions.
 We own multiple issued patents and pending patent applications relating to our ACTH antagonist product candidate CRN04894. Issued patents claiming the compound CRN04894 as composition-of-matter have been obtained in the United States and are estimated to expire in 2039, not including any available patent term adjustments or extensions. We own additional pending patent applications relating to our lead product candidate CRN04894, its methods of use, and crystalline forms (polymorphs), which, when issued, are estimated to expire between 2042 and 2043, not including any available patent term adjustments or extensions.
 We own an issued patent and multiple pending patent applications relating to our SST5 product candidate CRN04777. An issued patent claiming the compound CRN04777 as composition-of-matter has been obtained in the United States and is estimated to expire in 2040, not including any available patent term adjustments or extensions. We own additional patent applications relating to our lead product candidate CRN04777, its methods of use, and crystalline forms (polymorphs), which, when issued, are estimated to expire in 2042, not including any available patent term adjustments or extensions.
  We own a variety of other issued patents and pending patent applications related to various compounds, pharmaceutical compositions and methods of use. The issued patents, and any patents that may issue from the pending patent applications, are estimated to expire between 2036 and 2043, not including any available patent term adjustments or extensions.
We also possess substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to the development and commercialization of our product candidates, including related manufacturing processes and technology, which strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of endocrinology. We own one registered trademark in the United States, three registered trademarks in the UK, and three registered trademarks in the European Union. We also plan to rely on data exclusivities and market exclusivities, when available, to provide additional protection for our products.
 Certain intellectual property rights, including for our lead programs, have been generated through the use of U.S. government funding provided from our Small Business Innovation Research Grants, or SBIR Grants, awarded to us by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National Institutes of Health, and are therefore subject to certain federal regulations. As a result, the U.S. government may have certain rights to intellectual property embodied in our current or future product candidates pursuant to the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980.
Manufacturing
Manufacturing, testing and storage of our product candidates for nonclinical and clinical studies is conducted at third-party contract manufacturers and distributors. We do not plan to build plants or facilities for development or commercial scale manufacture or storage of our product candidates. To date, the contract manufacturers have met our manufacturing requirements, and we expect them to be capable of providing sufficient quantities of our product candidates to meet estimated full-scale commercial needs. However, the contract manufacturers may be required to increase production scale, or we may need to secure alternate suppliers.
Commercialization
 We intend to build the infrastructure to effectively support the commercialization of our product candidates, if and when we believe a regulatory approval of the first of such product candidates in a particular geographic market appears imminent. The infrastructure for orphan products typically consists of medical liaisons and a targeted, specialty sales force that calls on a focused group of physicians supported by sales management, internal sales support, an internal marketing group and distribution support. One challenge unique to commercializing therapies for rare diseases is the difficulty in identifying eligible patients due to the very small and sometimes heterogeneous disease populations.
Additional capabilities important to the orphan marketplace include the management of key accounts, such as managed care organizations, group purchasing organizations, specialty pharmacies and government accounts. To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure, we will have to invest significant amounts of financial and management resources, some of which will be committed prior to any confirmation that any of our product candidates will be approved.
Where appropriate, we may elect in the future to utilize strategic partners, distributors or contract sales forces to assist in the commercialization of our product candidates. In certain instances, we may consider building our own commercial infrastructure.
Government regulation
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. A new drug must be approved by the FDA through the New Drug Application, or NDA, process before it may be legally marketed in the United States.
U.S. drug development process
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with GLP regulations and other applicable regulations; 
 •submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
 •approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated; 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use; 
 •submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal trials; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements to assure that the facilities, 

methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCP; and
•FDA review and approval of the NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
 Once a product candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. An IND will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, if the trial includes an efficacy evaluation. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns about on-going or proposed clinical trials or non-compliance with specific FDA requirements, and the trials may not begin or continue until the FDA notifies the sponsor that the hold has been lifted.
All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and a separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. While the IND is active, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
 Furthermore, an independent IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve each protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution and must also approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each trial subject or his or her legal representative, monitor the study until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. In addition, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. Depending on its charter, this group may determine whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries, including clinicaltrials.gov.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
 •Phase 2: The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. 
 •Phase 3: The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 

Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meetings at the end of the Phase 2 trial to discuss Phase 2 clinical results and present plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
U.S. review and approval process
The results of product development, preclinical and other non-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once filed, the FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision after it the application is submitted.
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.
 After the FDA evaluates an NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter, or CRL. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A CRL usually describes the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA and may require additional clinical data, such as an additional clinical trial or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a CRL is issued, the sponsor must resubmit the NDA or, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. In addition, the FDA may require a sponsor to conduct Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval, and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approval including the requirement for a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved
REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products.
In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs and supplements must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation.
Orphan drug designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or, if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease or condition for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or inability to manufacture the product in sufficient quantities. The designation of such drug also entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. However, competitors, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity also could block the approval of a competing product for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug as defined by the FDA or if a product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same disease or condition. In addition, if an orphan designated product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan exclusivity.
Expedited development and review programs
The FDA has a fast track designation program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drug products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. The sponsor of a fast track product candidate has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the applicable FDA review team during product development and, once an NDA is submitted, the product candidate may be eligible for priority review. With regard to a fast track product candidate, the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
A product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product candidate can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of senior managers.
 Any product candidate submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product candidate with a fast track designation or breakthrough designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. An NDA is eligible for priority review if the product candidate is
designed to treat a serious condition, and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or efficacy compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. The FDA endeavors to review applications with priority review designations within six months of the filing date as compared to ten months for review of new molecular entity NDAs under its current PDUFA review goals.
In addition, a product candidate may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug products intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA generally requires that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled confirmatory clinical trials. Drugs receiving accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required confirmatory trials in a timely manner or if such trials fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
Fast track designation, priority review and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
 Post-approval requirements
Any products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, certain manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP regulations and other laws and regulations. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 •restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
 •fines, warning letters, or untitled letters;
 •clinical holds on clinical studies;
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
 •consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
 •mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
 •the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
 In addition, the FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drug products. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse
publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
Marketing exclusivity
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2), or 505(b)(2) NDA, submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all of the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder.
The FDCA alternatively provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of marketing exclusivity available in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity attached to another period of exclusivity if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA. The issuance of a written request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials.
 U.S. coverage and reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any therapeutic product candidate for which we may seek regulatory approval. Sales in the United States will depend in part on the availability of sufficient coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, which include government health programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and the Veterans Administration, as well as managed care organizations and private health insurers. Prices at which we or our customers seek reimbursement for our therapeutic product candidates can be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by payors.
The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be available. Additionally, in the United States there is no uniform policy among payors for coverage or reimbursement. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies, but also have their own methods and approval processes. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. If coverage and adequate reimbursement are not available, or are available only at limited levels, successful commercialization of, and obtaining a satisfactory financial return on, any product we develop may not be possible.
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for marketing, we may need to conduct expensive studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of any products, which would be in addition to the costs expended to obtain regulatory approvals. Third-party payors may not consider our product candidates to be medically necessary or cost-effective compared to other available therapies, or the rebate percentages required to secure favorable coverage may not yield an adequate margin over cost or may not enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development.
Healthcare reform
In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of drug product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect the profitable sale of drug product candidates.
Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access.
 In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as subsequently amended by as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively the ACA, was passed, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, as amended, among other things: (1) increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; (2) established an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs; (3) expanded the availability of lower pricing under the 340B drug pricing program by adding new entities to the program; (4) increased the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; (5) expanded the eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; (6) created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; (7) created a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; (8) established a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and (9) established a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drugs.
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial, Congressional and executive challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers, which was temporarily suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022. In addition, on March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 was signed into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, or AMP, beginning January 1, 2024. Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, was signed into law. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare (beginning in 2026), with prices that can be negotiated subject to a cap; imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023); and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025). The IRA permits the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. For that and other reasons, it is currently unclear how the IRA will be effectuated. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
U.S. healthcare fraud and abuse laws and compliance requirements
Federal and state healthcare laws and regulations restrict business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. These laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws and regulations, and transparency laws and regulations with respect to drug pricing and payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and other licensed healthcare professionals.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any individual or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act.
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal civil and criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to CMS information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain non-physician practitioners including physician assistants and nurse practitioners, and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
Similar state and foreign laws and regulations may also restrict business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non- governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or by patients themselves; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws and regulations that require drug manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information, which requires tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to physicians, other healthcare providers and entities; state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives.
Efforts to ensure compliance with applicable healthcare laws and regulations can involve substantial costs. Violations of healthcare laws can result in significant penalties, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other U.S. healthcare programs, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment or restructuring of operations.
 Data Privacy and Security
Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, including consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of personal information, including health-related information. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy laws, and consumer protection laws and regulations (e.g., Section 5 of the FTC Act), that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. In addition, certain foreign laws govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health-related data. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
 Cybersecurity
In the normal course of business, we may collect and store personal information and certain sensitive company information, including proprietary and confidential business information, trade secrets, intellectual property, information regarding trial
participants in connection with clinical trials, sensitive third-party information and employee information. To protect this information, our existing cybersecurity policies require monitoring and detection programs, network security measures, encryption of critical data, and security assessment of vendors. We maintain various protections designed to safeguard against cyberattacks, including firewalls and virus detection software. We have established and test our disaster recovery plan and we protect against business interruption by backing up our major systems. In addition, we periodically scan our environment for any vulnerabilities, perform penetration testing and engage third parties to assess effectiveness of our data security practices. A third party security consultant conducts regular network security reviews, scans and audits. In addition, we maintain insurance that includes cybersecurity coverage.
 Despite the implementation of our cybersecurity program, our security measures cannot guarantee that a significant cyberattack will not occur. A successful attack on our information technology systems could have significant consequences to the business. While we devote resources to our security measures to protect our systems and information, these measures cannot provide absolute security. See “Risk Factors – General Risk Factors” for additional information about the risks to our business associated with a breach or compromise to our information technology systems.
 Employees and Human Capital Resources
 As of February 24, 2023, we had 210 full-time employees, 55 of whom have a Ph.D. or M.D. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. In addition, we rely on a number of consultants to assist us.
 Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integration our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards and cash-based performance bonus awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
 Insurance
 We maintain limited product liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials in the amount of $10 million per occurrence and $10 million in the aggregate. However, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and we may not be able to obtain or maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability.
