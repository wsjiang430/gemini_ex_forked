Item 1.  Business 
GENERAL 
 In this Form 10-K, all references to the “Company” or “Movado Group” include Movado Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise. The Company’s common stock is traded on the NYSE under the trading symbol MOV. 
 Movado Group designs, sources, markets and distributes quality watches. Its portfolio of watch brands is currently comprised of owned brands MOVADO®, MVMT®, OLIVIA BURTON®, EBEL® and CONCORD® as well as licensed brands COACH®, TOMMY HILFIGER®, HUGO BOSS®, LACOSTE®, SCUDERIA FERRARI®, REBECCA MINKOFF® and URI MINKOFF®. The Company is a leader in the design, development, marketing and distribution of watch brands sold in almost every major category comprising the watch industry. 
 The Company was incorporated in New York in 1967 under the name North American Watch Corporation to acquire Piaget Watch Corporation and Corum Watch Corporation, which had been, respectively, the exclusive importers and distributors of Piaget and Corum watches in the United States since the 1950’s. The Company sold its Piaget and Corum distribution businesses in 1999 and 2000, respectively, to focus on its own portfolio of brands. Since its incorporation, the Company has developed its brand-building reputation and distinctive image across an expanding number of brands and geographic markets. Strategic acquisitions of watch brands and their subsequent growth, along with license agreements, have played an important role in the expansion of the Company’s brand portfolio. 
 In 1970, the Company acquired the Concord brand and the Swiss company that had been manufacturing Concord watches since 1908. In 1983, the Company acquired the U.S. distributor of Movado watches and substantially all of the assets related to the Movado brand from the Swiss manufacturer of Movado watches. The Company changed its name to Movado Group, Inc. in 1996. In March 2004, the Company completed its acquisition of Ebel, one of the world’s premier luxury watch brands which was established in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland in 1911. In July 2017, the Company completed its acquisition of Olivia Burton, which was founded in 2011 and has been one of the United Kingdom’s fastest-growing fashion watch and jewelry brands. In October 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of MVMT, which was founded in 2013, offering watches and accessories designed for the millennial consumer largely through a direct-to-consumer business model.
 The Company is highly selective in its licensing strategy and chooses to enter into long-term agreements with only powerful brands with strong positions in their respective businesses. 
 The following table sets forth the brands licensed by the Company and the year in which the Company launched each licensed brand for watches.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
 On October 12, 2018, the Company, together with Movado Group Delaware Holdings Corporation, Movado Retail Group, Inc. and Movado LLC (together with the Company, the “U.S. Borrowers”), each a wholly owned domestic subsidiary of the Company, and Movado Watch Company S.A. and MGI Luxury Group S.A. (collectively, the “Swiss Borrowers” and, together with the U.S. Borrowers, the “Borrowers”), each a wholly owned Swiss subsidiary of the Company, entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with the lenders party thereto and Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent (in such capacity, the “Agent”). The Credit Agreement amends and restates the Company’s prior credit agreement dated as of January 30, 2015 and extends the maturity of the $100.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Facility”) provided thereunder to October 12, 2023.  The Facility includes a $15.0 million letter of credit subfacility, a $25.0 million swingline subfacility and a $75.0 million sublimit for borrowings by the Swiss Borrowers, with provisions for uncommitted increases to the Facility of up to $50.0 million in the aggregate subject to customary terms and conditions. 
 On October 1, 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of MVMT Watches, Inc. the owner of MVMT, a global aspirational lifestyle brand. The purchase price was comprised of an initial payment of $100 million, or approximately $85 million net of tax benefits that are anticipated to be generated from the acquisition, and two future contingent payments that combined could total up to an additional $100 million before tax benefits. The exact amount of the future payments will be determined by MVMT’s future financial performance with no minimum required future payment. The acquisition was funded through cash on hand and borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit facility. MVMT offers watches and accessories designed for the millennial consumer with the goal of changing the way the customers thinks about fashion by delivering its products at an affordable price.  Prior to the acquisition, MVMT products were primarily sold through its global e-commerce sites and also a few select retailers in the United States, although the wholesale business has been expanded since the acquisition. MVMT’s world-class digital strategy has driven high brand awareness across social media with an active community of over 5 million followers.

BRANDS 
 The Company designs, develops, sources, markets and distributes products under the following watch brands: 
 Owned Brands
 Concord 
 Concord was founded through the collaboration of five Swiss visionaries in 1908. The brand has since gone on to build a lasting legacy of harmonious collaboration. Concord was acquired by entrepreneur Gedalio Grinberg in 1970. In 1979, Concord spearheaded the Swiss quartz revolution with one of the most important watches of the twentieth century: the Concord Delirium. This was the first watch ever produced to be less than one millimeter thick – a world record to this day. To mark its 110th anniversary, Concord introduced a new logo: the knot. The knot represents a harmonious unity, elemental to the foundation of Concord.
Ebel 
 Ebel’s success has been built upon the fusion of technical excellence and a passion for aesthetically daring and timeless, distinctive design. A passion for innovation and excellence in watch design has always been at the heart of the Ebel brand. Ebel was founded by husband and wife Eugène Blum and Alice Lévy, in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland in 1911. Since its inception, Ebel has remained true to its core values, manufacturing fine Swiss watches that marry beauty and function. Renowned today for its iconic bracelet design with signature wave-shaped links, Ebel continues to create timepieces that embody luxury and contemporary elegance with subtle, yet exquisite detail.
Movado 
 The Movado brand is renowned for its iconic Museum® dial and modern design aesthetic. Since its founding in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland in 1881, Movado has earned more than 100 patents and 200 international awards for artistry and innovation in watch design and technology, and Movado timepieces have won world renown for their unique beauty and timeless design.
 Movado is a hallmark of some of the most famous timepieces ever created, most notably, the Movado Museum® Watch. Designed in 1947 by Bauhaus-influenced artist Nathan George Horwitt, the watch dial defined by a solitary dot at 12 o’clock, symbolizing the sun at high noon, has been acclaimed for purity of design unrivaled in the history of time-keeping. When Horwitt’s dial was selected for the permanent design collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1960, it became the first watch dial ever awarded this distinction. Known today as the Movado Museum Watch, this legendary dial is regarded as an icon of Modernism. A trademarked and award-winning design, the celebrated single dot dial now distinguishes a wide range of Movado timepieces.

Along with its long, rich heritage of design innovation, the Movado brand experience is also defined by a close, enduring association with the arts. Expressions of Movado’s commitment to the fine and cultural arts encompass commissioned watch designs by famed artists, affiliations with talented brand ambassadors, sponsorship of major arts institutions and support of emerging artists.
 The Movado BOLD collection represents iconic Movado design re-imagined for the fashion-savvy, on-trend consumer. It is innovative in both design and use of materials. The Movado Heritage collection, launched in the spring of 2016, is inspired by Movado’s rich pre-Museum dial history.  Heritage uses the past to create new designs that are modern and relevant.
 In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company launched the use of smartwatch technology in its Movado brand watches.
 Olivia Burton
 Olivia Burton is a brand founded by two best friends, who started out with nothing but each other and a shared dream to start their own brand of beautiful watches. As fashion buyers, they recognized a gap in the market for pretty, fresh and feminine styles that they truly wanted to wear. Olivia Burton launched in Harvey Nichols in the UK as their first stockist and the brand was well received from the get-go, with some styles selling out straight away. Inspired by vintage, fashion trends and nature, Olivia Burton releases new collections every two months so that customers can always count on something fresh, new and exciting that they won’t find anywhere else. This has helped to establish the brand as one of the most exciting and directional women’s fashion watch brands in the global market. As well as innovative timepieces, including vegan and eco-friendly collections, Olivia Burton creates beautifully-made jewelry and accessories with quality materials to ensure they stand the test of time. 
MVMT   
 
The MVMT brand was founded in 2013 by two young entrepreneurs.  Originally empowered by crowdfunding and built digitally with a community of social media followers, their philosophy was to create a brand offering beautiful quality products that are accessible to young consumers. MVMT’s designs and messaging embody the spirit of adventuring, creating, and daring to disrupt the norm. This spirit is embodied in the brand’s motto: “Live life on your own terms.” The brand includes watches, jewelry, other accessories, sunglasses and glasses made for viewing digital screens.

Minkoff launched watches in 2017 with styles that are nuanced and complex. Similarly, accessories label Uri Minkoff offers distinctly understated menswear timepieces.
DESIGN AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT 
 The Company’s offerings undergo two phases before they are produced for sale to customers: design and product development. The design phase includes the creation of artistic and conceptual renderings while product development involves the construction of prototypes. Certain Movado collections, including Movado BOLD, and the Company’s licensed brands are designed by in-house design teams in Switzerland and the United States in cooperation with outside sources, including (in the case of the licensed brands) licensors’ design teams. Product development for the licensed brands and certain Movado collections, including Movado BOLD, takes place in the Company’s Asia operations. For the Company’s Movado (with the exception of certain Movado collections, including Movado BOLD), Ebel and Concord brands, the design phase is performed by a combination of in-house and freelance designers in Europe and the United States while product development is carried out in the Company’s Swiss operations. For the Company’s Olivia Burton and MVMT brands, the design phase and product development are performed by in-house design teams in London and Los Angeles, respectively. 
MARKETING 
 The Company’s marketing strategy is to communicate a consistent, brand-specific message to the consumer. As the consumer footprint continues to evolve, the Company is increasingly focused on its digital marketing and online reach, including expanding and improving its social media channels and its messaging through individuals with significant social media followings (i.e., “influencers”). On March 7, 2018, the Company announced that it is establishing a Digital Center of Excellence to help elevate its customers’ digital experience globally through innovative technologies and consumer-facing initiatives. Recognizing that advertising is an integral component to the successful marketing of its product offerings, the Company devotes significant resources to advertising and maintains its own in-house advertising department which focuses primarily on the implementation and management of global marketing and advertising strategies for each of the Company’s brands, ensuring consistency of presentation. The Company develops advertising campaigns individually for each of the Company’s brands, utilizing outside agencies as deemed appropriate. These campaigns are directed primarily to the end consumer rather than to trade customers. The Company’s advertising targets consumers with particular demographic characteristics appropriate to the image and price range of each brand. Company advertising is placed in magazines and other print media, on radio and television, online, including websites and social media platforms, in catalogs, on outdoor signs and through other promotional materials. Marketing expenses totaled 15.9%, 12.9%, and 13.7% of net sales in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
OPERATING SEGMENTS 
 The Company conducts its business primarily in two operating segments: Watch and Accessory Brands (formerly named Wholesale) and Company Stores (formerly named Retail). There is no change to how the company conducts its business within these two operating segments. For operating segment data and geographic segment data for the years ended January 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements regarding Segment and Geographic Information.
 The Company’s Watch and Accessory Brands segment includes the designing, manufacturing and distribution of watches of quality owned brands and licensed brands, in addition to revenue generated from after-sales service activities and shipping. The Company Stores segment includes the Company’s retail outlet locations in the United States and Canada.
 6


The Company divides its business into two major geographic locations: United States operations, and International, which includes the results of all non-U.S. Company operations Substantially all of the Company’s tangible International assets are owned by the Company’s Swiss and Hong Kong subsidiaries. For a discussion of the risks associated with the Company’s operations conducted outside the United States, see “A significant portion of the Company’s business is conducted outside of the United States. Many factors affecting business activities outside the United States could adversely impact this business”. under Item 1A. Risk Factors, below.
 Watch and Accessory Brands 
 Watch and Accessory Brands Business in the United States
 The Company sells all of its brands in the U.S. Watch and Accessory Brands market primarily to department stores, such as Macy’s and Nordstrom; major jewelry store chains, such as Signet Jewelers, Ltd. and Helzberg Diamonds Corp.; independent jewelers; and online retailers, such as Amazon; as well as directly to consumers through the Company’s e-commerce platforms, such as www.movado.com and www.mvmtwatches.com . Sales to trade customers in the United States are made directly by the Company’s U.S. sales force and, to a lesser extent, independent sales representatives. Sales representatives are responsible for a defined geographic territory, generally specialize in a particular brand and sell to and service independent jewelers within their territory. The sales force also consists of account executives and account representatives who, respectively, sell to and service chain and department store accounts. 
Watch and Accessory Brands Business in International Markets
 Internationally, the Company’s brands are sold to department stores, jewelry chains, independent jewelers and online retailers, as well as directly to consumers through the Company’s e-commerce platforms, such as www.oliviaburton.com and www.mvmtwatches.com. The Company employs its own international sales force operating at the Company’s sales and distribution offices in Canada, China, Germany, France, Hong Kong, Singapore, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates. In addition, the Company sells all of its brands through a network of independent distributors operating in numerous countries around the world. A majority of the Company’s arrangements with its international distributors are long-term, generally require certain minimum purchases and minimum advertising expenditures and impose restrictions on the distributor’s sale of competitive products. 
Company Stores
 The Company’s subsidiary, Movado Retail Group, Inc., operates 43 retail outlet locations in outlet centers across the United States and one newly opened location in Ontario, Canada, which serve as an effective vehicle to sell current and discontinued models and factory seconds of all of the Company’s watches. 
SEASONALITY 
 The Company’s sales are traditionally greater during the Christmas and holiday season. Consequently, the Company’s net sales historically have been higher during the second half of its fiscal year. The amount of net sales and operating profit generated during the second half of each fiscal year depends upon the general level of retail sales during the Christmas and holiday season, as well as economic conditions and other factors beyond the Company’s control. Major selling seasons in certain international markets center on significant local holidays that occur in late winter or early spring. The second half of each fiscal year accounted for 60.1% (which includes the acquisition of MVMT on October 1, 2018), 59.8% (which included the acquisition of the Olivia Burton brand on July 3, 2017) and 56.2% of the Company’s net sales for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. 
BACKLOG 
 At March 22, 2019, the Company had unfilled orders of $47.2 million compared to $42.9 million at March 22, 2018 and $45.0 million at March 24, 2017. Unfilled orders include both confirmed orders and orders that the Company believes will be confirmed based on the historical experience with the customers. It is customary for many of the Company’s customers not to confirm their future orders with formal purchase orders until shortly before their desired delivery dates.

CUSTOMER SERVICE, WARRANTY AND REPAIR 
 The Company assists in the retail sales process of its wholesale customers by monitoring their sales and inventories by product category and style. The Company also assists in the conception, development and implementation of customers’ marketing vehicles. The Company places considerable emphasis on cooperative advertising programs with its wholesale customers. The Company’s assistance in the retail sales process has resulted in close relationships with its principal customers, often allowing for influence on the mix, quantity and timing of their purchasing decisions. The Company believes that customers’ familiarity with its sales approach has facilitated, and should continue to facilitate, the introduction of new products through its distribution network. 
 The Company permits the return of damaged or defective products. In addition, although the Company generally has no obligation to do so, it accepts other returns from customers in certain instances. 
 The Company has service facilities around the world, including four Company-owned service facilities and multiple independent service centers which are authorized to perform warranty repairs. A list of authorized service centers can be accessed online at www.mgiservice.com.

The Company obtains other watch components for all of its brands, including movements, cases, hands, dials, bracelets and straps from a number of other suppliers. The Company generally does not have long-term supply commitments with any of its component parts suppliers.

In October 2018, the Company notified Tommy Hilfiger Licensing LLC of its intent to so extend the agreement.
 On November 3, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with HUGO BOSS Trade Mark Management GmbH & Co. that extended the term and made certain other changes to the license agreement originally entered into by the parties on December 15, 2004 (the “Hugo Boss License Agreement”), under which the Company received a worldwide exclusive license to use the trademark HUGO BOSS® and any other trademarks containing the names “HUGO” or “BOSS”, in connection with the production, promotion and sale of watches.

This collection launched in calendar year 2017. The current term of the Rebecca Minkoff license and collaboration agreement is through October 21, 2026.    
 Prior to December 31, 2017, the Company and ABG Juicy Couture, LLC (as assignee of L.C. Licensing, Inc.) were parties to a license agreement pursuant to which the Company licensed the exclusive worldwide right to use the trademark JUICY COUTURE® and related trademarks in connection with the manufacture, advertising, merchandising, promotion, sale and distribution of timepieces.

 The Company actively seeks to protect and enforce its intellectual property rights by working with industry associations, anti-counterfeiting organizations, private investigators and law enforcement authorities, including customs authorities in the United States and internationally, and, when necessary, suing infringers of its trademarks and patents. Consequently, the Company is involved from time to time in litigation or other proceedings to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of these rights. The Company has registered the trademarks CONCORD®, EBEL®, MOVADO®, MVMT®, OLIVIA BURTON® and certain other related trademarks with customs authorities in the United States and certain other countries in order to assist such authorities in their efforts to prevent the importation of counterfeit goods or goods bearing confusingly similar trademarks. Customs regulations do not, however, cover the unauthorized importation of genuine products. 
 COMPETITION 
 The markets for each of the Company’s watch brands are highly competitive. With the exception of Swatch Group, Ltd., a large Swiss-based competitor, no single company competes with the Company across all of its brands. Multiple companies, however, compete with Movado Group with respect to one or more of its watch brands. Certain of these companies have, and other companies that may enter the Company’s markets in the future may have, greater financial, distribution, marketing and advertising resources than the Company. The Company’s future success will depend, to a significant degree, upon its continued ability to compete effectively with regard to, among other things, the style, quality, price, advertising, marketing, distribution and availability of supply of the Company’s watches and other products.
