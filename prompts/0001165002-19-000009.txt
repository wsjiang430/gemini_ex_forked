Item 1. | Business.

Unless the context otherwise requires, the term “we,” “us,” “our,” “Westwood,” or “Westwood Holdings Group” when used in this Form 10-K (“Report”) and in the Annual Report to the Stockholders refers to Westwood Holdings Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole. This Report contains some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Actual results and the timing of some events could differ materially from those projected in or contemplated by the forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including without limitation those set forth under “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
General
We manage investment assets and provide services for our clients through our subsidiaries, Westwood Management Corp. and Westwood Advisors, L.L.C. (each of which is an SEC-registered investment adviser and referred to hereinafter together as “Westwood Management”), Westwood International Advisors Inc. (“Westwood International Advisors”) and Westwood Trust. Westwood Management, founded in 1983, provides investment advisory services to institutional investors, a family of mutual funds called the Westwood Funds®, other mutual funds, an Irish investment company authorized pursuant to the European Communities (Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities) Regulation 2011 (as amended) (the “UCITS Fund”), individual investors and clients of Westwood Trust. Westwood International Advisors was established in 2012 and provides investment advisory services to institutional clients, the Westwood Funds®, other mutual funds, the UCITS Fund and clients of Westwood Trust. Westwood Trust, founded as a state-chartered trust company in 1974, provides trust and custodial services and participation in self-sponsored common trust funds to institutions and high net worth individuals. Our revenues are generally derived from fees based on a percentage of assets under management. Westwood Management, Westwood International Advisors and Westwood Trust collectively managed assets valued at approximately $16.6 billion at December 31, 2018. We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on December 12, 2001. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “WHG.” We are a holding company whose principal assets consist of the capital stock of Westwood Management, Westwood Trust and Westwood International Advisors.
The success of our business is dependent on client, institutional investment consultant and intermediary relationships. We believe that, in addition to investment performance, client service is paramount in the asset management business. Accordingly, a major business focus is to build strong relationships with clients to enhance our ability to anticipate their needs and satisfy their investment objectives. Our team approach is designed to deliver efficient, responsive service to our clients.
We have focused on building our foundation in terms of personnel and infrastructure to support a larger business. We have developed investment strategies that we expect to be desirable within our target institutional, wealth management and mutual fund markets. Developing new investment strategies and building the organization can result in incurring expenses before significant offsetting revenues are realized. We continue to evaluate new strategies and resources in terms of meeting actual and potential investor needs.

Advisory
General
Our advisory business is comprised of Westwood Management and Westwood International Advisors and encompasses three distinct investment teams – the U.S. Value Team, the Global Convertible Securities Team and the Emerging Markets Equity Team.
Westwood Management provides investment advisory services to large institutions, including corporate retirement plans, public retirement plans, endowments and foundations. Institutional separate account minimums vary by investment strategy and generally range from $5 million to $25 million. Westwood Management also provides advisory services to individuals, the Westwood Funds® and the UCITS Fund, as well as subadvisory services to other mutual funds and pooled investment vehicles. Westwood Management’s investment strategies are managed by the U.S. Value Team, based in Dallas, Texas, and by the Global Convertible Securities Team, based in Boston, Massachusetts. Our U.S. investment professionals average fifteen years of investment experience. We believe team continuity and years of experience are among the critical elements required for successfully managing investments.
Westwood International Advisors, based in Toronto, Canada, provides investment advisory services to large institutions, pooled investment vehicles and the UCITS Fund, as well as subadvisory services to the National Bank Westwood Funds, which are mutual funds offered by National Bank of Canada. Institutional separate account minimums vary by investment strategy and generally range from $10 million to $25 million. Westwood International Advisors' investment strategies are managed by the Emerging Markets Equity Team, with an average of 23 years of investment experience. Westwood International Advisors has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with Westwood Management pursuant to which Westwood International Advisors is considered a “participating affiliate” of Westwood Management as that term is used in relief granted by the staff of the SEC allowing U.S. registered investment advisers to use portfolio management or research resources of advisory affiliates subject to the supervision of a registered adviser. Pursuant to the MOU, Westwood International Advisors professionals provide advisory and subadvisory services to certain Westwood Funds®, pooled investment vehicles and large institutions under the supervision of Westwood Management.
Investment Strategies
We offer a broad range of investment strategies, which enables us to serve a variety of client types with different investment objectives, including five investment strategies each with over $1 billion in assets under management: our Income Opportunity, LargeCap Value, SMidCap, SmallCap Value and Emerging Markets strategies.
U.S. Value Team
The U.S. Value team employs a value-oriented approach. The common thread that permeates the team's strategies is a disciplined approach to controlling risk and preserving client assets whenever possible. The team seeks to invest in companies with high levels of free cash flow, improving returns on equity and strengthening balance sheets that are well positioned for growth but whose value is not fully recognized in the marketplace. Through investments in companies that exhibit these characteristics, we seek to generate consistently superior performance relative to our industry peers and relevant benchmark indices. This investment approach is intended to preserve capital during unfavorable periods and provide superior real returns over the long term. We have established a track record of delivering competitive risk-adjusted returns for our clients. The principal investment strategies currently managed by the U.S. Value Team are as follows:
LargeCap Value: Investments in equity securities of approximately 40 to 60 companies with market capitalizations at purchase generally over $5 billion. 
LargeCap Select: Investments in equity securities of approximately 15 to 30 companies with market capitalizations at purchase generally over $5 billion. 
SMidCap Plus: Investments in equity securities of approximately 45 to 65 companies with market capitalizations generally within the range of the Russell Midcap Index above $2 billion.
SMidCap: Investments in equity securities of approximately 50 to 70 companies with market capitalizations generally within the range of the Russell 2500 Index.
SmallCap Value: Investments in equity securities of approximately 50 to 70 companies with market capitalizations generally within the range of the Russell 2000 Index. 
AllCap Value: Investments in equity securities of approximately 50 to 80 companies with market capitalizations at purchase generally over $100 million. 
2

Income Opportunity:  Investments across a broad spectrum of income-producing securities of approximately 60 to 80 companies.
Worldwide Income Opportunity: Investments across a broad spectrum of income-producing securities of approximately 60 to 80 global companies.
Master Limited Partnership Infrastructure Renewal: Investments in the securities of approximately 25 to 35 companies that span Master Limited Partnership (“MLP”) subsectors and/or have MLP-like characteristics, with market capitalizations of any size and generally with a 7.5% maximum position size at purchase, unless the security is held by the index. If the security is held by the index, then the portfolio may hold up to its weight in the index.
Master Limited Partnership Opportunities: Investments in the securities of approximately 25 to 35 companies that span MLP subsectors and/or have MLP-like characteristics, with market capitalizations of any size and generally with a 4% maximum position size at purchase.
Master Limited Partnership and Strategic Energy: Investments in the securities of approximately 25 to 40 companies that span MLP subsectors, have MLP-like characteristics, and/or primarily involve energy-related activities, with market capitalizations of any size. Investments in publicly traded partnerships for this strategy will be limited to 25% of the portfolio.
Low Volatility Equity: Investments in the common stock or convertible securities of approximately 40 to 80 companies, seeking a lower level of volatility than traditional equity-oriented strategies. (Jointly managed by U.S. Value and Global Convertible Securities teams).
Flexible Income: Investments in securities across a company’s capital structure with the objective of achieving higher yield and lower volatility than other income alternatives strategies.
Global Convertible Securities Team
The Global Convertible Securities Team manages both long-only and liquid alternative global convertible securities strategies combining a disciplined investment process with rigorous risk management. The team's investment philosophy is based on the following beliefs:

• | the asymmetric return profile of balanced convertible bonds can provide superior risk-adjusted returns over medium- to long-term time horizons;


• | convertible securities markets are inefficient, creating opportunities to benefit from pricing anomalies;


• | a global focus provides more robust opportunities and a clearer picture of the broad convertibles universe; and


• | proprietary fundamental research is the best way to identify solid companies with attractive risk-adjusted return profiles.

The team draws on the proprietary fundamental research of all three of Westwood's investment teams in order to identify securities with attractive risk-adjusted return profiles. The principal investment strategies currently managed by the Global Convertible Securities Team are as follows:
Strategic Global Convertibles: Investments in convertible securities of approximately 60 to 90 global companies, utilizing both a top-down and bottom-up investment process. 
Market Neutral Income: Investments utilizing three primary strategies, consisting of short-duration yield-oriented portfolio of global convertible securities, a convertible arbitrage strategy, and a macro hedging strategy. 
Emerging Markets Equity Team
The Emerging Markets Equity Team emphasizes Economic Value Added (EVA) in its investment process and seeks to identify mispriced businesses that can generate sustainable earnings growth. The team offers emerging markets equity investment strategies as follows:
Emerging Markets: Investments in equity securities of approximately 70 to 90 emerging markets companies with market capitalizations generally over $500 million.
3

Emerging Markets Plus:  Investments in equity securities of approximately 70 to 90 emerging markets companies with market capitalizations generally over $1.5 billion.
Emerging Markets SMidCap:  Investments in equity securities of approximately 50 to 70 emerging markets companies with market capitalizations at purchase generally between $165 million and $9 billion.
Our ability to grow assets under management is primarily dependent on our ability to generate competitive investment performance, our success in building strong relationships with investment consulting firms and other financial intermediaries, as well as our ability to develop new client relationships while nurturing and maintaining existing relationships. We continually seek to expand assets under management by growing our existing investment strategies, as well as identifying and developing new ones. We intend to grow our investment strategies internally but may also consider acquiring new investment strategies from third parties, as discussed under “Growth Strategy” below. Our growth strategy provides clients with more investment opportunities and diversifies our assets under management, thereby reducing risk in any one area of investment and increasing our competitive ability to attract new clients. Our ten largest clients accounted for approximately 20% of our fee revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. The loss of some or all of these large clients could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations.
Advisory and Subadvisory Agreements
Westwood Management and Westwood International Advisors manage client accounts under investment advisory and subadvisory agreements. Typical for the asset management industry, these agreements are usually terminable upon short notice and provide for compensation based on the market value of client assets under management. Westwood’s advisory fees are paid quarterly in advance based on assets under management on the last day of the preceding quarter, quarterly in arrears based on assets under management on the last day of the quarter just ended, or are based on a daily or monthly analysis of assets under management for the stated period. A few clients have contractual performance-based fee arrangements, which generate additional revenues if we outperform a specified index over a specific period of time. Revenue for performance-based fees is recorded at the end of the measurement period. Revenue from advance payments is deferred and recognized over the period that services are performed. Pursuant to these agreements, Westwood provides overall investment management services, including directing investments in conformity with client-established investment objectives and restrictions. Unless otherwise directed in writing by clients, Westwood has the authority to vote all proxies with respect to securities in client portfolios.
Westwood Management and Westwood International Advisors are parties to subadvisory agreements with other investment advisers under which they perform similar services under advisory agreements. Our subadvisory fees are generally computed based upon the average daily assets under management and are payable on a monthly basis.
Westwood Management provides investment advisory services to the Westwood Funds® family of mutual funds:

● | Westwood Emerging Markets (WWEMX) | ● | Westwood Opportunistic High Yield (WWHYX)(1) 
● | Westwood Flexible Income (WFLEX) | ● | Westwood Short Duration High Yield (WHGHX)(1)

Trust
General
Through the combined efforts of the Dallas and Houston offices of Westwood Trust, we provide fiduciary and investment services to high net worth individuals and families, non-profit endowments and foundations, public and private retirement plans and individual retirement accounts (“IRAs”). Westwood Trust is chartered and regulated by the Texas Department of Banking. Fees charged by Westwood Trust are separately negotiated with each client and are typically based on assets under management. Clients generally have at least $1 million in investable assets. 
On September 6, 2017, we entered into an agreement to sell the Omaha-based component of our Wealth Management business. The sale was completed on January 12, 2018. The sale does not represent a major strategic shift in our business. Further information on the sale is included in Note 1 “Description of the Business” to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” accompanying this Report.
Fiduciary Services
Westwood Trust’s fiduciary services include but are not limited to: financial planning, wealth transfer planning, customizable trust services, trust administration and estate settlement. Westwood Trust also provides custodial services, tax reporting, accounting of trust income and principal, beneficiary and retiree distributions and safekeeping of assets.
Investment Services
Westwood Trust utilizes a consultative approach in developing a client’s portfolio asset allocation. Our approach involves examining clients' financial situations, including their current portfolio of investments, and advising clients on ways to reduce risk, enhance investment returns and strengthen their financial position based on each client’s unique objectives and constraints. Westwood Trust seeks to define and improve risk/return profiles of client investment portfolios by offering a comprehensive investment solution or enhancing clients’ existing investment strategies. Westwood Trust manages separate portfolios of equity and fixed income securities for certain agency and trust clients. Equity portfolios are generally patterned after the institutional strategies offered by Westwood Management or developed by the internal investment team in our Houston office. Fixed income portfolios consist of targeted “laddered” portfolios of primarily high-quality municipal securities.
Westwood Trust also sponsors a range of common trust funds in which client assets are commingled to achieve economies of scale. Westwood Trust’s common trust funds fall within two basic categories: personal trusts and employee benefit trusts. Westwood Trust sponsors common trust funds for most of the investment strategies managed by Westwood Management and Westwood International Advisors. Westwood Trust has also engaged SKY Harbor Capital Management, LLC and Brandywine Global Investment Management, LLC, both registered investment advisers, to subadvise our High Yield Bond and International Fixed Income common trust funds, respectively.
Westwood Trust also develops asset allocation models for certain clients utilizing mutual funds managed by Westwood Management and Westwood International Advisors, as well as from certain other mutual fund families.
Enhanced Balanced® Portfolios
Westwood Trust is a strong proponent of asset class diversification and offers its clients the ability to diversify among many different asset classes. Westwood Trust Enhanced Balanced® portfolios allocate assets among these asset classes into a customizable portfolio for clients seeking to maximize return for a given level of risk. Periodic adjustments are made to asset class weightings in Enhanced Balanced® portfolios based on historical returns, risk and correlation data, and our current capital markets outlook.
Select Equity Strategy
The Westwood Select Equity strategy aims to provide low-frequency turnover and tax efficiency to high net worth individuals. The offering allows individuals to own a diversified portfolio of best ideas from across Westwood's investment teams. The portfolios are diversified and include value and growth stocks, along with small-, mid- and large-cap stocks. Westwood Select Equity is also available without the tax efficiency overlay.

Distribution Channels
We market our services through several distribution channels to optimize the reach of our investment advisory and trust services. These channels enable us to leverage distribution infrastructures and capabilities of other financial services firms and intermediaries while focusing on our core competency of developing and managing investment strategies.
Institutional
In our institutional channel, we market our investment strategies through institutional investment consultants, financial intermediaries, managed accounts programs and directly to institutional investors. Institutional investment consultants serve as gatekeepers to the majority of corporate retirement plans, public retirement plans, endowments and foundations, which represent Westwood’s primary institutional target markets. Consultants provide guidance to their clients in setting asset allocation strategies and creating investment policies. Consultants also make recommendations for investment firms they believe can best meet their clients' investment objectives. We have established strong relationships with many global, national and regional investment consulting firms, which collectively have contributed to our being considered and hired by their clients. Continuing to enhance existing consulting firm relationships, as well as forging new relationships, increases the awareness of our services in both the consultant community and within their institutional client base.
Marketing our investment strategies to financial intermediaries, via subadvisory relationships, allows us to extend the reach of our investment advisory services to clients of other investment companies with broad, established distribution capabilities. In subadvisory arrangements, our client is generally the investment company through which our services are offered to investors, typically via mutual fund offerings. The investment company that sponsors the mutual fund is responsible for appropriate marketing, distribution and operational and accounting activities.
Managed accounts are similar in some respects to subadvisory relationships in that a third-party financial institution, such as a brokerage firm or turnkey asset management program provider, handles distribution to the end client. The end client in a managed account is typically a high net worth individual or small institution. In these arrangements, the third-party financial institution is responsible to the end client for client service, operations and accounting.
We also market our investment strategies directly to pension funds, endowments, foundations and other institutional investors.
Mutual Funds
In our mutual funds channel, we market our registered mutual funds, the Westwood Funds®, to institutional investment consultants, financial intermediaries, registered investment advisers, select broker-dealers and fund supermarkets. By leveraging our existing relationships with institutional investment consulting firms we are able to participate when their defined contribution and other retirement plan clients require a mutual fund vehicle. We also seek relationships with financial intermediaries that manage discretionary fund models in order to have our funds placed in such models. Our wholesaling group markets our funds directly to registered investment advisers, select broker-dealers and mutual fund supermarkets.
Wealth Management
In our wealth management channel, we generate awareness of our trust fiduciary and investment services through investment consultants, centers of influence, community involvement, and targeted direct marketing to high net worth individuals, families and small to medium-sized institutions. We also seek asset growth generated by referrals from existing clients.
6

Growth Strategy
We believe that we have established a strong platform to support future growth, deriving our strength in large part from the experience and capabilities of our management team and skilled investment professionals. We believe that this focused, stable team has contributed significantly to our solid investment performance, superior client service and a growing array of investment strategies. We believe that opportunities for future growth will come from our ability to:

• | generate growth from new and existing clients and consultant relationships;


• | attract and retain key employees;


• | grow assets in our existing investment strategies;


• | enhance our digital capabilities;


• | foster continued growth of the wealth management platform and distribution channel;


• | foster expanded intermediary distribution;


• | pursue strategic corporate development opportunities;


• | pursue opportunities internationally through targeted sales and relationships with international distributors and institutional investors;


• | continue to strengthen our brand name; and


• | develop or acquire new investment strategies.

Generate growth from new and existing clients and consultant relationships. As our primary business objective, we intend to maintain and enhance existing relationships with clients and investment consultants by providing solid investment performance and attentive client service. During 2018, we hired a new Head of Institutional Sales, who has already created distinct sales and service roles to improve our proactive sales and client engagement strategy. We also intend to pursue growth via targeted sales and marketing efforts that emphasize our investment philosophy, performance and superior client service. New institutional client accounts are sourced from either investment consultants or from our direct sales efforts with institutional investors. We believe that the in-depth knowledge of our firm, our people and our processes embedded in our consultant relationships, as well as in existing and prospective client relationships, is a key factor when being considered for new client investment mandates.
Attract and retain key employees. To achieve our investment performance and client relationship objectives, we must be able to attract and retain talented professionals. We believe that we have created a workplace environment in which motivated, performance-driven and client-oriented individuals can thrive. As a public company, we offer our employees a compensation program that includes strong equity incentives to closely align their success with that of our clients and stockholders. We believe that these factors are critical to maintaining a stable, client-focused environment that can support significant future growth.
Grow assets in our existing investment strategies. We have significant capacity to manage additional assets across our existing range of investment strategies, which we have continued to expand. We have developed a range of institutional investment strategies by building on the core competencies of our U.S. Value Team. Our Emerging Markets Equity Team provides equity strategies that focus on emerging markets that have experienced strong investor demand, and we believe they provide additional growth opportunities. Our Global Convertible Securities Team manages a long-only strategy called Strategic Global Convertibles and a market neutral strategy called Market Neutral Income. We have the team in place to support these investment strategies and, with strong investment performance, we believe that demand for these strategies can provide meaningful growth for our assets under management.
Enhance our digital capabilities. Over the past three years we have invested significant capital to enhance our automation and digital efficiency. We moved our technology infrastructure to secure, cloud-based access, created a data warehouse to improve our investment operations work flow and upgraded our trade order management and trade compliance systems. We are currently in the process of digitizing our portfolio accounting and reconciliation system and developing a fully digital platform for our institutional and wealth management clients. We believe these investments position us to improve efficiencies and better respond to consumer demand for digital interaction with investment advisors.

Foster continued growth of the wealth management platform and distribution channel. Westwood Trust serves small to medium-sized institutions as well as high net worth individuals and families. We anticipate continued interest from clients and prospects in our diversified, highly attentive service model. A significant percentage of asset growth at Westwood Trust stems from referrals, as well as gathering additional assets from existing clients. We believe that our Enhanced Balanced® strategy, which offers diversified exposure to multiple asset classes in a comprehensive manner, our Select Equity strategy, which offers diversified equity exposure in a tax-efficient manner, and our offerings for separately managed portfolios will all provide opportunities for growth. Additionally, we are exploring opportunities to offer passive investment management strategies to enhance our wealth management client experience.
Foster expanded intermediary distribution. During 2018 we hired a new Head of Intermediary Sales in order to expand and target our geographic approach and focus coverage for intermediary distribution. We plan to expand our intermediary sales team to extend our coverage and accelerate growth in top markets. We believe that providing investors access to our mutual funds is a key component to achieving asset growth in the defined contribution and retirement marketplaces as well as with registered investment advisers. 
Pursue strategic corporate development opportunities. We evaluate strategic corporate development opportunities to augment organic growth. We may pursue various transactions, including acquisitions of asset management firms, mutual funds, wealth management firms, or other financial institutions, as well as hiring investment professionals or teams. We consider opportunities to enhance our existing operations, expand our range of investment strategies and services or further develop our distribution capabilities. By acquiring investment firms or by hiring investment professionals or teams that successfully manage investment strategies beyond our current expertise, we can both attract new clients and provide existing clients with an even more diversified range of investment strategies. We may also consider forging alliances with other financial services firms to leverage our core competency of developing and managing investment strategies with alliance partners that can provide enhanced distribution capabilities or additional service offerings.
Pursue opportunities internationally through targeted sales and relationships with international distributors and institutional investors. In recent years we have increased our sales efforts outside of the U.S.  As of December 31, 2018, non-U.S. clients represented approximately 20% of our assets under management compared with 16% as of December 31, 2014.  The growth in our non-U.S. client base has primarily been a function of the broadening of our range of investment strategies to include Emerging Markets equity and Global Convertible Securities. In addition, we established a UCITS platform in 2013 for non-U.S. investors. We intend to continue our sales efforts outside of the U.S. We have also engaged a third-party distribution firm focused on intermediary and institutional distribution throughout Continental Europe. We may consider forging alliances with additional international financial services firms or partners to obtain enhanced distribution capabilities and greater access to global customers. Additionally, we continue to target select institutional clients around the globe.
Continue to strengthen our brand name. We believe that the strength of our brand name has been a key component to our long-term success in the investment industry and will be instrumental to our future success. We have developed strong brand name largely through our performance, coupled with high profile coverage in investment publications and electronic media. Several of our investment professionals have been visible in print and electronic media, and we will continue to look for creative ways to strengthen our brand name and reputation in our target markets.
Develop or acquire new investment strategies. We continue to look for opportunities to expand the range of investment strategies that we offer to existing and prospective clients. We may consider internally-developed strategies that extend our existing investment process to new markets, and we may also consider externally acquired investment strategies. An expanded range of investment strategies offers additional ways to serve our client base, generating more diversified revenue streams, as well as providing asset and revenue growth opportunities.

Competition
We are subject to substantial and growing competition in all aspects of our business. Barriers to entry in the asset management business are relatively low, and we expect to face a growing number of competitors. Although no single company dominates the asset management industry, many companies are larger, better known and have greater resources.
We compete with other asset management firms on the basis of investment strategies offered, their investment performance both in absolute terms and relative to peer groups, quality of service, fees charged, the level and type of compensation offered to key employees and the manner in which investment strategies are marketed. Many of our competitors offer more investment strategies and services and have substantially greater assets under management.
We compete against numerous investment dealers, banks, insurance companies, mutual fund companies, exchange-traded funds, brokerage and investment firms and others that sell equity funds, taxable income funds, tax-free investments and other investment products. In addition, the allocation of assets by many investors from active equity investment to index funds, fixed income or similar asset classes has enhanced the ability of firms offering non-equity asset classes and passive equity management to compete effectively with us. The demand for passive strategies with low-fee structures has rapidly increased, and investors more frequently demand customized and personalized strategies to fit their investment needs. This shift in the marketplace may benefit competitors that offer certain investment vehicles that we do not currently offer. In summary, our competitive landscape is intense and dynamic, which may affect our ability to compete successfully in the future as an independent company.
Additionally, most prospective clients perform a thorough review of an investment manager’s background, investment policies and performance before committing assets to that manager. In many cases, prospective clients invite a number of competing firms to make presentations. The process of obtaining a new client typically takes twelve to eighteen months from the time of the initial contact. While we have achieved success in competing for new clients, it is a process to which we dedicate significant resources over an extended period, with no certainty of winning.
Regulation
Virtually all aspects of our business are subject to federal, state and other non-U.S. jurisdictions' laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients. Under such laws and regulations, agencies that regulate investment advisers have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit advisers from carrying on their business if they fail to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions include suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of investment adviser and other registrations, censures and fines. We believe that we are in compliance with all material laws and regulations.
Westwood Management
Our business is subject to regulation at federal and state levels by the SEC and other regulatory bodies. Westwood Management Corp. and Westwood Advisors, L.L.C. are registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Investment Advisers Act”) and under the laws of various states. As registered investment advisers, Westwood Management Corp. and Westwood Advisors, L.L.C. are regulated and subject to examination by the SEC. The Investment Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers, including fiduciary duties, record keeping, operational and marketing requirements and disclosure obligations. Westwood Management Corp. also acts as adviser to the Westwood Funds®, a family of mutual funds registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”). As an adviser to a registered investment company, Westwood Management Corp. must comply with the Investment Company Act and related regulations. The Investment Company Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment companies, including requirements relating to operations, fees charged, sales, accounting, record keeping, disclosure, governance, and restrictions on transactions with affiliates. Under SEC rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to the federal securities laws, we are subject to periodic SEC examinations. The SEC can institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, ranging from censure to termination of an investment adviser’s registration. The failure of Westwood Management Corp. and Westwood Advisors, L.L.C. to comply with SEC requirements could have a material adverse effect on Westwood. We must also comply with anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, as subsequently amended and reauthorized (the “Patriot Act”). We believe that we are in compliance with the regulations under the Investment Advisers Act, the Investment Company Act and the Patriot Act.
9

As an investment adviser, we have a fiduciary duty to our clients. The SEC has interpreted that duty to impose standards, requirements and limitations on, among other things: trading of client accounts, allocation of investment opportunities among clients, use of soft dollars, execution of transactions and recommendations to clients. We manage accounts for our clients with the authority to buy and sell securities, select broker-dealers to execute trades and negotiate brokerage commission rates. We may receive soft dollar credits from certain broker-dealers that are used to pay for brokerage and research-related products, which reduces certain company operating expenses. We intend to use soft dollars to pay for only those brokerage and research related products and services that fall within the safe harbor provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If our ability to use soft dollars were reduced or eliminated as a result of the implementation of statutory amendments or new regulations, our operating expenses would increase.
Westwood Trust
Westwood Trust operates in a highly regulated environment and is subject to extensive supervision and examination. As a Texas chartered trust company, Westwood Trust is subject to the Texas Finance Code (the “Finance Code”), the rules and regulations promulgated under the Finance Code and supervision by the Texas Department of Banking. These laws are intended primarily for the protection of Westwood Trust’s clients and creditors rather than for the benefit of investors. The Finance Code provides for and regulates a variety of matters, such as:

• | minimum capital maintenance requirements;


• | restrictions on dividends;


• | restrictions on investments of restricted capital;


• | lending and borrowing limitations;


• | prohibitions against engaging in certain activities;


• | periodic fiduciary and information technology examinations by the Texas Department of Banking Commissioner;


• | furnishing periodic financial statements to the Texas Department of Banking Commissioner;


• | fiduciary record keeping requirements; and


• | prior regulatory approval for certain corporate events (such as mergers, the sale or purchase of all or substantially all trust company assets and transactions transferring control of a trust company).

The Finance Code also gives the Banking Commissioner broad regulatory powers (including penalties and civil and administrative actions) if the trust company violates certain provisions of the Finance Code, including implementing conservatorship or closure if Westwood Trust is determined to be in a “hazardous condition” (as defined by applicable law). Westwood Trust’s failure to comply with the Finance Code could have a material adverse effect on Westwood.
Westwood Trust is limited by the Finance Code in the payment of dividends to undivided profits, which is described as the part of equity capital equal to the balance of net profits, income, gains and losses since formation minus subsequent distributions to stockholders and transfers to surplus or capital under share dividends or appropriate board resolutions. At the discretion of its Board of Directors, Westwood Trust has made quarterly and special dividend payments to Westwood Holdings Group, Inc. out of undivided profits.
Westwood International Advisors

Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
We are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), and to its related regulations insofar as we are a “fiduciary” under ERISA with respect to some clients. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code impose certain duties on fiduciaries under ERISA or on entities that provide services to ERISA plan clients and prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients.
Tax Reform Act
On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Reform Act”). The legislation significantly changed U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates and creating a territorial tax system with a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Reform Act reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate, effective January 1, 2018. 
We have recognized the incremental tax impacts related to deemed repatriated earnings and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and included these amounts in our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. We completed the accounting for our 2017 U.S. corporate income tax return in the third quarter of 2018 and made no significant changes to the amounts provisionally recognized. Further information on the tax impacts of the Tax Reform Act is included in Note 7 “Income Taxes” to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” accompanying this Report.
Employees
At December 31, 2018, we had 182 full-time employees (164 based in the United States and 18 based in Canada). No employees are represented by a labor union, and we believe our employee relations are favorable.
