i.Automotive
Growth in automotive semiconductor sales relies on global vehicle sales and production trends and the increase in semiconductor content per vehicle, which is being driven by the proliferation of electronic features throughout the vehicle. Despite the decline in vehicles sales and production in 2020 due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 and the moderate growth in 2021 and 2022 due to the global supply crisis, the increase in semiconductor content per vehicle continued. 
We believe three mega-trends will drive the semiconductor content increase in the future: Autonomous driving, electrification and the service oriented car. Each of the megatrends involve new functions and each new function requires new technologies. The path to full autonomy is driving the increase of driver assistance systems in the car already today. In the same way, strict emissions regulations as well as consumer willingness for energy efficient cars are accelerating the penetration of electrification, which has been even more intensified during the pandemic, with OEMs prioritizing investments in this area. Last but not least, many consumers want their cars to be service oriented, hyper-connected, configurable and upgradeable, in the same way as they are used to with their smartphones. 
Semiconductor content per vehicle continues to increase due to government regulation of safety and emissions, standardization of higher-end options across a greater number of vehicle classes as well as consumer demand for greater fuel efficiency, advanced safety, multimedia applications and connectivity. Automotive safety features are evolving from passive safety systems to active safety systems with Advanced Driving Assisted Systems (ADAS) such as radar and vision systems. Semiconductor content is also increasing in engine management and fuel economy applications, like Battery Management Systems (BMS). Comfort and convenience systems and user interface applications, as well as infotainment features such as digital audio broadcasting are also areas with high semiconductor content increases. In addition, the use of networking in automotive applications continues to increase as various subsystems communicate within the automobile and with external devices and networks. Furthermore, we believe networking will play a key role in the electrical/electronic architecture transformation towards domain and zonal architectures. Smart car access, automotive Ultra-Wideband (UWB) and Near-Field Communication (NFC) are gaining ground in automotive as well, enabling the connection of vehicles and car keys to portable devices and the infrastructure. Data integrity and security hardware features for safeguarding memory, communication and system data are also increasing in importance.  
Due to the high degree of regulatory scrutiny and safety requirements, the automotive semiconductor market is characterized by stringent qualification processes, zero defect quality processes, functionally safe design architecture, high reliability, extensive design-in timeframes and long product life cycles, which results in significant barriers to entry. 
ii.Industrial & IoT
The world is becoming smarter, more connected and more data driven, and the Industrial & IoT market sits at the center of this global digital transformation. The Industrial & IoT market is highly fragmented with a diverse collection of products and applications such as factory automation, smart home, smart appliances, home entertainment, smart retail, power and energy and medical electronics. 
Growth in the Industrial market is driven by the replacement of traditional mechanical equipment by smart, energy-saving and connected electronic equipment using various sensors, processors, connectivity, analog and security chipsets that align well with NXP’s ability to provide a complete range of processing, connectivity and secure solutions. Reducing carbon emissions (global net zero emission commitments) will likely also be a key growth driver with large transformations expected of our energy systems. Factories and homes will need to rely much more on renewable energy (e.g., solar, wind) and increase efficient use of energy. The way we generate and store energies will likely be more distributed. The energy ecosystem needs to develop and ensure smart, efficient and reliable power delivery.
In IoT, growth is driven by the increasing use of high-performance edge and media devices (e.g., home entertainment, connected home assistants, home control and security) and low power IoT nodes (e.g. smart home, hearables, health trackers) where NXP scalable solutions across the entire embedded processing spectrum are ideally suited. Working and learning from home during the COVID-19 pandemic has been a major demand driver for smart home devices, computing peripherals, home entertainment and gaming consoles within our Industrial & IoT business.
The increase in productivity with real-time insights and efficient processes for factory automation, the enhancement in consumer convenience, security and comfort for smart homes, the reduction of resource consumption and better energy efficiency for smart factories and cities, the increase in performance of rich media content in smart consumer devices and the need for better health prevention and monitoring solutions (wearables, smart patches and smart drug delivery devices) to help ensure the future health of millions of people are some of the key use-cases driving growth in Industrial & IoT. 
Finally, with the growing number of connected devices, latency, privacy and bandwidth have become critical limiting factors and Edge computing solves this by bringing the intelligence closer to the source. Security and tamper-detection capabilities are also becoming essential features of these Industrial & IoT solutions. 
iii.Mobile
Mobile includes applications such as smartphones, feature phones, tablets, wearables and mobile accessories. NXP has a strong focus on mobile wallet, Ultra-Wideband (UWB) and specialty custom analog solutions. The demand for faster speeds, improved battery life, fast charging, mobile wallets, highly secure localization and sensing technology, mobile transit and authentication is driving increased semiconductor content for NXP. The growth in this market is mainly driven by the increasing attach rate of these features across devices, vendors and regions, from flagship smartphones down to feature phones, from developed countries to emerging regions. UWB, thanks to its unique precision, robustness, and reliability, is emerging as a secure, fine-ranging technology capable of enabling a wide range of innovative location-based user experiences. The technology is gaining momentum thanks to wider chipset availability, adoption across various devices by multiple brands, and the formation of a strong UWB ecosystem across the whole supply chain and NXP is well positioned in this market. 
iv.Communication Infrastructure & Other
The Communication Infrastructure & Other end market is a combination of three different application markets, namely 5G networks, digital network communications and secure edge identification solutions. 
The transition to 5G and the cloudification of the network present a significant opportunity for NXP. More base stations are needed and massive MIMO radio technology - which provides better throughput and better spectrum efficiency - is greatly expanding the number of antennas and power amplifiers needed. Small cells are also deployed to improve coverage and capacity of wireless networks. In power amplification, as more bandwidth and higher frequencies are needed, we observe an increasing adoption of GaN technology because of its higher power output and efficiency.
Workplaces are evolving from offices to homes, and consumers and enterprises need to adapt to changing working conditions, leading to increasing demand for better digital communication capabilities and digital content. This creates strong growth in the network communications market. Meanwhile, billions of connected devices exchange more and more data, leading to strong demand for device edge and cloud processing solutions. 
Finally, in secure edge identification solutions, NXP has extensive experience providing customers with solutions for applications demanding the highest security and reliability (ePassports, eID credentials, transportation & payment cards and RFID solutions). Further digitalization of governmental services, the trend towards secure contactless payment and the need to improve tracking, traceability and authentication of products are driving demand across these applications.

We provide several categories of semiconductor-based environmental and inertial sensors for the Automotive market, including pressure, inertial, magnetic and gyroscopic sensors that provide orientation detection, gesture recognition, tilt to scroll functionality and position detection. 
Manufacturing 
We manufacture integrated circuits and discrete semiconductors through a combination of wholly owned manufacturing facilities, a manufacturing facility operated jointly with another semiconductor company and third-party foundries and assembly and test subcontractors. We manage our manufacturing assets together through one centralized organization to ensure we realize scale benefits in asset utilization, purchasing volumes and overhead leverage across businesses. 
The manufacturing of a semiconductor involves several phases of production, which can be broadly divided into “front-end” and “back-end” processes. Front-end processes take place at highly complex wafer manufacturing facilities (called fabrication plants or “wafer fabs”), and involve the imprinting of substrate silicon wafers with the precise circuitry required for semiconductors to function. The front-end production cycle requires high levels of precision and involves as many as 300 process steps. Back-end processes involve the assembly, test and packaging of semiconductors in a form suitable for distribution. In contrast to the highly complex front-end process, back-end processing is generally less complicated, and as a result we tend to determine the location of our back-end facilities based more on cost factors than on technical considerations. 
We primarily focus our internal and joint venture wafer manufacturing operations on running proprietary specialty process technologies that enable us to differentiate our products on key performance features, and we generally outsource wafer manufacturing in process technologies that are available at third-party wafer foundries when it is economical to do so. In addition, we increasingly focus our in-house manufacturing on our competitive 8-inch wafer facilities, which predominantly run manufacturing processes in the 140 nanometer, 180 nanometer and 250 nanometer process nodes. This focus increases our return on invested capital and reduces capital expenditures. 
Our front-end manufacturing facilities use a broad range of production processes and proprietary design methods, including complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS), bipolar, bipolar CMOS (BiCMOS) and double-diffused metal on silicon oxide semiconductor (DMOS) technologies. Our wafer fabs produce semiconductors with line widths ranging from 90 nanometers to 3 microns for integrated circuits and 0.5 microns to greater than 4 microns for discretes. This broad technology portfolio enables us to meet increasing demand from customers for system solutions, which require a variety of technologies. 
Our back-end manufacturing facilities test and package many different types of products using a wide variety of processes. To optimize flexibility, we use shared technology platforms for our back-end assembly operations. Most of our assembly and test activities are maintained in-house. 
The following table shows selected key information with respect to our major front-end and back-end facilities:

1)    Joint venture with TSMC; we are entitled to 60% of the joint venture’s annual capacity. 
We use a large number of raw materials in our front- and back-end manufacturing processes, including silicon wafers, chemicals, gases, lead frames, substrates, molding compounds and various types of precious and other metals. Our most important raw materials are the raw, or substrate, silicon wafers we use to make our semiconductors. We purchase these wafers, which must meet exacting specifications, from a limited number of suppliers in the geographic region in which our fabrication facilities are located. At our wholly owned fabrication plants, we use raw wafers ranging from 6 inches to 8 inches in size. Our SSMC wafer fab facility, which produces 8 inch wafers, is jointly owned by TSMC and ourselves. Emerging fabrication technologies employ larger wafer sizes and, accordingly, we expect that our production requirements will in the future shift towards larger substrate wafers. 
We typically source our other raw materials in a similar fashion as our wafers, although our portfolio of suppliers is more diverse. Some of our suppliers provide us with materials on a just-in-time basis, which permits us to reduce our procurement costs and the negative cash flow consequences of maintaining inventories, but exposes us to potential supply chain interruptions. We purchase most of our raw materials on the basis of fixed price contracts. 
Over the past two years, semiconductor supply chains have been constrained. As a result, there has been a tendency towards longer term supply contracts with suppliers in exchange for capacity. From an operational perspective, all of our manufacturing facilities continue to operate around the world in accordance with guidance issued by local and national government authorities.
Sales, Marketing and Customers 
We market our products and solutions worldwide to a variety of OEMs, contract manufacturers and distributors. We generate demand for our products by delivering product solutions to our customers, and supporting their system design-in activities by providing application architecture expertise and local field application engineering support. 
Our sales and marketing teams are organized into five regions, which are EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa), the Americas, Japan, South Korea, and China and Asia Pacific. These sales regions are responsible for managing customer relationships and creating demand for our solutions through the full ecosystem development. In addition, our sales and marketing teams in the regions partner with our distributors and our large number of mass market customers. 
Our sales and marketing strategy focuses on key defined verticals in Automotive, Mobile, Industrial & IoT and Communication Infrastructure, deepening our relationship with our top OEMs and electronic manufacturing service customers, expanding our reach to our mass market customers, startups and our distribution partners and becoming their preferred supplier, which we believe assists us in reducing sales volatility in challenging markets. We have long-standing customer relationships with most of our customers. Our 10 largest OEM end customers, some of whom are supplied by distributors, in alphabetical order, are Apple, Aptiv, Bosch, Continental, Denso, Harman Auto, Hyundai, Samsung, Visteon, and Vitesco. We also have a strong position with our distribution partners, including our three largest, Arrow, Avnet and WT Micro. 
Our revenue is primarily the sum of our direct sales to OEMs plus our distributors’ resale of NXP products. Avnet accounted for 20% of our revenue in 2022 and 18% in 2021. No other distributor accounted for greater than 10% of our revenue. No OEM for which we had direct sales to accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in 2022 or 2021. 
Research and Development 
We believe that our future success depends on our ability to both improve our existing products and to develop new products for both existing and new markets. We direct our research and development efforts largely to the development of new semiconductor solutions where we see significant opportunities for growth. We target applications that require stringent overall system and subsystem performance. As new and challenging applications proliferate, we believe that many of these applications will benefit from our solutions. We have assembled a global team of highly skilled semiconductor and embedded software design engineers with expertise in RF, analog, power management, interface, security and digital processing. 
To outpace market growth we invest in research and development to extend or create leading market positions, with an emphasis on fast growing sizable market segments, such as ADAS, in-vehicle networks and power management, as well as Edge computing to support the successful deployment in the IoT with our cross-over processing technology, but also in emerging markets, such as massive MIMO in RF Power and mmWave for 5G. In addition, we invest a few percent of our total research and development expenditures in research activities that develop fundamental new technologies or product categories that could contribute significantly to our company's growth in the future. 
We annually perform a fundamental review of our business portfolio and our related new product and technology development opportunities in order to decide on changes in the allocation of our research and development resources. For products targeting established markets, we evaluate our research and development expenditures based on clear business need and risk assessments. For break-through technologies and new market opportunities, we look at the strategic fit and synergies with the rest of our portfolio and the size of the potential addressable market. Overall, we allocate our research and development to maintain a healthy mix of emerging growth and mature businesses. 
Intellectual Property 
The creation and use of intellectual property is a key aspect of our strategy to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace. We seek to protect our proprietary technologies by obtaining patents, trademarks, domain names, 
retaining trade secrets and defending, enforcing and utilizing our intellectual property rights, where appropriate. We believe this strategy allows us to preserve the advantages of our products and technologies, and helps us to improve the return on our investment in research and development. We have a broad portfolio of approximately 9,500 patent families (each patent family includes all patents and patent applications originating from the same invention). To protect confidential technical information and software, we rely on copyright and trade secret law and enter into confidentiality agreements as applicable. In situations where we believe that a third party has infringed on our intellectual property, we enforce our rights through all available legal means to the extent that we determine the benefits of such actions to outweigh the costs and risks involved. 
We own a number of trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business. Where we consider it desirable, we develop names for our new products and secure trademark protection. Our trademarks allow us to further distinguish our company and our products and are important in our relationships with customers, suppliers, partners and end-users. 
While our patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights constitute valuable assets, we do not view any individual right or asset as material to our operations as a whole. We believe it is the combination of our proprietary technology, patents, know-how and other intellectual property rights and assets that creates an advantage for our business. 
In addition to obtaining our own patents and other intellectual property rights, we have entered into licensing agreements and other arrangements authorizing us to use intellectual property rights, confidential technical information, software and other technology owned by third parties. We also engage, in certain instances, in licensing and selling of certain of our technology, patents and other intellectual property rights. 
Competition 
We compete with many different semiconductor companies on a global basis, including with both integrated device manufacturers (“IDMs”) as well as fabless companies. Nearly all our competitors invest extensively in research and development, manufacturing, sales and marketing capabilities across a broad spectrum of product lines. Many of our competitors are focused on single applications or market segments. Most of our competitors compete with us with respect to some, but not all, of our product lines. 
Our primary key public competitors in alphabetical order include, but are not limited to, Analog Devices Inc., Infineon Technologies AG, Intel Corp., Marvell Technology, Mediatek Inc., Microchip Technology Inc., NVIDIA Corp., Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corp., STMicroelectronics NV and Texas Instruments Incorporated. 
The basis on which we compete varies across end markets and geographic regions. This includes competing on the basis of our ability to develop new products and the underlying intellectual property in a timely manner to meet customer requirements in terms of product features, quality, performance, warranty, availability and cost. In addition, we are asked to deliver full system capabilities which include multiple NXP devices and enabling software. This requires in-depth knowledge of specific applications in target markets in order to develop robust system solutions and qualified customer support resources.

We invite team members to share their feedback on a variety of factors, including engagement, strategy, culture, leadership, continuous improvement, collaboration, execution, ownership, work environment, support and diversity, equality and inclusion. Insights from our survey equip us to improve the team member experience as well as our policies and processes. 
We prioritize team member retention and closely monitor voluntary attrition as an indicator of engagement. This attrition is also compared to industry norms to ensure we are effectively retaining our employees throughout the world. During calendar 2022, our voluntary attrition rate was 7.5% for IDL, 18.1% for our DL population and 11.7% of the total population, a slight reduction in total year over year. We managed several initiatives centered around retention for strategic roles and top-performing talent. We also have broad-based programs targeting all team members ensuring that we are retaining our talent over the longer term. 
Diversity, Equality and Inclusion
At NXP, the foundation of our values is trust and respect to ensure our inclusive culture. We recognize the importance of diversity, equality, and inclusion and respect the unique talents, experiences, backgrounds, cultures and ideas of our team members. Our diversity, equality and inclusion approach is centered around 
•Ensuring leadership commitment and accountability; 
•Building and sustaining a qualified and diverse talent pipeline and equitable processes; and 
•Fostering an inclusive culture and a sense of belonging to attract and retain the best talent.
NXP continues to contribute resources focused on driving cultural awareness across the Company, which is spearheaded by NXP’s Vice President and Head of Diversity, Equality and Inclusion. The Human Resources and Compensation Committee of our Board provides oversight of our policies, programs and initiatives focusing on human capital management, including workforce diversity, equality and inclusion.
NXP Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) enable our culture and inclusive work environment, as we work to ensure diversity of thought throughout our company and bring unique perspectives and skills to help those in our communities. Today, we have nine primary ERGs, with representation in Asia, Europe, Mexico and the United States. Membership and participation in ERGs is open to all team members, and global engagement is encouraged. To track the progress of our growing ERGs, we measure membership, programming and team member engagement for each group.
To support our diversity, equality and inclusion approach and demonstrate our commitment to transparency and accountability, we have established the aspirational 2025 diversity, equality and inclusion goals listed below to improve global gender representation and minority race and ethnicity representation in the United States. We continue to focus on hiring, developing, and retaining team members across all global sites to meet our 2025 representation goals. In a competitive hiring market, our overall employee population grew by 11% in 2022. Of this increased population, compared to 2021 there was a 1% increase with women in the global indirect labor workforce, 2% increase with women in R&D positions, 3% increase with women of executive positions and the percent of women in the global workforce remained the same in 2022 compared to 2021. While we present gender representation data by men and women, we acknowledge this is not fully encompassing of all gender identities.

2025 Diversity, Equality, & Inclusion Goals
40% Women in Overall Global Workforce | 30% Women in Global Indirect Labor Workforce | 20% Women in Executive Positions* | 25% Women in R&D Positions | 50% Minority Representation in the United States*


2022 Diversity, Equality, & Inclusion Performance
37% | 25% | 16% | 19% | 51%

* Executive positions are defined as individuals at the level of Vice President and above. Minority representation includes team members who self-identify as Asian, Hispanic or Latino, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Pacific Islander or two or more races. We also include within minority representation team members who have not self-identified an ethnicity.
Talent Development and Investing in the Future
NXP is committed to a 70/20/10 continuous learning model, including mechanisms for learning through on-the-job experiences (70%), learning through others (20%), and learning through education (10%). Using a blend of internally designed and externally sourced courses and learning resources, we offer our team members around the globe a variety of training programs that provide real-time learning opportunities in support of key business processes, requirements and initiatives. We also provide a library of on-demand skills development and microlearning resources to all our team members. 
We work to create developmental opportunities for our team members through stretch assignments, project roles, cross-functional interactions, cross-geography engagements, and both temporary and longer-term job rotations – all of which are used to stimulate core skill and leadership competency development, to provide on-the-job learning experience, and to fuel career growth. 
We also believe that our commitment to our internship programs and university partnerships are a key contributor to developing the new generation of talent, including engineers in our industry and company, and provide a pipeline of recent college graduates into our talent pool. Through our partnerships with universities across the world, we fund and support advanced research programs and projects that demonstrate our commitment to investing in the future of not only technology, but also students' knowledge and skills. 
Compensation and Benefits
We provide total rewards packages that include market competitive base salary, as well as opportunities to earn short-term cash incentives and equity-based incentives. In addition, in an effort to meet the specific needs of our team members and their families, we offer locally competitive benefits programs, which vary by country/region, and include an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, retirement programs, healthcare and insurance benefits, allowances, paid time off, family leave, our flexible work arrangement program, and other team member assistance programs. 
NXP’s compensation programs are designed to attract the best talent and drive performance across all areas of our diverse workforce. NXP is committed to managing all reward-based compensation programs, including merit increases, incentive program payouts and long-term incentive awards, to deliver on our pay-for-performance philosophy. Rewarding performance is a critical foundation for our overall compensation program.
We believe that pay decisions should be made on three factors: external (i.e. market conditions), internal equity, and employee performance/contributions. We have developed a proactive process to evaluate each reward-based compensation program in real time and provide leaders with feedback to create more visibility into fair and equitable compensation while decisions are being made. NXP also utilizes third-party data to formulate compensation and benefits programs that are fair, equitable and competitive. We then empower leaders to recognize both individual and team accomplishments through a variety of compensation programs.
Since 2022, we have linked a portion of our executive and employee compensation to our ESG Goals. For more information, see our 2023 Proxy Statement and the ESG Goals section in the Corporate Sustainability Report.
Employee Health and Safety
We are committed to the safety of our employees, and we continuously assess safety risks globally to ensure workplace risks are mitigated. We are certified to the ISO 45001 Occupational Health and Safety Management System, and have developed robust safety programs and initiatives to safeguard our workforce. In 2022, as a follow-up to a previous survey, we conducted a global survey on employee safety, inquiring about opportunities for improvement and asking employees about their comfort level when raising safety concerns. The follow-up survey had a participation rate of approximately 80% and the responses to all questions were more favorable than those provided on the previous survey. In particular, 94% of our employees felt that safety concerns are a high priority for NXP and 98% of employees felt that safety starts with them. We used the results from the follow-up survey to identify improvement opportunities, and have started working at our sites and locations to address these opportunities.
For the past three years, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has made it all the more important to maintain employee health and safety, and we have effectively managed our health-and-safety programs over this period. During the height of the pandemic, we hosted several successful vaccination drives in a number of countries where our employees live and work. As community conditions improved, we developed a global program for flexible work arrangements, offering eligible employees the option to perform a combination of onsite and remote work. We believe this approach – emphasizing onsite safety, vaccination availability, and the option to work remotely – addresses the safety needs of our workforce while ensuring the robust continuity of our operations.
Employee Representation
A number of our team members are members of a labor union and in various countries, local law requires us to inform and consult with employee representatives on matters relating to labor conditions. We have not experienced any material strikes or labor disputes in the past and consider our employee relations to be good.
We also have employee-lead worker’s councils in various countries that provide input and oversight to many of the decisions made on behalf of employees.
Climate and Environment
As part of our commitment to reducing emissions and conserving the earth’s natural resources, we have made the environment a key pillar in our Sustainability Policy and corporate strategy. We set company-wide environmental targets to optimize our use of resources, minimize waste and continuously improve. We periodically set and reset targets, and publish mid- and long-term targets on carbon footprint reduction and renewable energy consumption, as well as water and waste recycling.
See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of potential global environmental risks that may adversely affect our business operations, such as climate change or natural disasters.
Our commitment to enabling a smarter, more sustainable world goes beyond our operations, and includes developing innovative product solutions that support the sustainability goals and objectives of our stakeholders. We monitor developments of global legislation by tracking current discussions, timelines, and the likelihood of new implementations. During the design and development of our new product solutions, we emphasize these potential requirements to coincide with new product introductions. By minimizing the environmental impact of our products in the early stages of the design process, we enable sustainable, green technology for NXP and our customers.
