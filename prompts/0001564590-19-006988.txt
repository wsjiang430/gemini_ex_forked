Company Overview
 We are a leader in the design, engineering and manufacturing of critical fluid delivery subsystems and components for semiconductor capital equipment. Our product offerings include gas and chemical delivery subsystems, collectively known as fluid delivery subsystems, which are key elements of the process tools used in the manufacturing of semiconductor devices. Our gas delivery subsystems deliver, monitor and control precise quantities of the specialized gases used in semiconductor manufacturing processes such as etch and deposition. Our chemical delivery subsystems precisely blend and dispense the reactive liquid chemistries used in semiconductor manufacturing processes such as chemical-mechanical planarization, electroplating, and cleaning. We also manufacture precision machined components, weldments, and proprietary products for use in fluid delivery systems for direct sales to our customers. This vertically integrated portion of our business is primarily focused on metal and plastic parts that are used in gas and chemical systems, respectively.
 Fluid delivery subsystems ensure accurate measurement and uniform delivery of specialty gases and chemicals at critical steps in the semiconductor manufacturing processes. Any malfunction or material degradation in fluid delivery reduces yields and increases the likelihood of manufacturing defects in these processes. Most OEMs outsource all or a portion of the design, engineering and manufacturing of their gas delivery subsystems to a few specialized suppliers, including us. Additionally, many OEMs are also increasingly outsourcing the design, engineering and manufacturing of their chemical delivery subsystems due to the increased fluid expertise required to manufacture these subsystems. Outsourcing these subsystems has allowed OEMs to leverage the suppliers’ highly specialized engineering, design and production skills while focusing their internal resources on their own value-added processes. We believe that this outsourcing trend has enabled OEMs to reduce their costs and development time, as well as provide growth opportunities for specialized subsystems suppliers like us.
 1


Our goal is to be a leading supplier of outsourced fluid delivery subsystems and components to OEMs engaged in manufacturing capital equipment to produce semiconductors and to leverage our technology and products to expand our addressable markets. To achieve this goal, we engage with our customers early in their design and development processes and utilize our deep engineering resources and operating expertise to jointly create innovative and advanced solutions that meet the current and future needs of our customers. These collaborations frequently involve our engineers working at our customers’ sites and serving as an extension of our customers’ product design teams. We employ this approach with three of the largest manufacturers of semiconductor capital equipment in the world. We believe this approach enables us to design subsystems that meet the precise specifications our customers demand, allows us to often be the sole supplier of these subsystems during the initial production ramp and positions us to be the preferred supplier for the full five to ten-year lifespan of the process tool.
 The broad technical expertise of our engineering team, coupled with our early customer engagement approach, enables us to offer innovative and reliable solutions to complex fluid delivery challenges. With two decades of experience developing complex fluid delivery subsystems and meeting the constantly changing production requirements of leading semiconductor OEMs, we have developed expertise in fluid delivery that we offer to our OEM customers. In addition, our capital efficient model and the integration of our business systems with those of our customers provides us the flexibility to fulfill increased demand and meet changing customer requirements with relatively low levels of capital expenditures. With an aim to superior customer service, we have a global footprint with many facilities strategically located in close proximity to our customers. We have long standing relationships with top tier OEM customers, including Lam Research, Applied Materials, and ASML, which were our three largest customers by sales in 2018.
 We grew our revenue from continuing operations by 26% to $823.6 million in 2018 from $655.9 million in 2017 (hereinafter, all references to “sales” or “revenue” relates to net sales from continuing operations, unless explicitly stated otherwise). We generated net income from continuing operations of $57.9 million, $56.9 million, and $20.8 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. We generated adjusted net income from continuing operations of $75.1 million, $65.1 million, and $31.6 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. See Item 7 – Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Non-GAAP Results for a discussion of adjusted net income from continuing operations, an accompanying presentation of the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, net income from continuing operations, and a reconciliation of the differences between adjusted net income from continuing operations and net income from continuing operations.
 Our Competitive Strengths
 As a leader in the fluid delivery industry, we believe that our key competitive strengths include the following:
 Deep Fluids Engineering Expertise
 We believe that our engineering team, comprised of chemical engineers, mechanical engineers and software and systems engineers, has positioned us to expand the scope of our solutions, provide innovative subsystems and strengthen our incumbent position at our OEM customers. Many of our engineers are industry veterans and have spent a significant portion of their careers at our customers, bringing first-hand expertise and a heightened understanding of our customers’ needs. Our engineering team acts as an extension of our customers’ product development teams, providing our customers with technical expertise that is outside of their core competencies.
Early Engagement with Customers on Product Development
 We seek to engage with our customers and potential customers very early in their process for new product development. We believe this approach enables us to collaborate on product design, qualification, manufacturing and testing in order to provide a comprehensive, customized solution. Through early engagement during the complex design stages, our engineering team gains early insight into our customers’ technology roadmaps which enables us to pioneer innovative and advanced solutions. In many cases our early engagement with our customers enables us to be the sole source supplier when the product is initially introduced.
Long History and Strong Relationships with Top Tier Customers
 We have established deep relationships with top tier OEMs such as Lam Research, Applied Materials, and ASML, which were our three largest customers by sales in 2018. Our customers are global leaders by sales in the semiconductor capital equipment industry. Our existing relationships with our customers have enabled us to effectively compete for new fluid delivery subsystems for our customers’ next generation products in development. We leverage our deep rooted existing customer relationships with these market leaders to penetrate new business opportunities created through industry consolidation. Our close collaboration with them has contributed to our established market position and several key supplier awards.

Operational Excellence with Scale to Support the Largest Customers
 Over our 19 year history of designing and building gas delivery systems, we have developed deep capabilities in operations. We have strategically located our manufacturing facilities near our customers’ locations in order to provide fast and efficient responses to new product introductions, and accommodate configuration or design changes late in the manufacturing process. We also added significant capacity in our Singapore facility to support high volume products and will continue to add capacity as needed to support future growth. In addition to providing high quality and reliable fluid delivery subsystems, one of our principal strategies is delivering the lead-times that provide our customers the required flexibility needed in their production processes. We have accomplished this by investing in manufacturing systems and processes and an efficient supply chain. Our focus on operational efficiency and flexibility allows us to reduce manufacturing cycle times in order to respond quickly to customer requests and lead-times that are often less than four weeks.
Capital Efficient and Scalable Business Model
 In general, our business is not capital intensive and we are able to grow sales with a low investment in property, plant and equipment. In 2018, 2017, and 2016, our total capital expenditures were $13.9 million, $8.2 million, and $4.3 million, respectively, representing only 1.7%, 1.3%, and 1.1% of sales, respectively. The semiconductor capital equipment market has historically been cyclical. We have structured our business to minimize fixed manufacturing overhead and operating expenses to enable us to grow net income at a higher rate than sales during periods of growth. Conversely, our low fixed cost approach allows us to minimize the impact of cyclical downturns on our net income, but results in a lower level of gross margin leverage or improvement as a percentage of sales in times of increased demand. For example, from 2014 to 2018, sales grew at a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 35% while adjusted net income from continuing operations grew at a CAGR of 64%. Conversely, our low fixed cost approach allows us to minimize the impact of cyclical downturns on our net income, but results in a smaller increase in gross margin as a percentage of sales in times of increased demand.
Our Growth Strategy
 Our objective is to enhance our position as a leader in providing fluid delivery solutions, including subsystems, components, and tool refurbishment, to our customers by leveraging our core strengths. The key elements of our growth strategy are:
Grow Our Market Share within Existing Customer Base
 We intend to grow our position within our existing customers by continuing to leverage our specialized engineering talent, early collaboration approach with OEMs to foster long-term relationships and expanded product offerings. Each of our customers produces many different process tools for various process steps. At each customer, we are an outsourced supplier of fluid delivery subsystems and components for a subset of their entire process tool offerings. We are constantly looking to expand our market share at our existing customers. We believe that our early collaborative approach with customers positions us to deliver innovative and dynamic solutions, offer timely deployment and meet competitive cost targets, further increasing our market share. Through our acquisitions of a weldment company and a precision machining company in July and December 2017, respectively, a plastic machining & fabrication company in April 2016, and a Korean gas panel supplier in April 2018, we expanded our served market and also entered the market for chemical delivery subsystems for wet process tools where we had only limited engagement in the past. Using this and our existing engineering capability, we developed a liquid delivery module and was qualified on a wet process equipment system at one of our largest customers who is a market leader in this space.
Grow Our Total Available Market at Existing Customers with Expanded Product Offerings
 We continue to work with our existing core customers on additional opportunities, including chemical delivery, one of our important potential growth areas. We believe that wet processes, clean and electro chemical deposition, or ECD, that require precise chemical delivery are currently an underpenetrated market opportunity for us. By leveraging our existing customer relationships and strong reputation in fluid mechanics, we intend to increase our chemical delivery module market share and introduce additional related products. Through our acquisitions of a weldment company and a precision machining company in July and December 2017, respectively, a plastic machining & fabrication company in April 2016, and a Korean gas panel supplier in April 2018, we expanded our served market and entered the market for chemical delivery subsystems. The acquisitions allow us to manufacture and assemble the complex plastic and metal products and precision machined components for the semiconductor equipment, aerospace, and general-industrial industries, as well as provide us exposure to and growth opportunities in the Korean semiconductor capital equipment market.

Expand Our Total Customer Base within Fluid Delivery Market
 We have expanded our customer base and are currently a supplier of gas delivery systems for a leading lithography system manufacturer, a leading ALD system manufacturer, and a Korean process tool OEM. We continue to actively engage with new customers that are considering outsourcing their gas and chemical delivery needs as well as expanding our components business.
Continue to Improve Our Manufacturing Process Efficiency
 We continually strive to improve our processes to reduce our manufacturing process cycle time, improve our ability to respond to short lead-time and last minute configuration changes, reduce our manufacturing costs, and improve our inventory efficiency requirements in order to improve profitability and make our product offerings more attractive to new and existing customers.
Our Products and Services
 We are a leader in the design, engineering and manufacturing of critical fluid delivery subsystems. Our product and service offerings are classified in the following categories:
Gas Delivery Subsystems
 Gas delivery is among the most technologically complex functions in semiconductor capital equipment and is used to deliver, monitor and control precise quantities of the vapors and gases critical to the manufacturing process. Our gas delivery systems consist of a number of gas lines, each controlled by a series of mass flow controllers, regulators, pressure transducers and valves, and an integrated electronic control system. Our gas delivery subsystems are primarily used in equipment for “dry” manufacturing processes, such as etch, chemical vapor deposition, physical vapor deposition, epitaxy and strip.

Chemical Delivery Subsystems
 Our chemical delivery subsystems are used to precisely blend and dispense reactive chemistries and colloidal slurries critical to the specific “wet” front-end process, such as wet clean, electro chemical deposition (“ECD”), and chemical-mechanical planarization (“CMP”). In addition to the chemical delivery subsystem, we also develop the process modules that apply the various chemicals directly to the wafer in a process and application-unique manner to create the desired chemical reaction.
 The image below shows a typical wet-process front end semiconductor tool, with a chemical delivery subsystem and corresponding application process module highlighted:
 

Weldments
 Our complete offering of weldments support the delivery of fluids through the process tool. We have developed both automated and manual welding process to support world class workmanship on all types of metals needed to support fluid delivery within the semiconductor market. The welded assemblies are used in both wet and dry processes.
Precision Machining
 Precision machining provides the ability to supply our customers with components used in our gas delivery systems and weldments, while also providing custom machined solutions throughout customers’ equipment. Many of these items are used downstream of the gas system and in process critical applications. Our precision machined products can be used in both wet and dry applications.

History
 We were originally incorporated as Celerity, Inc. (“Celerity”) in 1999. Our business of designing and manufacturing critical systems for semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers operated as a stand-alone business until 2009 when Celerity sold the business to a private equity fund. Francisco Partners (“FP”) acquired the business in December 2011 and formed Ichor Holdings, Ltd., an exempt company incorporated in the Cayman Islands, in March 2012 to serve as the parent company as part of a restructuring to accommodate the expansion of our business in Singapore and Malaysia. In April 2012, we acquired Semi Scenic UK Limited to provide refurbishment services for legacy tools. In April 2016, we purchased Ajax for $17.6 million to add chemical delivery subsystem capabilities with existing customers. We completed the initial public offering of our ordinary shares in December 2016. In July 2017 we acquired Cal‑Weld, Inc. (“Cal‑Weld”) for $56.2 million to add to our gas delivery subsystem and weldment capabilities. In December 2017 we acquired Talon Innovations Corporation (“Talon”) for $137.8 million to add to our gas delivery subsystem, precision machining, and component manufacturing capabilities. In April 2018, we acquired IAN Engineering Co., Ltd. (“IAN”) for $6.5 million to provide us exposure to and growth opportunities in the Korean semiconductor capital equipment market. We intend to continue to evaluate opportunistic acquisitions to supplement our organic growth.
Customers, Sales and Marketing
 We market and sell our products directly to equipment OEMs in the semiconductor equipment market. We are dependent upon a small number of customers, as the semiconductor equipment manufacturer market is highly concentrated with four companies accounting for over 80% of all process tool revenues. For 2018, our two largest customers were Lam Research and Applied Materials, which accounted for 56% and 32% of sales, respectively. We do not have long-term contracts that require customers to place orders with us in fixed or minimum volumes, and we generally operate on a purchase order basis with customers.
 Our sales and marketing efforts focus on fostering close business relationships with our customers. As a result, we locate many of our account managers near the customer they support. Our sales process involves close collaboration between our account managers and engineering and operations teams. Account managers and engineers work together with customers and in certain cases provide on-site support, including attending customers’ internal meetings related to production and engineering design. Each customer project is supported by our account managers and customer support team, who ensure we are aligned with all of the customer’s quality, cost and delivery expectations.
 Operations, Manufacturing and Supply Chain Management
 We have developed a highly flexible manufacturing model with cost-effective locations situated nearby the manufacturing facilities of our largest customers. We have facilities in the United States, Singapore, Malaysia, the United Kingdom, and Korea.
Operations
 Our product cycle engagements begin by working closely with our customers to outline the solution specifications before design and prototyping even begin. Our design and manufacturing process is highly flexible, enabling our customers to make alterations to their final requirements throughout the design, engineering and manufacturing process. This flexibility results in significantly decreased order-to-delivery cycle times for our customers. For instance, it can take as little as 20 to 30 days for us to manufacture a gas delivery system with fully evaluated performance metrics after receiving an order.
Manufacturing
 We are ISO 9001 certified or compliant at each of our manufacturing locations, and our manufactured subsystems and modules adhere to strict design tolerances and specifications. We operate Class 100 and Class 10,000 clean room facilities for customer-specified testing, assembly, and integration of high-purity gas and chemical delivery systems at our locations in Singapore, Oregon, Texas, and Korea. We operate additional facilities in Malaysia, Oregon, and California for weldments and related components used in our gas delivery subsystems, and we operate a separate facility in California for critical components used in our chemical delivery subsystems. We operate facilities in Minnesota and Florida for precision machining of components for sale to our customers and internal use. Our facilities are located in close proximity to our largest customers to allow us to collaborate with them on a regular basis and to enable us to deliver our products on a just-in-time basis, regardless of order size or the degree of changes in the applicable configuration or specifications.
 We qualify and test key components that are integrated into our subsystems, and test our fluid delivery subsystems during the design process and again prior to shipping. Our quality management system allows us to access real-time corrective action reports, non-conformance reports, customer complaints and controlled documentation. In addition, our senior management conducts quarterly reviews of our quality control system to evaluate effectiveness. Our customers also complete quarterly surveys which allow us to measure satisfaction.

Supply Chain Management
 We use a wide range of components and materials in the production of our gas and chemical delivery systems, including filters, mass flow controllers, regulators, pressure transducers and valves. We obtain components and materials from a large number or sources, including single source and sole source suppliers. We use consignment material and just-in-time stocking programs to better manage our component inventories and better respond to changing customer requirements. These approaches enable us to significantly reduce our inventory levels and maintain flexibility in responding to changes in product demand.
 In addition, a key part of our strategy is to identify multiple suppliers with a strong global reach that are located within close proximity to our manufacturing locations.
 Technology Development and Engineering
 We have a long history of engineering innovation and development. Over time, we have transitioned from being simply an integration engineering and components company into a gas and chemical delivery subsystem leader with complete system engineering and integration expertise. Our industry continues to experience rapid technological change, requiring us to continuously invest in technology and product development and to regularly introduce new products and features that meet our customers’ evolving requirements.
 We have built a team of fluid delivery experts. As of December 28, 2018, our engineering team consisted of approximately 75 engineers and designers with mechanical, electrical, chemical, systems and software expertise. Our engineers are closely connected with our customers and typically work at our customers’ sites and operate as an extension of our customers’ design team. We engineer within our customers’ processes, design vaults, drawing standards and part numbering systems. These development efforts are designed to meet specific customer requirements in the areas of subsystem design, materials, component selection and functionality. The majority of our sales are generated from projects during which our engineers cooperated with our customer early in the design cycle. Through this early collaborative process, we become an integral part of our customers’ design and development processes, and we are able to quickly anticipate and respond to our customers’ changing requirements.
 Our engineering team also works directly with our suppliers to help them identify new component technologies and make necessary changes in, and enhancements to, the components that we integrate into our products. Our analytical and testing capabilities enable us to evaluate multiple supplier component technologies and provide customers with a wide range of appropriate component and design choices for their gas and chemical delivery systems and other critical subsystems. Our analytical and testing capabilities also help us anticipate technological changes and the requirements in component features for next-generation gas delivery systems and other critical subsystems.
 Competition
 The markets for our products are very competitive. When we compete for new business, we face competition from other suppliers of gas or chemical delivery subsystems, and in some cases with the internal manufacturing groups of OEMs. While many OEMs have outsourced the design and manufacture of their gas and chemical delivery systems, we would face additional competition if in the future these OEMs elected to develop these systems internally.
 The fluid delivery subsystem market is concentrated and we face competition primarily from Ultra Clean Technology, with some competition from regional suppliers. The chemical delivery subsystem, weldment and precision machining industries are fragmented and we face competition from numerous smaller suppliers. In addition, the market for tool refurbishment is fragmented and we compete with many regional competitors. The primary competitive factors we emphasize include:
  
• | early engagement with customers;
--+---------------------------------


• | size and experience of engineering staff;
--+------------------------------------------


• | design-to-delivery cycle times;
--+--------------------------------


• | flexible manufacturing capabilities; and
--+-----------------------------------------


• | customer relationships.
--+------------------------

 We expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that could adversely affect sales of our current and future products. In addition, the limited number of potential customers in our industry further intensifies competition. We anticipate that increased competitive pressures may cause intensified price-based competition and we may have to reduce the prices of our products. In addition, we expect to face new competitors as we enter new markets.

Intellectual Property
 Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to maintain and protect our technology and products and to conduct our business without infringing the proprietary rights of others. We continue to invest in securing intellectual property protection for our technology and products and protect our technology by, among other things, filing patent applications. We also rely on a combination of trade secrets and confidentiality provisions, and to a much lesser extent, copyrights and trademarks, to protect our proprietary rights. We have historically focused our patent protection efforts in the United States. As of December 28, 2018, we held 47 patents, 19 of which were U.S. patents. While we consider our patents to be valuable assets, we do not believe the success of our business or our overall operations are dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents. In addition, we do not believe that the loss or expiration of any single patent or group of related patents would materially affect our business.
 Intellectual property that we develop on behalf of our customers is generally owned exclusively by those customers. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify certain of our customers against claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others with respect to our products. Historically, we have not paid any claims under these indemnification obligations, and we do not have any pending indemnification claims against us.
 Employees and Labor Relations
 As of December 28, 2018, we had approximately 1,305 full‑time employees and 185 contract or temporary workers, which allow flexibility as business conditions and geographic demand change. Of our total employees, approximately 75 are engineers, 60 are engaged in sales and marketing, 1,255 are engaged in manufacturing, and 100 perform executive and administrative functions. None of our employees are unionized, but in various countries, local law requires our participation in works councils. We have not experienced any material work stoppages at any of our facilities. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Environmental, Health, and Safety Regulations
 Our operations and facilities are subject to federal, state and local regulatory requirements and foreign laws and regulations, relating to environmental, waste management and health and safety matters, including those relating to the release, use, storage, treatment, transportation, discharge, disposal and remediation of contaminants, hazardous substances and wastes, as well as practices and procedures applicable to the construction and operation of our facilities. We believe that our business is operated in substantial compliance with applicable regulations. However, in the future we could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines or civil or criminal sanctions, or third-party property damage or personal injury claims, in the event of violations or liabilities under these laws and regulations, or non-compliance with the environmental permits required at our facilities. Potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with environmental laws that may be adopted or imposed in the future. We are not aware of any threatened or pending environmental investigations, lawsuits or claims involving us, our operations or our current or former facilities.
