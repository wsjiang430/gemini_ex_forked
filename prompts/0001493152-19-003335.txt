ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
BioTime is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing new cellular therapies for degenerative retinal diseases, neurological conditions associated with demyelination, and aiding the body in detecting and combating cancer. Our programs are based on our proprietary cell-based therapy platform and associated development and manufacturing capabilities. With our platform we develop and manufacture specialized, terminally-differentiated human cells from our pluripotent and progenitor cell starting materials. These differentiated cells are developed either to replace or support cells that are dysfunctional or absent due to degenerative disease or traumatic injury, or are administered as a means of helping the body mount an effective immune response to cancer.
Product Candidates & Other Programs
 
We have three cell therapy programs in clinical development:
 

● | OpRegen®, a retinal pigment epithelium cell replacement therapy currently in a Phase I/IIa multicenter clinical trial for the treatment of advanced dry age-related macular degeneration (“dry-AMD”) with geographic atrophy (“OpRegen trial”). Dry-AMD accounts for approximately 85-90% of all age-related macular degeneration cases and is the leading cause of blindness in people over the age of 60. There currently are no therapies approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for dry-AMD. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | OPC1, an oligodendrocyte progenitor cell therapy currently in a Phase I/IIa multicenter clinical trial for acute spinal cord injuries. This clinical trial has been partially funded by the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (“CIRM”). 
● | VAC2, an allogeneic (non-patient-specific or “off-the-shelf”) cancer immunotherapy of antigen-presenting dendritic cells currently in a Phase I clinical trial in non-small cell lung cancer. This clinical trial is being funded and conducted by Cancer Research UK, the world’s largest independent cancer research charity. 

 
We also have cell/drug delivery programs based upon our proprietary HyStem® cell and drug delivery matrix technology. HyStem was designed to support the formulation, transfer, retention, and engraftment of cellular therapies. We also established and support multiple collaborations with both academic and for-profit partners to develop HyStem for additional therapeutic uses, and we sell both research and GMP-grade HyStem to support additional external research and development activities.
 
Our lead cell delivery clinical program is Renevia®, a medical device developed as a replacement for whole adipose tissue in cell assisted lipotransfer (CAL) procedures, and which met its primary endpoint of change in hemifacial volume at 6 months in the treated patients compared to patients in the delayed treatment arm as measured by three-dimensional photographic volumetric assessment, in a European pivotal clinical trial in patients with HIV-associated facial lipoatrophy. In 2018, we submitted a design dossier for EU market clearance (CE Mark) for the use of Renevia as a device to aid in transferring a patient’s own adipose tissue to treat certain forms of facial lipoatrophy, or fat loss. We have ongoing discussions with our European notified body and are currently awaiting notification as to its status. We expect to receive a decision from the notified body in the second half of 2019.

Ownership in Other Companies
 
In addition to seeking to create value for shareholders by developing product candidates and other technologies through our clinical development programs, we also seek to create value from our technologies through partnering and strategic transactions. Two publicly-traded companies, OncoCyte Corporation (“OncoCyte”, NYSE American: OCX) and AgeX Therapeutics, Inc. (“AgeX”, NYSE American: AGE) were founded by BioTime in order to develop products from technologies invented within BioTime. Both companies subsequently raised capital and we distributed a portion of our shares in each company to our shareholders. A portion of AgeX common stock was also sold to Juvenescence Limited (“Juvenescence”) in exchange for $21.6 million of cash and a $21.6 million convertible promissory note.
 
Currently, our largest equity holding (approximately 28%) is in OncoCyte which we formed in 2015 to continue development of cancer diagnostic technology, and which is now focused on developing confirmatory diagnostic tests for lung cancer utilizing novel liquid biopsy technology. In late January 2019, OncoCyte announced successful results of its DetermaVu R&D validation study. Oncocyte announced in February 2019 that it had raised $40.25 million in gross proceeds in a public offering of its common stock. See “—Recent Transactions Affecting Our Corporate Organization,” below.
 
We also have a minority equity holding (approximately 4.8%) in AgeX Therapeutics, Inc., which we formed in 2017 to continue development of certain early-stage programs relating to cell immortality, regenerative biology, aging, and age-related diseases. AgeX had been our consolidated subsidiary until its deconsolidation August 30, 2018. See ““—Recent Transactions Affecting Our Corporate Organization,” below. AgeX’s initial programs focus on utilizing brown adipose tissue to target diabetes, obesity, and heart disease, and induced tissue regeneration technology utilizing the human body’s own abilities to scarlessly regenerate tissues damaged from age or trauma.
 
We also continue to hold the $21.6 million convertible promissory note issued by Juvenescence.
 
The combined value of these holdings as of March 13, 2019, was $85.5 million. The value of the Juvenescence note is based on the principal amount of $21.6 million plus accrued interest. The values of OncoCyte and AgeX are based on the closing price of their common stock on that date. See “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS—Risks Related to Our Business Operations and Capital Requirements—The value of our investments in other companies fluctuates based on their respective stock prices and could be negatively impacted by poor business performance,” below. Though our principal focus is on advancing our three cell therapy programs in clinical development, we may seek to create additional value through corporate transactions, as we have in the past. Our securities holdings also may be a significant source of capital to fund our operations as an alternative to issuing additional BioTime securities.

Recent Transactions Affecting Our Corporate Organization
 
Asterias Merger
 
On March 8, 2019, we acquired Asterias Biotherapeutics, Inc. (“Asterias”) via merger. In the acquisition, each outstanding share of Asterias common stock was converted into our common stock at an exchange ratio of 0.71 BioTime shares for each Asterias share.
 
Prior to May 13, 2016, Asterias was a majority-owned and consolidated subsidiary of BioTime. On May 13, 2016, BioTime’s percentage ownership decreased from 57.1% to 48.7% as a result of the sale of shares of common stock by Asterias in a public offering, resulting in BioTime’s loss of control of Asterias under generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”). Accordingly, BioTime deconsolidated Asterias effective May 13, 2016. From May 13, 2016 until the consummation of the merger on March 8, 2019, BioTime accounted for its ownership of Asterias under the equity method of accounting, electing the fair value option, with the investment carried on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value and all subsequent changes in fair value included in BioTime’s consolidated statements of operations in other income and expenses, net. The deconsolidation of Asterias is sometimes referred to as the “Asterias Deconsolidation” in this Report.
 
Audited financial statements of Asterias for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are included as financial statement schedules in Part IV, Item 15, and are filed as an exhibit to this Report.
 
AgeX Deconsolidation and Distribution
 
On August 30, 2018, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Juvenescence and AgeX, under which we sold 14,400,000 of our shares of AgeX common stock to Juvenescence for $3.00 per share. The transaction resulted in over $43 million in non-dilutive financing for BioTime.
 
Upon completion of that transaction, our percentage ownership of AgeX’s outstanding shares of common stock decreased from 80.4% to 40.2%, and Juvenescence’s percentage ownership increased from 5.6% to 45.8%. As a result of the transaction, as of August 30, 2018, AgeX was no longer our subsidiary and effective that date, we deconsolidated AgeX’s consolidated financial statements and consolidated results of operations from BioTime’s under GAAP due to the decrease in our percentage ownership in AgeX to below 50%. Prior to that date, AgeX was our majority-owned and consolidated subsidiary. Beginning on August 30, 2018 through November 28, 2018 (the date on which AgeX began trading as a public company as discussed below), we accounted for AgeX using the equity method of accounting, electing the fair value option, recording the retained interest in AgeX at fair value on August 30, 2018 with all subsequent changes in fair value included in our consolidated statements of operations in other income and expenses, net.
 
On November 28, 2018, AgeX began trading as a public company on the NYSE American (under the symbol “AGE”) and, on that date, we distributed 12.7 million shares of AgeX common stock we owned to our shareholders, on a pro rata basis, in the ratio of one share of AgeX common stock for every 10 shares of our common stock they owned. This distribution was accounted for at fair value as a taxable, dividend-in-kind transaction in the aggregate amount of $34.4 million. Immediately following the distribution, we owned 1.7 million shares of AgeX common stock, all of which we still own, and which represents approximately 4.8% of AgeX’s outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2018. We hold the shares of AgeX common stock that we own as marketable equity securities.

As of, and for each reporting period after August 30, 2018, the fair value of our ownership interest in AgeX will be determined by multiplying the fair value of a share of AgeX common stock by the number of such shares we own.
 
AgeX’s consolidated assets and liabilities are not included in our audited consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2018, due to the deconsolidation. The fair value of the AgeX shares we owned is shown on our audited consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018. Our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2017 includes AgeX’s consolidated assets and liabilities, after intercompany eliminations. Our audited consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 include AgeX’s consolidated results for the period through August 29, 2018, the day immediately preceding the deconsolidation. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our consolidated results include AgeX’s consolidated results.
 
The deconsolidation of AgeX is sometimes referred to as the “AgeX Deconsolidation” in this Report.
 
The distribution of AgeX common stock is sometimes referred to as the “AgeX Distribution” in this Report.
 
Audited consolidated financial statements of AgeX for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 will be included as financial statement schedules in Part IV, Item 15 and will be filed as an exhibit by an amendment to this Report.
 
OncoCyte Deconsolidation
 
Effective February 17, 2017, we deconsolidated the financial statements and results of operations of OncoCyte under GAAP due to the decrease in our percentage ownership in OncoCyte to below 50% as a result of OncoCyte’s issuance of 625,000 shares of its common stock upon exercise of warrants. Prior to that date, OncoCyte was our majority-owned and consolidated subsidiary. Since February 17, 2017, we have accounted for OncoCyte using the equity method of accounting, electing the fair value option, with all subsequent changes in fair value included in our consolidated statements of operations in other income and expenses, net. As of, and for each reporting period after February 17, 2017, the fair value of our ownership interest in OncoCyte has been determined by multiplying the closing price of OncoCyte common stock as quoted on NYSE American by the number of such shares we owned.
 
OncoCyte’s assets and liabilities are not included in our audited consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2017 due to the deconsolidation. The fair value of OncoCyte shares we owned is shown on our audited consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. Our audited consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 include OncoCyte’s results from January 1, 2017 through February 16, 2017, the day immediately preceding the deconsolidation. OncoCyte’s results are not included in our audited consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018.
 
The deconsolidation of OncoCyte is sometimes referred to as the “OncoCyte Deconsolidation” in this Report.
 
Audited financial statements of Onco Cyte for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 will be included as financial statement schedules in Part IV, Item 15 and will be filed as an exhibit by an amendment to this Report.

2018 and Early 2019 Highlights
 
We achieved numerous strategic accomplishments during 2018 and early 2019, including advancing clinical trials and product development in several key programs.
 

● | We presented encouraging data from the OpRegen trial in dry-AMD. Data from the ongoing open-label dose escalation trial was presented in May 2018 at the Annual Meeting of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) in Honolulu, Hawaii by Eyal Banin, MD, PhD. Data presented from the phase I/IIa open-label study showed that both the surgical procedure and the OpRegen cells were generally well tolerated, with no treatment-related systemic SAEs reported to date in the first nine patients. The Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) of these patients remained relatively stable. In addition, the imaging of patients 8 and 9 suggested early signs of structural improvement within the retina.

● | OpRegen trial in dry-AMD expanded. We expanded the OpRegen trial in dry-AMD in the U.S. with the opening of two additional sites in California; the Byers Eye Institute at the Stanford University School of Medicine and The Retinal Consultants Medical Group in Sacramento. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We completed enrollment of Cohort 3 in the OpRegen trial in dry-AMD and received Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) approval to move forward with better sighted patients in Cohort 4 (20/64 to 20/250 with smaller areas of GA) and treated the first 3 subjects. Having demonstrated that OpRegen was well tolerated in legally blind patients, we believe that moving to earlier stages of disease may be more likely to demonstrate evidence of clinical benefit as assessed by improved BCVA, reading speed, visual acuity in low luminance, and microperimetry. 
 | Supporting this hypothesis, the visual acuity of the first 3 Cohort 4 patients have all seen improvements from baseline levels, which will need to be followed for longer periods of time, and preliminary evidence of improved structural changes following treatment have been observed. 
● | In January 2019, we entered into a research and option agreement with Orbit Biomedical for the assessment of their 510k cleared Subretinal Delivery System in our ongoing OpRegen trial. The Orbit device is designed to precisely and consistently deliver therapeutics to the sub-retinal space via a suprachoroidal route, avoiding the need for a vitrectomy and perforation of the retina. We currently plan to introduce the Orbit device into our Phase I/IIa clinical study in the second quarter of 2019 and we intend to dose at least six patients with the device. 
● | In August 2018, we sold 50% of our equity position in AgeX for $43.2 million to Juvenescence. We received $21.6 million in cash and the remaining $21.6 million was paid in the form of a 2-year convertible promissory note with an annual interest rate of 7%, payable at maturity in August 2020. If Juvenescence conducts an initial public offering, the note is convertible into Juvenescence stock which includes an upward adjustment if the price of AGE is above $3.00 at the time of the Juvenescence public offering. 
● | In November 2018, AgeX began trading as a public company and we distributed 88% of our equity position in AgeX to our shareholders. Immediately following the distribution, we owned 1.7 million shares of AgeX common stock, all of which we still own, and which represents approximately 4.8% of AgeX’s outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2018 and which shares we hold as marketable equity securities. 
● | On March 8, 2019, we acquired Asterias. We entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Asterias on November 7, 2018 and closed the acquisition on March 8, 2019. As a result of this acquisition, we acquired several cell replacement product candidates and now have three in active clinical development: OpRegen, OPC1 and VAC2. We expect to achieve significant cost synergies as we complete the integration of Asterias into BioTime. 
● | In 2018, Cell Cure was awarded a grant of up to 6.9 million Israeli New Shekels (approximately $1.9 million) from the Israel Innovation Authority (IIA). The grant provides funding for the continued development of OpRegen, and to date the IIA has provided annual grants to Cell Cure totaling approximately $13 million. 
● | We established an innovative cell therapy manufacturing facility in the Bio Park on the campus of the Hadassah University Hospital in Jerusalem, Israel. The facility includes process development laboratories and an 800 square meter (8,600 square feet), state-of-the-art, cGMP manufacturing facility. It is designed and equipped to enable simultaneous GMP processes and to produce OpRegen and a range of cell therapy products for human use in clinical trials as well as at a scale suitable for commercial launch. 
● | During 2018, we were issued 17 new patents. These new patents add to the over 800 issued patents or pending patent applications we own or license worldwide and address many of our key programs. 

Business Strategy
 
Our goal is to become a leading cell therapy company developing differentiated pluripotent cells into specific cell types for use as whole cell treatments to restore diseased or diminished functions, such as impaired vision, loss of movement and sensation, or to increase immune response to tumors. Significant near-term activities that underlie our business strategy include:

● | Complete the integration of Asterias into BioTime. On March 8, 2019, we completed our acquisition of Asterias. Over the next few months, we plan to integrate clinical and manufacturing related activities surrounding OPC1 and VAC 2 into our business. We expect to significantly reduce the cash burn of the combined companies by eliminating redundant personnel and utilizing the expertise of existing staff at BioTime to advance the clinical development of OPC1 and VAC2.

● | Complete enrollment in the Phase I/IIa study of OpRegen. In January 2019, we announced an exclusive partnership with Orbit Biomedical to assess its vitrectomy-free subretinal injection device as a means of delivering OpRegen in our ongoing OpRegen Phase I/IIa clinical study. We are in the process of amending the clinical protocol for that study to incorporate the Orbit device alongside our new and more user-friendly thaw and inject (“TAI”) formulation into that study and intend to dose at least six of our remaining patients with the Orbit device. We expect to complete enrollment in the study by the end of 2019. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Advance clinical development of OPC1. In January 2019, Asterias announced 12-month data on 25 patients in its Phase I/IIa trial in SCI. These data were supportive of further clinical development of OPC1. During 2019, we plan to further analyze these results and meet with the FDA to discuss next steps in the clinical development of OPC1. 
● | Advance clinical development of VAC2. In coordination with Cancer Research UK, we will continue to advance the clinical development of VAC2 with additional patient exposures in a Phase 1 clinical trial in non-small cell lung cancer. 
● | Create value through our OncoCyte, AgeX, and Juvenescence assets. The combined market value of these assets was approximately $85.5 million as of March 13, 2019. We will continue to evaluate how and when some or all of these assets may be converted into cash or other forms of value in 2019. 

Cell Therapy Technology
 
We believe we are a leader in pluripotent cell asset development and lineage derivation protocols. Pluripotent cells, which are widely published as capable of becoming any human cell type, have potential applications in many areas of medicine with large unmet patient needs, including certain age-related degenerative diseases and degenerative conditions for which there presently are no cures. We currently are focused on developing pluripotent cells into three specific cell types: retinal pigment epithelial cells, oligodendritic progenitor cells and dendritic cells.
Pluripotent Stem Cells


Unlike pharmaceuticals that require a molecular target, cellular therapies are often aimed at regenerating or replacing affected cells and tissues and or improving bodily functions such as immune surveillance, and therefore, may have broader or more suitable applicability than many pharmaceutical products. Small molecules and biologic therapies that require systemic delivery into the body often have unexpected results, or side effects, that can limit their usefulness. Cell replacement is locally administered, so systemic side effects are usually not a primary concern in therapeutic development. The risk profile more closely resembles that of transplant medicine, focused more on whether the transplanted cells are rejected by the body and whether the cells function as expected. We currently are using our pluripotent stem cells as biological starting material from which we derive three separate and specific cell types, each of which are product candidates currently in clinical testing.

Cell Therapy Product Candidates
 

OpRegen
 
OpRegen is our lead ophthalmic product candidate (currently in a Phase I/IIa clinical trial) for the treatment of advanced dry-AMD (age-related macular degeneration) with geographic atrophy (GA). AMD is a gradual, progressive, deterioration of the macula, the small sensitive area in the center of the retina that provides clear, high definition central vision. AMD affects over 30 million people worldwide and approximately 1.6 million people are diagnosed annually in the U.S. It is the leading cause of vision loss in people over the age of 60 in the developed world. Once the atrophy involves the fovea (the center of the macula), patients lose their central vision, making facial recognition, reading and driving difficult or impossible, and potentially resulting in legal blindness. Its cause is unknown, but thought to be multifactorial (e.g. genetics, environmental influences, age). There are two forms of AMD, the dry form and the wet form. Dry-AMD typically advances slowly toward GA in which retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and photoreceptors deteriorate over time. RPE cells support and nourish the retina. Approximately 85-90% of AMD patients suffer from dry-AMD, for which there is no FDA-approved medical therapies. Dry-AMD may also lead to wet-AMD, a condition for which there are FDA-approved treatments, but these treatments but have not been approved for the treatment of dry-AMD. Physicians often recommend a healthy diet, exercise, and/or nutritional supplements for dry-AMD, but nutritional supplements have shown limited efficacy in delaying the onset of more progressive disease in longer-term studies.



We believe one of the most promising future therapies for dry-AMD is to replace the layer of damaged RPE cells. OpRegen is a cell replacement therapy derived from our pluripotent cell technology. Using a proprietary directed differentiation method, OpRegen is a formulation of animal-free RPE cells with high yield and purity that can be transplanted directly into the patient’s eye, where the patient’s own RPE cells are missing or dysfunctional. The OpRegen therapeutic approach is designed to replace damaged or lost RPE cells with the goal of slowing disease progression to preserve and/or restore visual function.

Preclinical studies in the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rat have shown that following a single subretinal injection, OpRegen as a suspension of cells rapidly organized into their natural monolayer structure and survived until the end of the study, which we believe is critical to the potential success of OpRegen in humans. Additionally, rats receiving OpRegen had objective evidence of improved optomotor tracking, indicating functional visual improvement compared to control animals.
 
OpRegen is intended to be an allogeneic, “off-the-shelf,” product provided to retinal surgeons in an “easy-to-use” form for transplantation. Unlike other investigational treatments for dry-AMD, and currently-marketed treatments for wet-AMD (Ranibizumab (Lucentis®) and Aflibercept (Eylea®)), that require multiple, frequent injections into the eye, we expect OpRegen would potentially be administered in a single procedure, or once every several years.
 
The patients in our ongoing Phase I/IIa clinical study are 50 years of age or older, whose dry-AMD has advanced to the GA stage, with absence of additional concomitant ocular disorders. The eye in which the disease has progressed the most is treated, while the other eye serves as a control. Following injection, the patients are followed for 12 months at specified intervals to evaluate the safety and tolerability of OpRegen.
 
Following the initial 12-month period, patients are evaluated at longer intervals for up to an additional five years following administration. A secondary objective of the clinical trial is to examine the ability of transplanted OpRegen to engraft, survive, and modulate disease progression in the patients. In addition to thorough characterization of visual function, several vision tests are used to quantify stabilization or improvements in visual function. We also perform anatomical evaluation imaging to assess the restoration of the structure of the retina.
 
Interim data from the first 12 subjects in Cohorts 1-3 of our ongoing Phase I/IIa clinical study have been encouraging and suggest that OpRegen RPE cells are generally well-tolerated when administered by subretinal injection in these legally blind patients with large areas of GA that have encompassed the foveal area. The surgical procedures were generally well-tolerated, with spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images showing absorption of the subretinal fluid in the bleb less than 48 hours after surgery and healing of the site of retinal penetration by the cannula within a few weeks. Initial findings using a variety of imaging modalities suggest presence of cells in the subretinal space, an observation consistent with, and supported by, the data from preclinical studies of OpRegen. Findings on clinical examination by different imaging modalities show potential improvements in retinal structure, which could precede visual functional improvements. Though it is not definitively known at this time whether these changes represent engraftment and survival of the transplanted cells, data from the preclinical animal studies suggest this is the most likely scenario. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) has remained relatively stable in both the treated and non-treated eyes of these advanced AMD patients over the course of the study to date.
 
Importantly, in this safety-focused study, no unexpected ocular adverse events (AEs) have been observed and those events expected to occur based on the procedures involved in OpRegen administration, such as vitrectomy, have been mild in severity. The majority of these subjects had pre-existing epiretinal membranes (ERMs) at the time of study enrollment and several have experienced new or worsening ERM following the surgical procedure and OpRegen injection and these subjects are being monitored during study follow-up. One instance of retinal detachment occurred in a patient who was legally blind prior to treatment. The event was not assigned as related to treatment, procedure, or to the combination. The patient continued in the study following successful surgical repair. The independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) approved moving to the fourth cohort based on the safety data from the first three cohorts. Cohort 4 incorporates an additional variety of objective and subjective assessments to look for signs of potential efficacy as well as potential anatomical changes indicative of OpRegen cell function following implantation.

Many of the AEs observed in subretinal procedures are related to the delivery technique utilized during the surgery. In January 2019, we announced an exclusive partnership with Orbit Biomedical to assess their FDA-cleared Orbit Subretinal Delivery System, a vitrectomy-free delivery device for administration of OpRegen within the ongoing clinical study. The device allows for access to the subretinal space via a suprachoroidal approach without creating a hole in the retina and compromising its structural integrity. We believe that the use of this device could significantly decrease the number of AEs and improve dose control of cells in our clinical trials.
 
We completed enrollment in the first three cohorts of the trial (twelve patients) in the middle of 2018. We began enrollment of Cohort 4 shortly thereafter and have treated three patients to date. We are in the process of amending our clinical protocol to incorporate the Orbit device and our new thaw and inject (TAI) formulation into our Phase I/IIa clinical trial, and we intend to dose at least six patients with the Orbit device. We plan to enroll additional subjects for Cohort 4 at three currently participating sites in the United States. These sites are: Retina-Vitreous Associates in Los Angeles, Retinal Consultants Medical Group in Sacramento and West Coast Retina Medical Group in San Francisco.
 
We have established an innovative cell therapy manufacturing facility in the Jerusalem Bio Park on the campus of Hadassah University Hospital in Jerusalem, Israel. Our facility is equipped to produce cGMP-grade OpRegen and a range of other cell therapy products for human use in clinical trials as well as at a scale suitable for commercial introduction.
 
OPC1
 
OPC1 is our lead product candidate for the treatment of acute spinal cord injury (“SCI”). SCI occurs when the spinal cord is subjected to a severe crush or contusion injury, such as that caused by a car or motorcycle accident and typically results in severe functional impairment, including limb paralysis, aberrant pain signaling, and loss of bladder and sexual function. There are approximately 18,000 new spinal cord injuries annually in the U.S. (NSCIC SCI Facts and Figures at a Glance (2019)), and there are currently no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of SCI, although methylprednisolone, a corticosteroid generally used as an anti-inflammatory drug, is sometimes prescribed on an off-label basis to reduce acute inflammation in the injured spinal cord immediately after injury. It is believed that to effect substantial benefit in treating this complex injury, multiple mechanisms of action are required, such as introduction of biologics that preserve surviving neurons and stimulate new nerve axon outgrowth, suppression of lesion formation at the injury site, generation of new blood vessels to repair the ischemic damage from injury, and myelination of the demyelinated and newly formed nerve axons. A key therapeutic target in SCI is replacement of oligodendrocytes that are selectively lost at the injury site. As the sole source of the insulating protein myelin in the brain and spinal cord, oligodendrocytes wrap around nerve axons and allow conduction of electrical impulses throughout the central nervous system (“CNS”). Just as the gain of cognitive and motor functions early in life reflects the progression of connectivity and myelination within the developing CNS, the functional impairments that can occur after a traumatic injury such as SCI are a direct result of severed connections and demyelination.
 
OPC1 is an oligodendrocyte progenitor cell therapy derived from our pluripotent cell technology under Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) conditions using a directed differentiation method. These cells are stored frozen until ready for use as direct administration into the injured spinal cord. Based on preclinical studies, when OPC1 is transplanted into the injured spinal cord, the cells undergo further maturation to generate a replacement population of oligodendrocytes at the injury site that are capable of remyelinating denuded and newly formed nerve axons. Prior to their maturation, the transplanted oligodendrocyte progenitor cells stimulate additional reparative processes, including promotion of neuron survival and nerve axon outgrowth, and induction of blood vessel formation in and around the injury site. In addition, OPC1 cells rapidly migrate from the injection point to the injury site where they generate a supportive tissue matrix and suppress the formation of a lesion cavity. Based on the multiple reparative properties associated with OPC1, we believe this candidate cell therapy product is ideally suited to treat neurological conditions such as SCI and other demyelination and demyelination disorders of the CNS.
 
Under a grant for clinical development, the development of OPC1 has been supported by $14.3 million in funds from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (“CIRM”) from 2014 to date. We intend to apply for additional grants from CIRM for the program’s continued development.
 
OPC1 has been tested in two clinical trials to date: a five patient Phase I safety trial and a 25 patient Phase I/IIa dose escalation trial (the “SCiStar trial”). The SCiStar trial was conducted at 9 sites in the United States.
 
In January 2019, Asterias (our now wholly owned subsidiary) announced the following 12-month data from the SCiStar trial:
 

● | Positive Safety Profile - MRI scans at 12 months post-injection of OPC1 showed no evidence of adverse changes in any of the 25 SCiStar subjects treated with OPC1. Subjects were followed for as long as eight years. To date, there have been no unexpected serious adverse events (SAEs) related to the OPC1 cells. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Cell Engraftment - All three SCiStar subjects in Cohort 1 and 95% (21/22) of SCiStar subjects in Cohorts 2 through 5 have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans at 12 months consistent with the formation of a tissue matrix at the injury site, which is encouraging evidence that OPC1 cells engrafted at the injury site and helped to prevent cavitation. Clinically, cavitation is a destructive process that occurs within the spinal cord following spinal cord injuries, and typically results in permanent loss of motor and sensory function. A patient with cavitation can develop a condition known as syringomyelia, which results in additional neurological and functional damage and often results in chronic pain.

● | Improved Motor Function - At 12 months, 95% (21/22) of SCiStar study subjects who were administered either 10 million or 20 million cells of OPC1 (Cohorts 2 through 5) recovered at least one motor level on at least one side. At 12 months, 32% (7/22) of these subjects recovered two or more motor levels on at least one side. At 12 months, the average improvement in upper extremity motor score for these subjects was 8.9 points as measured by the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI) scale. No subjects saw decreased motor function following administration of OPC1 and subjects consistently retained the motor function recovery seen through 6 months or saw further motor function recovery from 6 to 12 months.

● | Results Excluding Certain SCiStar Study Subjects - Excluding those SCiStar subjects in Cohorts 2 through 5 that either (i) would not meet the eligibility criteria Asterias proposed to the FDA during its Type B meeting to discuss the next study for OPC1 or (ii) did not receive a modified post-surgical procedure to reduce potential cord compression issues, at 12 months 100% (17/17) of the SCiStar study subjects recovered at least one motor level on at least one side, 41% (7/17) of these subjects recovered two or more motor levels on at least one side, and the average improvement in upper extremity motor score as measured by the ISNCSCI scale for these subjects was 10.2 points. 

 
The FDA designated OPC1 as a Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (“RMAT”) for the treatment of acute SCI and granted it Orphan Drug Designation, which includes the ability for increased interfacing with the FDA during clinical development.
 
We intend to transfer all cGMP manufacturing processes, including the establishment of H1 cell banks and the OPC1 process development and manufacturing for clinical studies, to our cell therapy manufacturing facility in Jerusalem, Israel where OpRegen process development and production are currently ongoing.
 
Asterias management had a Type B meeting with the FDA to discuss the next clinical trial of OPC1. We are now analyzing the data from the SCiStar trial to inform us as to how to proceed with further discussions with the FDA. Additionally, we are leveraging our manufacturing capabilities and process development expertise learned from OpRegen to support OPC1’s development.
 
Because OPC1 has been shown to promote CNS repair through multiple reparative mechanisms, we believe its therapeutic benefit extends beyond SCI to other types of neurological injury and disease, particularly those that involve demyelination. Through ongoing collaborations with academic researchers, OPC1 is currently in preclinical development as treatment for both ischemic stroke and multiple sclerosis, two additional neurological conditions with demyelination as a key component of their pathology. In both cases, the preclinical data generated thus far has provided initial proof of concept efficacy of OPC1, which we intend to use to seek funding for consideration of further preclinical development.
 
VAC2
 
VAC2 is our lead product candidate for the treatment of cancer. Cancer afflicts millions worldwide and is one the largest unmet clinical needs with current treatment options providing limited efficacy and a wide range of debilitating side effects. To provide a more effective and targeted treatment, we are developing VAC2 as an allogeneic, or non-patient specific, cancer vaccine candidate designed to stimulate patient immune responses to telomerase which is commonly expressed in cancerous cells but not in normal adult cells. VAC2, which is produced from our pluripotent cell technology using a directed differentiation method, is comprised of a population of mature dendritic cells. As the most potent type of antigen presenting cell in the body, dendritic cells instruct our body’s immune system to attack and eliminate harmful pathogens and unwanted cells. To target cancerous cells, VAC2 is engineered to express the tumor-selective antigen telomerase, which is found in over 85% of all cancers. Because the tumor antigen is loaded exogenously into the dendritic cells prior to administration, VAC2 is a platform technology that can be modified to carry any antigen, including patient-specific tumor neo-antigens. Using pluripotent cells as the starting material for VAC2 production adds several additional advantages to this candidate therapeutic. Compared to technologies that rely on the use of a patient’s own blood, our pluripotent cell technology provides a scalable system for production of a large number of vaccine doses in a single lot, lower manufacturing costs, greater product consistency, and off-the-shelf availability to provide broader access to patients. In addition, we believe that as an allogeneic therapy, VAC2 has the potential to stimulate a more robust immune response through an adjuvant effect resulting from the partial immune mismatch between the VAC2 cells and patients receiving the therapy.
 
In September 2014, Asterias initiated clinical development of VAC2 by entering into a Clinical Trial and Option Agreement (the “CRUK Agreement”) with Cancer Research UK (“CRUK”) and Cancer Research Technology Limited (“CRT”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of CRUK, under which CRUK agreed to fund Phase I clinical development of VAC2 in non-small cell lung cancer. CRUK is responsible, at its own cost, for manufacturing clinical grade VAC2 and for carrying out the Phase I clinical trial of VAC2. Patient enrollment began in June 2018 and four patients have been enrolled to date.

Upon completion of the Phase I clinical trial, we will have an exclusive option to acquire the data generated in the trial and conduct further development of VAC2. The reacquisition fee is approximately $1.6 million with additional milestone fees based upon initiation of a Phase III study and the filing for regulatory approval, as well as mid-single-digit royalty payments on sales of commercial products. If BioTime declines this option, CRUK will then have an option to obtain a license to BioTime’s intellectual property to continue the development and commercialization of VAC2 and related products in exchange to BioTime for a revenue share of development and partnering proceeds. In connection with the CRUK Agreement, we sublicensed to CRUK for use in the clinical trials and product manufacturing process certain patents we licensed or sublicensed to third parties. We will also be obligated to pay to those licensors and sublicensors upon the achievement of various milestones and to pay royalties on sales of products if VAC2 is successfully developed and commercialized.
 
The allogenic VAC2 program was preceded by the autologous VAC1 program which isolated dendritic cells from a patient’s own blood, modified those cells to stimulate immune responses to telomerase and then administered those cells back to the patient as a therapeutic modality. VAC1 was studied for the treatment of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (“AML”), the most common form of acute leukemia in adults. A Phase II clinical trial of VAC1 demonstrated that it successfully manufactured and released in 24 out of the 33 patients enrolled in the study. Twenty-one patients received VAC1 in the study, including 19 in clinical remission and two in early relapse. VAC1 was found to have a favorable safety and tolerability profile. Asterias performed follow-up data collection on the 19 patients treated while in complete remission to determine the long-term effects of the VAC1 administration on remission duration and disease-free survival.
 
VAC1 utilized an autologous approach where the cellular vaccine needs to be created specifically for each patient. This results in a longer time to administer the therapy as compared to the allogeneic approach of the VAC2 program which is disadvantageous in advanced cancer patients given the rapidity of disease progression. The VAC1 program serves as an effective and encouraging proof of concept behind our approach to dendritic cell vaccines targeting telomerase, which is the backbone of the VAC2 program.
 
Cell/Drug Delivery Technology - HyStem®
 
HyStem is a patented biomaterial which mimics naturally occurring extracellular matrix, the structural network of molecules surrounding cells in organs and tissues essential to cellular function and tissue structure. Many tissue engineering and regenerative cell-based therapies will require the delivery of therapeutic cells in a matrix or scaffold for accurate anatomical placement, cell retention, and engraftment. HyStem is a unique hydrogel that has been shown to support cellular attachment and survival. Current research at leading medical institutions has shown that HyStem is compatible with a wide variety of cells and tissue types including brain, bone, skin, cartilage, vascular and heart tissues.
 
The patented technology underlying our HyStem hydrogel products in development, such as Renevia, was developed at the University of Utah and has been exclusively licensed to us for human therapeutic uses. The HyStem technology is based on a unique thiol cross-linking chemistry to prepare hyaluronan-based hydrogels. Since the first published report in 2002, there have been over 200 academic scientific publications supporting the biocompatibility of thiol cross-linked hyaluronan-based hydrogels and their applications as medical devices and in cell culture, tissue engineering, and animal models of cell-based therapies.
 
Due to the unique cross-linking chemistry, HyStem hydrogels have the ability to be formulated with cells and can be injected or applied as a gel, allowing it to conform to a cavity or space. This property offers several distinct advantages over other hydrogels, including the possibility of combining bioactive materials with the hydrogel at the point of use.
 
Renevia®
 
Renevia, our lead facial aesthetics product candidate, is being developed as a potential treatment for facial lipoatrophy. Lipoatrophy is the loss of fat tissue and may be caused by several factors, including trauma, aging or drug side effects, such as those that can occur from certain drugs used to treat patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Renevia consists of our HyStem hydrogel combined with the patient’s own fat or adipose progenitor cells. As a potential alternative to traditional fat transfer procedures, Renevia is designed to mimic the naturally-occurring extracellular matrix in the body and to provide a 3-D scaffold that supports effective cell transplant, retention, engraftment and metabolic support. Renevia is being developed with the goal of providing a natural looking and feeling, long-lasting option for facial volume restoration.
 
In 2017, Renevia met the primary endpoint of implanted volume retention in a pivotal clinical trial in Europe to assess its safety and effectiveness in restoring facial volume in patients whose subcutaneous fat, or adipose tissue, has been lost due to a side effect of certain drugs used to treat patients with HIV. In this clinical trial, Renevia treated patients retained approximately 100% of transplanted volume at six months (p<0.001), based on 3-D volume measurement of the implanted area, achieving the primary endpoint of the study. In addition to achieving the primary endpoint, treated patients retained an average 70% of the transplanted volume at 12 months and those patients that were observed after 18 months retained 64% of the transplanted volume. Based on these clinical trial results, in March 2018 we filed for marketing authorization in the European Union (EU) for certain forms of facial lipoatrophy. We anticipate feedback from the regulatory agency in the second half of 2019. If approved, we will seek to identify an external partner for commercialization of Renevia in Europe.

Research Programs
 
Vision restoration
 
In 2017, we expanded our ophthalmology portfolio by acquiring exclusive global rights to technology that allows the generation of three-dimensional human retinal tissue derived from human pluripotent cells. This tissue contains all the cell types and layers of the human retina and has shown evidence of functional integration in proof of concept animal models for advanced retinal degeneration. The technology is being developed to potentially treat or prevent a variety of retinal degenerative diseases and injuries. In 2017, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) awarded us a grant of up to $1.56 million to further develop this innovative, next generation vision restoration program for retinal diseases and injuries, which severely impact the quality of life for millions of people who have limited treatment options.
Demyelination
 
OPC1 exhibits multiple reparative properties that have broad applicability to neurological injury and disease, particularly as a treatment for demyelination. Current research efforts are focused on the development of OPC1 as a candidate treatment for ischemic stroke and multiple sclerosis (“MS”), two severely debilitating conditions that: 1) afflict a large number of individuals (approximately 692,000 stroke cases and 10,000 new MS cases per year in the U.S. (www.cdc.gov/stroke, www.nationalmssociety.org)), 2) lack any form of reparative treatment options, and 3) for which demyelination is a central component to their pathology.
 
To develop OPC1 as a treatment for MS, initial proof-of-concept efficacy data has been demonstrated in collaboration with Yale University using a non-human primate model of MS. Results of this study showed OPC1 engraftment that was associated with substantial remyelination of the lesioned primate spinal cord up to 5 months post-treatment. These data are in preparation for scientific publication. Subsequently, we initiated a collaboration with University of California Irvine to assess OPC1 efficacy in additional mouse models of MS that better recapitulate the autoimmune components of the disease. Preliminary results indicate that in addition to OPC1’s capacity to remyelinate the lesioned spinal cord, the cells may also help stimulate proliferation of a distinct class of immune cells known as regulatory T cells that can help reduce or eliminate autoimmunity. We intend to use the anticipated in vivo efficacy data obtained from the collaboration to seek additional non-dilutive funding for further development of OPC1 as a treatment for MS.
 
For ischemic stroke, initial proof-of-concept efficacy data for OPC1 has been demonstrated in a collaborative study with the University of California Los Angeles using a mouse model of white matter ischemic stroke. Results of this study demonstrated that within the stroke injury site, OPC1 cells engrafted, reduced lesion formation and inflammation, and increased myelination, culminating in improved functional recovery. We have since initiated a second preclinical study in collaboration with the University of South Florida to test two different doses of OPC1 in a rat model of ischemic subcortical and white matter stroke. We expect this study to be completed in the second quarter of 2019. We intend to use the results of these combined studies to seek additional funding and guide further preclinical development of OPC1 as a treatment for ischemic stroke.
 
Products for Orthopedic Indications
 
We also have research programs targeted at orthopedic indications. ReGlyde™ is another HyStem product in preclinical development as a device for viscosupplementation and as a platform for intraarticular drug delivery in osteoarthritis (OA). The viscosupplementation device program aims to administer ReGlyde directly into OA affected joints to provide joint lubrication to reduce pain and improve quality of life. The drug delivery program seeks to enable the sustained release of therapeutics in affected OA joints to help slow or reverse disease progression, in addition to alleviating pain and improving joint function.
 
These orthopedic programs are currently being conducted by OrthoCyte Corporation, an entity of which we own 99.8% of its outstanding capital stock.

PATENTS AND TRADE SECRETS
 
We rely primarily on patents and contractual obligations with employees and third parties to protect our proprietary rights. We have sought, and intend to continue to seek, appropriate patent protection for important and strategic components of our proprietary technologies by filing patent applications in the U.S. and certain foreign countries. There are no assurances that any of our intellectual property rights will guarantee protection or market exclusivity for our products and product candidates. We also use license agreements both to access technologies developed by other companies and universities and to convey certain intellectual property rights to others. Our financial success will be dependent, in part, on our ability to obtain commercially valuable patent claims, to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, and to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others if we are unable to obtain enabling licenses.
 
As of February 28, 2019, we owned or controlled or licensed directly or through our subsidiaries approximately 850 patents and pending patent applications worldwide including more than 190 issued or pending U.S. patents or patent applications. This number also includes the over 135 patents and applications licensed from WARF.
 
OpRegen
 
We and our subsidiary, Cell Cure, have issued patents that will provide protection to OpRegen. The issued patents have expiry dates ranging from 2025 to 2033. We and our subsidiary, Cell Cure also have pending applications that if issued, will provide protection to OpRegen and will have expiry dates ranging from December 2025 to December 2038.
 
Cell Cure was a party to two pending opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office (EPO) involving EP Patent Numbers 2147094 (issued 08-Oct-2014) and 2554661 (issued 19-Nov-2014), both entitled, “Stem Cell-Derived Retinal Pigment Epithelial Cells”. The Oral Proceedings took place on March 16, 2017 and March 17, 2017, respectively. Both patents were upheld by the EPO. The decisions were both appealed and the detailed grounds for appeal were due on September 9, 2017 and September 11, 2017, respectively, however, both appeals were withdrawn prior to those dates and the patents will be issued as amended in the opposition proceedings. Both patents relate to our OpRegen product and provide protection until April 2028. There are additional patent applications pending that if issued will provide further protection for OpRegen.

We have patent protection for Renevia with expiry dates ranging from May 2023 to August 2027, and pending applications that if issued, will provide protection to Renevia with expiry dates ranging from December 2024 to June 2038.
 
OPC1
 
The patent rights relevant to neural cells, such as oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, include various patent families acquired from Geron that are directed to the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (including hES cells) into various neural cell types, as well as various culture and purification methods. These patent rights also include rights licensed from the Regents of the University of California. There are issued patents in the United States, Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan, China, Hong Kong, India, Korea, Singapore and Israel. Additionally, there are five new pending patent families owned by us directed to improved methods of producing oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, oligodendrocyte progenitor cell compositions and methods of treatment of spinal cord injury and stroke using oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. The stroke family is jointly owned with the Regents of the University of California; the other four new pending families are solely owned by Asterias. The expiration dates of the patents acquired from Geron and in-licensed from the Regents of the University of California will be within 2021 to 2030. The potential expiry dates of the four new patent families with applications pending will be within 2036 to 2038. The commercial success of OPC1 product depends, in part, upon our ability to exclude competition for this product with the existing patent portfolio, regulatory exclusivity, or a combination of both.
 
VAC1 and VAC2
 
The patent rights relevant to dendritic cells include various patent families acquired from Geron or in-licensed from third parties that are directed to the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (including hES cells) into hematopoietic progenitor cells and immature and mature dendritic cells. In addition, these patent rights include a patent family with claims directed to immunogenic compositions comprising antigen-presenting dendritic cells and methods of eliciting an anti-telomerase immune response in a subject by administering to the subject such compositions. There are issued patents in the United States, Australia, Europe, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Israel and Singapore. The expiration dates of the patents acquired from Geron and in-licensed to us range from 2019 to 2029. Additionally, there is a new pending patent family owned by us with claims directed to immunotherapeutic compositions comprising immunogenic peptides and methods of eliciting a cellular mediated immune response in a subject, with a provisional patent application filed in 2017. The potential expiry date of the new patent family with a pending provisional application will be in 2038. The commercial success of VAC1 and VAC2 products depends, in part, upon our ability to exclude competition in these products with this patent portfolio, regulatory exclusivity, or a combination of both.
 
In addition, we have issued patents in the Unites States and various other jurisdictions for producing cardiomyocytes, pancreatic islet cells, hepatocytes, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts. The expiration dates of these patents range from 2020 to 2032.
 
General Risks Related to Obtaining and Enforcing Patent Protection
 
There is a risk that any patent applications that we file and any patents that we hold or later obtain could be challenged by third parties and be declared invalid or infringing on third party claims. Litigation, interferences, oppositions, inter partes reviews or other proceedings are, have been and may in the future be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain of our proprietary rights, and in other instances to determine the validity, scope or non-infringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our products. We may also face challenges to our patent and regulatory protections covering our products by third parties, including manufacturers of generics and biosimilars that may choose to launch or attempt to launch their products before the expiration of our patent or regulatory exclusivity. Litigation, interference, oppositions, inter partes reviews, administrative challenges or other similar types of proceedings are unpredictable and may be protracted, expensive and distracting to management. The outcome of such proceedings could adversely affect the validity and scope of our patent or other proprietary rights, hinder our ability to manufacture and market our products, require us to seek a license for the infringed product or technology or result in the assessment of significant monetary damages against us that may exceed any amounts that we may accrue on our financial statements as a reserve for contingent liabilities. An adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or a failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products. Furthermore, payments under any licenses that we are able to obtain would reduce our profits derived from the covered products and services.
 
The enforcement of patent rights often requires litigation against third-party infringers, and such litigation can be costly to pursue. Even if we succeed in having new patents issued or in defending any challenge to issued patents, there is no assurance that our patents will be comprehensive enough to provide us with meaningful patent protection against our competitors.

In addition to relying on patents, we rely on trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological advancement to maintain our competitive position. We have entered into intellectual property, invention, and non-disclosure agreements with our employees, and it is our practice to enter into confidentiality agreements with our consultants. There can be no assurance, however, that these measures will prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our trade secrets and know-how, or that others may not independently develop similar trade secrets and know-how or obtain access to our trade secrets, know-how, or proprietary technology.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 79 employees, of which 36 are BioTime employees and 43 are employees of our subsidiaries, including foreign subsidiaries, and of which 76 are employed on a full-time basis and three are employed on a part-time basis. 17 full-time employees hold Ph.D. degrees in one or more fields of science. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. In connection with our updated corporate objectives with a greater focus on clinical development, we reduced our worldwide headcount by 16 employees through employee terminations and the closing of vacant positions since December 31, 2017.
MANUFACTURING
 
Cell Products
 
We established an innovative cell therapy manufacturing facility in the Bio Park on the campus of the Hadassah University Hospital in Jerusalem, Israel. The facility includes process development laboratories and a state-of-the-art, cGMP manufacturing facility. It is designed and equipped to enable simultaneous GMP processes and to produce OpRegen and a range of cell therapy products for human use in clinical trials as well as at a scale suitable for commercial launch. We intend to transfer all cGMP manufacturing processes, including the establishment of H1 cell banks and the OPC1 process development and manufacturing for clinical studies, to this facility.
HyStem Hydrogel Products
 
We hold a California Device Manufacturing License and are registered with the FDA as a Device Manufacturer in support of our 510K cleared product, Premvia. We have ISO 13485:2003 certification for the design, development, manufacture, and distribution of hydrogels for therapeutic delivery applications. Although we hold these certifications, licenses, and registrations, all our HyStem® Hydrogel product manufacturing occurs at contract facilities located in Pennsylvania and California. Our contractors have the necessary registrations and certifications to perform this manufacturing.
Plasma Volume Expanders
 
BioTime has licensed Hextend rights to Hospira, Inc., a subsidiary of Pfizer, Inc., for the United States and to CJ Healthcare for South Korea. CJ Healthcare manufactures, markets and distributes our synthetic blood volume expander solution Hextend for use in the respective geographies. We receive royalties on the sales of Hextend.
RAW MATERIALS
 
Except as described below, we believe the raw materials and supplies that we require to manufacture our products, as well as the raw materials that we require for our research and development operations relating to our product candidates and products, are widely available from numerous suppliers and are generally considered to be generic materials and supplies. Except as described below, we do not rely on a single supplier for the current production of any product in development or for our research and development operations relating to our products.
 
We usually contract with suppliers to purchase the materials required for the research and development operations of our products. All the materials required in the research and development operations of our products are off-the-shelf pharmaceutical products; special production or special requirements are not required to order these materials. We have no written agreements with most of our suppliers. Rather, we submit purchase orders to our suppliers from time to time and as required.
 
Most of the ingredients in the HyStem products we are developing are readily obtainable from multiple sources. Two critical ingredients, gelatin and sodium hyaluronate, are readily available from multiple sources but would require significant testing in order to qualify new vendors as sources of those ingredients for our products.
 
LICENSED TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS
 
BioTime has obtained the right to use technology that we believe has great potential in our product development efforts, and that may be useful to other companies that are engaged in the research and development of products for human therapeutic and diagnostic use.

HyStem Hydrogel Technology
 
In February 2006, we acquired an exclusive worldwide license from the University of Utah to use certain patents in the production and sale of hydrogel products, including our HyStem products, excluding certain veterinary and animal health uses. Our licensed field of use includes, but is not limited to, all human pharmaceutical and medical device applications, all tissue engineering and regenerative medicine uses, and all research applications.
 
Under the license agreement, we will pay a 3% royalty on sales of products and services performed that utilize the licensed patents. We are obligated to pay minimum royalties to the extent that actual royalties on products sales and services utilizing the patents are less than the minimum royalty amount. The minimum royalty amounts are $30,000 per annum during the term of the license agreement. We will also pay the University of Utah 30% of any sublicense fees or royalties received under any sublicense of the licensed patents.
 
We will also pay a $225,000 milestone fee within six months after the first sale of a “tissue engineered product” that utilizes a licensed patent. A tissue engineered product is defined as living human tissues or cells on a polymer platform, created at a place other than the point-of-care facility, for transplantation into a human patient.
 
We agreed to pay an additional license fee for the additional rights licensed to us during August 2012, and the costs of filing, prosecuting, enforcing and maintaining the patents exclusively licensed to us, and a portion of those costs for patents that have been licensed to a third party for a different field of use.
 
We may, under certain circumstances, be obligated to sublicense to one or more third parties, on commercially reasonable terms to be negotiated between us and each prospective sublicensee, or re-grant to the University of Utah, rights to use the licensed patents for products and services outside the general industry in which we or any of our affiliates or sublicensees is then developing or commercializing, or has plans to develop or commercialize, a product using the licensed technology.
 
Hadasit Research and License Agreement
 
In June 2017, Cell Cure entered into a Second Amended and Restated License Agreement (the “Hadasit License Agreement”) with Hadasit Medical Research Services and Development Ltd. (“Hadasit”), the commercial arm and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hadassah Medical Organization. Pursuant to the Hadasit License Agreement, Hadasit granted Cell Cure an exclusive, worldwide, royalty bearing license (with the right to grant sublicenses) in its intellectual property portfolio of materials and technology related to human stem cell derived photoreceptor cells and retinal pigment epithelial cells (the “Licensed IP”), to use, commercialize and exploit any part thereof, in any manner whatsoever in the fields of the development and exploitation of (i) human stem cell derived photoreceptor cells, solely for use in cell therapy for the diagnosis, amelioration, prevention and treatment of eye disorders, and (ii) human stem cell derived retinal pigment epithelial cells, solely for use in cell therapy for the diagnosis, amelioration, prevention and treatment of eye disorders.
 
As consideration for the Licensed IP, Cell Cure paid a small one-time lump sum payment for reimbursement of intellectual property related expenses and will pay a royalty in the mid-single digits of net sales from sales of Licensed IP by any invoicing entity, and a royalty of 21.5% on sublicensing receipts. In addition, Cell Cure will pay Hadasit an annual minimal non-refundable royalty, which will become due and payable the first January 1 following the completion of services to Cell Cure by a research laboratory.
 
Cell Cure agreed to pay Hadasit non-refundable milestone payments upon the recruitment of the first patient for the first Phase IIB clinical trial, upon the enrollment of the first patient in the first Phase III clinical trials, upon delivery of the report for the first Phase III clinical trials, upon the receipt of an NDA or marketing approval in the European Union, whichever is the first to occur, and upon the first commercial sale in the United States or European Union, whichever is the first to occur. Such milestones, in the aggregate, may be up to $3.5 million. As of December 31, 2018, Cell Cure had not accrued any of these milestone payments.
 
The Hadasit License Agreement terminates upon the expiration of Cell Cure’s obligation to pay royalties for all licensed products, unless earlier terminated. In addition, the Hadasit License Agreement may be terminated by (i) Hadasit if, among other reasons, Cell Cure fails to continue the clinical development of the Licensed IP or fails to take actions to commercialize or sell the Licensed IP over any consecutive 12 month period, and (ii) by either party for (a) a material breach which remains uncured following a cure period, or (b) the granting of a winding-up order in respect of the other party, or upon an order being granted against the other party for the appointment of a receiver or a liquidator in respect of a substantial portion of such other party’s assets. The Hadasit License Agreement also contains customary indemnification obligations of Cell Cure.

License Agreement with University of California
 
Geron assigned to Asterias its exclusive license agreement with The Regents of the University of California dated June 2018 (the “UC License Agreement”) for patents covering a method for directing the differentiation of pPS cells to glial-restricted progenitor cells that generate pure populations of oligodendrocytes for remyelination and treatment of spinal cord injury. Under the UC License Agreement, we have an exclusive worldwide license under such patents, including the right to grant sublicenses, to create products for biological research, drug screening, and human therapy using the licensed patents.
 
Under the UC License Agreement, we will pay the university a royalty of 1% from sales of products that are covered by the licensed patent rights, and a minimum annual royalty of $5,000 starting in the year in which the first sale of a product covered by any licensed patent rights occurs and continuing for the life of the applicable patent right under the agreement. Under certain conditions, we will pay the university 7.5% of any proceeds, excluding debt financing and equity investments, and certain reimbursements, that we receive from sublicensees.
 
The UC License Agreement terminates on the expiration of the last-to-expire of the university’s issued licensed patents. If no further patents covered by the UC License Agreement are issued, it will terminate in 2024. The university may terminate the UC License Agreement if we breach it, and we can terminate it upon 60 days’ notice.
 
World-Wide Non-Exclusive WARF License
 
In October 2013, Asterias entered into a Non-Exclusive License Agreement with the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (“WARF”) under which Asterias was granted a worldwide non-exclusive license under certain WARF patents and WARF-owned embryonic stem cell lines to develop and commercialize therapeutic, diagnostic and research products. The licensed patents include patents covering methods for growth and differentiation of primate embryonic stem cells. The licensed stem cell lines include the H1, H7, H9, H13, and H14 hES cell lines.
 
In consideration of the rights licensed to us, we have agreed to pay WARF an upfront license fee and have agreed to additional payments upon the attainment of specified clinical development milestones, royalties on sales of commercialized products, and, subject to certain exclusions, a percentage of any payments that we may receive from any sublicenses that we may grant to use the licensed patents or stem cell lines.
 
The license agreement will terminate with respect to licensed patents upon the expiration of the last licensed patent to expire; with respect to the licensed stem cell lines, the license agreement will remain in force until terminated by either party in accordance with the termination provisions. We may terminate the license agreement at any time by giving WARF prior written notice. WARF may terminate the license agreement if: (1) payments of earned royalties, once begun, cease for a specified period of time, (2) we and any third parties collaborating or cooperating with us in the development of products using the licensed patents or stem cell lines fail to spend a specified minimum amount on research and development of products relating to the licensed patents or stem cell lines for a specified period of time, or (3) we breach the license agreement or become bankrupt or insolvent or if any of the licensed patents or stem cell lines are offered to creditors.
 
We will indemnify WARF and certain other designated affiliated entities from liability arising out of or relating to the death or injury of any person or damage to property due to the sale, marketing, use, or manufacture of products that are covered by the licensed patents, or licensed stem cells, or inventions or materials developed or derived from the licensed patents or stem cell lines.
 
Royalty Agreement with Geron
 
In connection with Asterias’s acquisition of Geron’s stem cell assets, in October 2013, we entered into a royalty agreement with Geron (the “Royalty Agreement”) pursuant to which we agreed to pay Geron a 4% royalty on net sales (as defined in the Royalty Agreement) by us or any of our affiliates or sales agents of any products that we develop and commercialize that are covered by the patents Geron contributed to us. In the case of sales of such products by a person other than us or one of our affiliates or sales agents, we will be required to pay Geron 50% of all royalties and cash payments received by us or by our affiliate in respect of a product sale. Royalty payments will be subject to proration in the event that a product covered by a patent acquired from Geron is sold in combination with another product that is not covered by a patent acquired from Geron. The Royalty Agreement will terminate at the expiration or termination date of the last issued patent contributed by Geron under the Royalty Agreement. We estimate that the latest patent expiration date will be in 2032.
AgeX License Agreement
 
Concurrently with our contribution of assets to AgeX in August 2017, we and AgeX entered into a license agreement pursuant to which we licensed to AgeX, with rights to sublicense, certain intellectual property, including patents and patent applications and know-how for use in the development, manufacture and commercialization of products or services for the prevention, treatment, amelioration, diagnosis or monitoring of all human and non-human animal diseases and conditions except for the field of medical products, devices and services for the reserved BioTime fields of orthopedic, ophthalmic and medical aesthetic uses. In addition, we retained an option right to license, on terms to be negotiated, certain patents in research, development, manufacturing and commercialization of treatments in the reserved BioTime fields. The licensed patents and know-how relate generally to (a) our PureStem human embryonic progenitor cell lines, and (b) telomere length and DNA quality control analysis in pluripotent stem cells.

17
--


The BioTime patent rights licensed to AgeX are exclusive and worldwide except for existing third-party licenses, and for medical products, devices, and services related to tendon. AgeX also received an option to license certain BioTime retained patent rights outside of orthopedic indications unless a license grant would compete with a BioTime program or products in the retained BioTime field.
 
We also agreed to license or sublicense to AgeX certain additional patents and patent rights and know-how relating to BioTime HyStem hydrogel technology, human embryonic progenitor cell technology, and human pluripotent stem cell lines and technology for use outside the fields reserved to BioTime or in the case of certain sublicense rights in fields previously licensed to third parties.
 
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 
Government authorities at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries, extensively regulate among other things, the development, testing, manufacture, quality, approval, safety, efficacy, distribution, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, marketing, import/export and promotion of drugs, biologics, and medical devices. Laboratories performing diagnostic tests such as those being developed by OncoCyte are also subject to regulation at both the federal and state level. Authorities also heavily regulate many of these activities for human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products or HCT/Ps.
 
FDA and Foreign Regulation of Therapeutic Products
 
The FDA and foreign regulatory authorities will regulate our proposed products as drugs, biologicals, or medical devices, depending upon such factors as the use to which the product will be put, the chemical composition, and the interaction of the product with the human body. In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and biologicals under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and implementing regulations. In addition, establishments that manufacture human cells, tissues, and HCT/Ps are subject to additional registration and listing requirements, including current good tissue practice regulations. Certain cell therapy proposed products will be reviewed by the FDA staff in its Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (“CBER”) Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies.
 
Our domestic human drug and biological products will be subject to rigorous FDA review and approval procedures. After testing in animals to evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of the product candidate, an investigational new drug (“IND”) submission must be made to the FDA to obtain authorization for human testing. Extensive clinical testing, which is generally done in three phases, must then be undertaken to demonstrate optimal use, safety, and efficacy of each product in humans. Each clinical study is conducted under the auspices of an independent Institutional Review Board (“IRB”). The IRB will consider, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects, and the possible liability of the institution.
 
Phase I clinical trials are conducted in a small number of healthy volunteers or volunteers with the target disease or condition to assess safety. Phase II clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with the target disease or condition in order to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety. In some cases, an initial trial is conducted in diseased patients to assess both preliminary efficacy and preliminary safety, in which case it is referred to as a Phase I/II trial. Phase III trials are large-scale, multi-center, comparative trials and are conducted with patients afflicted with the target disease or condition in order to provide enough data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety required by the FDA. The FDA closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical testing and may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend, or terminate the clinical trial based upon the data which have been accumulated to that point and its assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the intended patient population. All adverse events must be reported to the FDA. Monitoring of all aspects of the study to minimize risks is a continuing process.
 
No action can be taken to market any therapeutic product in the U.S. until an appropriate New Drug Application (“NDA”) or Biologics License Application (BLA) has been approved by the FDA. Submission of the application is not a guarantee that the FDA will find it complete and accept it for filing. If an application is accepted for filing, following the FDA’s review, the FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional information or deny the application if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval. FDA regulations also restrict the export of therapeutic products for clinical use prior to FDA approval. To date, the FDA has not granted marketing approval to any pluripotent stem-based therapeutic products and it is possible that the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies may subject our product candidates to additional or more stringent review than drugs or biologicals derived from other technologies.

--


The FDA offers several programs to expedite development of products that treat serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefits to patients over existing treatments. A drug is eligible for designation as a regenerative medicine advanced therapy (“RMAT,” formerly known as “Regenerative Advanced Therapy”) if: the drug is a regenerative medicine therapy, which is defined as a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or any combination product using such therapies or products, except for those regulated solely under certain other sections; the drug is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Some of our current and future products may be eligible for RMAT designation. RMAT designation allows for similar benefits as the breakthrough therapy designation. There is no assurance that the FDA will grant RMAT status to any of our product candidates.
 
Certain Medical Devices
 
Obtaining regulatory approval of Renevia or a similar implantable matrix for tissue transplant or stem cell therapy in Europe will require the preparation of a design dossier containing details on the product manufacturing and production methods, analytical controls to assure that the product meets its release specification, data from analytical assay and process validations, ISO 10993 biocompatibility testing, as well as pre-clinical and clinical safety and efficacy data. Completion of the manufacturing, analytical, biocompatibility, and clinical trials represents a majority of the expenses associated with the regulatory application process in Europe.
Combination Products
 
If we develop any products that are used with medical devices, they may be considered combination products, which are defined by the FDA to include products comprised of two or more regulated components or parts such as a biologic and a device. For example, our HyStem hydrogel products such as Renevia may be used to administer one or more pluripotent stem cell-based therapy products. When regulated independently, biologics and devices each have their own regulatory requirements. However, the regulatory requirements for a combination product comprised of a biologic administered with a delivery device can be more complex, because in addition to the individual regulatory requirements for each component, additional combination product regulatory requirements may apply. There is an Office of Combination Products at the FDA that coordinates the review of such products and determines the primary mode of action of a combination product. The definition and regulatory requirements for combination products may differ significantly among countries in which we may seek approval of our product candidates.
 
FDA Regulation of Manufacturing
 
The FDA regulates the manufacturing process of pharmaceutical products, human tissue and cell products, and medical devices, requiring that they be produced in compliance with cGMP. See “Manufacturing.” The FDA regulates and inspects equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of products prior to providing approval to market products. If after receiving approval from the FDA, a material change is made to manufacturing equipment or to the location or manufacturing process, additional regulatory review may be required. The FDA also conducts regular, periodic visits to re-inspect the equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes of manufacturers following an initial approval. If, as a result of those inspections, the FDA determines that that equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable FDA regulations and conditions of product approval, the FDA may seek civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against the manufacturer, including suspension of manufacturing operations. Issues pertaining to manufacturing equipment, facilities or processes may also delay the approval of new products undergoing FDA review.
 
FDA Regulation of Advertising and Product Promotion
 
The FDA also regulates the content of advertisements used to market pharmaceutical and biological products. Claims made in advertisements concerning the safety and efficacy of a product, or any advantages of a product over another product, must be supported by clinical data filed as part of an NDA, a BLA, or a pre-market notification or pre-market approval application for a medical device (“PMA”), or an amendment to an NDA, a BLA, or a pre-market notification or PMA, and must be consistent with the FDA approved labeling and dosage information for that product.
 
Foreign Regulation
 
Sales of pharmaceutical products outside the U.S. are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. Even if FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing the product in those countries. The time required to obtain such approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.

Federal Funding of Research
 
The United States government and its agencies previously refused to fund research which involves the use of human embryonic tissue. President Bush issued Executive Orders on August 9, 2001 and June 20, 2007 that permitted federal funding of research on hES cells using only the limited number of hES cell lines that had already been created as of August 9, 2001. On March 9, 2009, President Obama issued an Executive Order rescinding President Bush’s August 9, 2001 and June 20, 2007 Executive Orders. President Obama’s Executive Order also instructed the NIH to review existing guidance on human stem cell research and to issue new guidance on the use of hES cells in federally funded research, consistent with the new Executive Order and existing law. In accordance with this Executive Order and existing law, the NIH adopted guidelines that went into effect July 7, 2009. The central focus of the guidelines was to assure that hES cells used in federally funded research were derived from human embryos that were created for reproductive purposes, were no longer needed for this purpose, and were voluntarily donated for research purposes with the informed written consent of the donors. Those hES cells that were derived from embryos created for research purposes rather than reproductive purposes, and other hES cells that were not derived in compliance with the guidelines, were and remain ineligible for use in federally funded research.
 
In addition to President Obama’s Executive Order, bipartisan legislation was introduced on June 19, 2013 in the U.S. House of Representatives which would allow for Federal funding of hES research. The House bill is similar to one that was previously approved by both Houses of Congress but vetoed by President Bush. The House bill provides that hES cells would be eligible for use in research conducted or supported by federal funding if the cells meet each of the following guidelines: (1) the stem cells were derived from human embryos that were created using in vitro fertilization for reproductive purposes, and are no longer needed by the individuals seeking such treatment, and (2) the individuals seeking reproductive treatment donated the embryos to be used for research purposes with written and voluntary informed consent and without receiving any financial or other inducements to make the donation. The House bill would authorize the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and the NIH to adopt further guidelines applicable to the conduct or support of human stem cell research consistent with this proposed legislation.
 
Although no legislation permitting Federal funding of hES research has been advanced by Congress, the scope of the Dickey-Wicker Amendment, which prohibits the use of federal funding for activity related to the harm or destruction of a human embryo, was determined by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit not to preclude funding of hES research. With the Supreme Court declining review of the appeal in 2013, the ruling has been allowed to stand. Additionally, the 21st Century Cures Act, signed into law in 2016, included provisions facilitating timely FDA review and approval of regenerative cell therapies enabled by stem cell therapy research, albeit limited to adult stem cells.
 
California State Regulations
 
The state of California has adopted legislation and regulations that require institutions that conduct stem cell research to notify, and in certain cases, including research involving the creation or use of human embryos, obtain approval in writing from a Stem Cell Research Oversight Committee (“SCRO Committee”) before conducting the research. Under certain California regulations, all hES cell lines that will be used in our research must be acceptably derived.
 
We also comply with certain California regulations that require certain records to be maintained with respect to stem cell research and the materials used.
 
We have formed a SCRO Committee which reviews each of BioTime’s projects that involve the use of pluripotent stem cells. The Committee reviews and confirms that we are using only hES cell lines that have been acceptably derived and that the research conducted using these cell lines is both scientifically and ethically justified under existing California regulations. The OpRegen program has been reviewed by the SCRO Committee and we believe that we comply with applicable federal and state guidelines. The hES cell lines that we use are all on the NIH registry of lines that have been reviewed and meet standards for federal funding grants.
 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
 
Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), the HHS has issued regulations to protect the privacy and security of protected health information. HIPAA also regulates standardization of data content, codes and formats used in health care transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and providers. Penalties for violations of HIPAA regulations include civil and criminal penalties.
Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws
 
A variety of federal and state laws prohibit fraud and abuse. These laws are interpreted broadly and enforced aggressively by various state and federal agencies, including the Centers for Medicare & Medical Services (CMS), the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General for HHS, and various state agencies. In addition, the Medicare and Medicaid programs increasingly use a variety of contractors to review claims data and to identify improper payments as well as fraud and abuse. These contractors include Recovery Audit Contractors, Medicaid Integrity Contractors and Zone Program Integrity Contractors. In addition, CMS conducts Comprehensive Error Rate Testing audits, the purpose of which is to detect improper Medicare payments. Any overpayments identified must be repaid unless a favorable decision is obtained on appeal. In some cases, these overpayments can be used as the basis for an extrapolation, by which the error rate is applied to a larger universe of claims, and which can result in even higher repayments.

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce or in return for either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any health care item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under a federal health care program. The definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including gifts, discounts, credit arrangements, payments of cash, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Recognizing that the federal Anti- Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements within the health care industry, the Office of Inspector General for HHS has issued a series of regulatory “safe harbors.” These safe harbor regulations set forth certain requirements that, if met, will assure immunity from prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Although full compliance with these provisions ensures against prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit within a specific safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the transaction or arrangement is illegal or that prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute will be pursued. Additionally, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, ACA) codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act.
 
The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent.
 
HIPAA also created new federal crimes, including health care fraud and false statements relating to health care matters. The health care fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private third-party payers. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services.
 
The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act which require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to CMS information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
 
Many states have laws similar to the federal laws described above and the state laws may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third party payors, including private insurers, or that apply regardless of payor, state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, state and local laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, state laws that require the reporting of information related to drug pricing, and state and local laws requiring the registration of pharmaceutical sales and medical representatives.
 
Additionally, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and/or regulations.
 
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above, or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject significant civil, criminal and administrative sanctions, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, imprisonment, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment or restructuring of our operations.

Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Patients generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse part or all of the costs associated with medical products. Accordingly, market acceptance of medical products can depend on the extent to which third-party coverage and reimbursement is available from government health administration authorities, private healthcare insurers and other healthcare funding organizations.
 
For example, in the United States, healthcare providers are reimbursed for covered services and products they deliver through Medicare, Medicaid and other government healthcare programs, as well as through private payers. Pharmacies are also reimbursed in a similar manner for drug products they dispense. Pharmaceutical companies may be required to provide specified rebates or discounts on the products it sells to certain government funded programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, and those rebates or discounts have increased over time. The ACA increased many of these mandatory discounts and rebates required and imposed a new Branded Prescription Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Importers fee payable each year certain pharmaceutical companies and manufacturers.
 
Outside of the United States, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be significantly lower.

MARKETING
 
Plasma Volume Expanders
 
Hextend® is being distributed in the U.S. by Hospira and in South Korea by CJ Healthcare under exclusive licenses from us. Because Hextend is a surgical product, sales efforts are directed to physicians and hospitals. Hextend competes with other products used to treat or prevent hypovolemia, including albumin, generic 6% hetastarch solutions, and crystalloid solutions. The competing products have been commonly used in surgery and trauma care for many years, and in order to sell Hextend, physicians must be convinced to change their product loyalties. The market price of albumin has declined and generic 6% hetastarch solutions sell at low prices, which has caused Hospira and CJ Healthcare to lower the prices at which they sell Hextend.

22
--


In addition to price competition, sales of Hextend have been adversely affected if certain safety labeling changes required by the FDA for the entire class of hydroxyethyl starch products, including Hextend. The labeling changes were approved by the FDA in November 2013 and include a boxed warning stating that the use of hydroxyethyl starch products, including Hextend, increases the risk of mortality and renal injury requiring renal replacement therapy in critically ill adult patients, including patients with sepsis, and that Hextend should not be used in critically ill adult patients, including patients with sepsis. Warning and precaution information is required along with information about contraindications, adverse reactions, and certain recent studies. The warning and precautions include avoiding the use of Hextend in patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction, that the coagulation status of patients undergoing open heart surgery in association with cardiopulmonary bypass should be monitored as excess bleeding has been reported with hydroxyethyl starch solutions in that population, that the use of Hextend should be discontinued at the first sign of coagulopathy, and that the liver function of patients receiving hydroxyethyl starch products, including Hextend should also be monitored.
 
Therapeutic Products and Medical Devices
 
Because our planned therapeutic products and medical devices are still in the research and development stage, we will not initially need to have our own marketing personnel. If we or our subsidiaries are successful in developing marketable therapeutic products and medical devices, we will need to build our own marketing and distribution capability for those products, which would require the investment of significant financial and management resources, or we and our subsidiaries will need to find collaborative marketing partners, independent sales representatives, or wholesale distributors for the commercial sale of those products.
 
If we market products through arrangements with third parties, we may pay sales commissions to sales representatives or we may sell or consign products to distributors at wholesale prices. This means that our gross profit from product sales may be less than would be the case if we were to sell our products directly to end users at retail prices through our own sales force. On the other hand, selling to distributors or through independent sales representatives would allow us to avoid the cost of hiring and training our own sales employees. There can be no assurance we will be able to negotiate distribution or sales agreements with third parties on favorable terms to justify our investment in our products or achieve sufficient revenues to support our operations.
 
COMPETITION
 
We face substantial competition in all of fields of business in which we engage. That competition is likely to intensify as new products and technologies reach the market. Superior new products are likely to sell for higher prices and generate higher profit margins if acceptance by the medical community is achieved. Those companies that are successful at being the first to introduce new products and technologies to the market may gain significant economic advantages over their competitors in the establishment of a customer base and track record for the performance of their products and technologies. Such companies will also benefit from revenues from sales that could be used to strengthen their research and development, production, and marketing resources. Companies engaged in the medical products industry face the risk of obsolescence of their products and technologies as more advanced or cost-effective products and technologies are developed by competitors. As the industry matures, companies will compete based upon the performance and cost-effectiveness of their products.
Products for Regenerative Medicine
 
The cell therapy industry is characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition. Our competitors include major multinational pharmaceutical companies, specialty biotechnology companies, and chemical and medical products companies operating in the fields of regenerative medicine, cell therapy, tissue engineering, and tissue regeneration. Many of these companies are well established and possess technical, research and development, financial, and sales and marketing resources significantly greater than ours. In addition, certain smaller biotech companies have formed strategic collaborations, partnerships, and other types of joint ventures with larger, well-established industry competitors that afford the smaller companies’ potential research and development as well as commercialization advantages. Academic institutions, governmental agencies, and other public and private research organizations are also conducting and financing research activities, which may produce products directly competitive to those we are developing.
 
We believe that some of our competitors are trying to develop pluripotent cells and hEPC-based technologies and products that may compete with our stem cell products based on efficacy, safety, cost, and intellectual property positions. Ocata, which was recently acquired by a subsidiary of Astellas Pharma Inc., and Retinal Patch Technologies Inc. are conducting clinical trials of a hES cell products designed to treat age-related macular degeneration. If their products are proven to be safe and effective, they may reach the market ahead of OpRegen.
 
We may also face competition from companies that have filed patent applications relating to the propagation and differentiation of stem cells. Those companies include Ocata, which in 2015 had certain U.S. patents issue with claims directed to methods of producing RPE cells and isolating and purifying such cells. We may be required to seek licenses from these competitors in order to commercialize certain products proposed by us, and such licenses may not be granted.
