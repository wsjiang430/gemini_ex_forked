ITEM 1.BUSINESS
Introduction
We own and operate regional theme parks and water parks. We are the largest regional theme park operator in the world and the largest operator of water parks in North America based on the number of parks we operate. Of our 27 regional theme parks and water parks, 24 are located in the United States, two are located in Mexico and one is located in Montreal, Canada. Our U.S. parks serve each of the top 10 designated market areas, as determined by a survey of television households within designated market areas published by A.C. Nielsen Media Research in Fall 2022. Our diversified portfolio of North American parks serves an aggregate population of approximately 145 million people and 250 million people within a radius of 50 miles and 100 miles, respectively, with some of the highest per capita gross domestic product in the U.S.
We generate revenue primarily from selling admission to our parks and from the sale of food, beverages, merchandise and other products and services within our parks.
Our parks occupy approximately 5,850 acres of land, and we own approximately 700 additional acres of land with development potential. Our parks are located in geographically diverse markets across North America. Our parks generally offer a broad selection of state-of-the-art and traditional thrill rides, water attractions, themed areas, concerts and shows, restaurants, game venues and retail outlets, and thereby provide a complete family-oriented entertainment experience. In the aggregate, during 2022, our parks contained approximately 940 rides, including over 140 roller coasters, making us the leading provider of "thrill rides" in the industry.
Developing new parks is resource intensive, given a limited supply of real estate appropriate for theme park development, substantial initial capital investment requirements, long development lead-time, and zoning restrictions. Based on our knowledge of the development of our own and other regional theme parks, we estimate it would take a minimum of four years to plan and construct a new regional theme park comparable to one of our major Six Flags-branded parks.
We own the internationally recognized "Six Flags" brand name in the U.S. and other countries throughout the world. To capitalize on this name recognition, 23 of our parks are branded as "Six Flags" or "Hurricane Harbor" parks, and we are working with a third party that is developing a Six Flags-branded theme park in Saudi Arabia. We license the right to use certain Warner Bros. and DC Comics characters at our theme parks, which provide an enhanced family entertainment experience and theming.
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic had material effects on our business during the years ended January 2, 2022, and December 31, 2020, through the temporary suspension of operations at our parks. During the year ended January 2, 2022, our parks in California and Mexico had fewer operating days than planned due to COVID-19 related closures. All of our parks were closed for at least a portion of 2020. COVID-19 and its variants continue to present material uncertainty and risk with respect to our performance and financial results, including our ability to keep all of our parks open to our guests. We will continue to consider near-term exigencies and the long-term financial health of the business as we take steps to mitigate the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacts our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including any additional actions we have taken, or will take, to minimize the spread of COVID-19 and its variants or manage its impact.

Fiscal Calendar Change
Holdings’ Board of Directors of determined that it is in our best interest to change the method of determining our fiscal quarters and fiscal years, such that each fiscal quarter will consist of thirteen weeks ending on a Sunday and each fiscal year will consist of 52 or 53 weeks, as applicable, and will end on the Sunday closest to December 31, effective as of the commencement of our fiscal year on January 1, 2021. This change was made to align our fiscal reporting calendar with how we operate our business and improve comparability across periods. This Annual Report covers the period January 3, 2022, through January 1, 2023 (“the year ended January 1, 2023” or “2022”). The comparison period in the prior year covers January 1, 2021, through January 2, 2022 (“the year ended January 2, 2022” or “2021”). The year ended January 2, 2022, contained three extra days due to the calendar change from calendar year reporting. The year ended December 31, 2020, covers the period between January 1, 2020, through December 31, 2020 (“the year ended December 31, 2020” or “2020”).
Strategic Plan
In December 2021, we made changes to our organizational structure, including to our leadership team, by reducing layers of management to more effectively align resources to business priorities and empower our park employees. We believe that the Company’s success will be realized through the engagement and empowerment of our employees. We are focused on developing a dynamic, performance-driven culture centered on the guest and fostering a spirit of innovation, which has always been at our core.
Under our new leadership, our strategy is focused on delivering long-term, profitable growth by continuously enhancing the guest experience and by operating efficiently. In particular, we are focusing our efforts on four pillars:

● | Upgrading all aspects of our parks and experiences for our guests and our employees;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Adjusting our pricing and product architecture to strategically optimize attendance;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Amplifying new and evolving seasonal events in our parks; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | Developing a park-centric culture of agility, autonomy, urgency and performance.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
As we execute on our strategy, our approach to capital allocation focuses on reinvesting in the business and decreasing financial leverage. We are also committed to working more efficiently and being disciplined with costs. 
Description of Parks and Segment Information
Our parks provide similar products and services through a similar process to the same class of customer through a consistent method. We also believe our parks share common economic characteristics. Based on these factors, we have only one reportable segment—theme parks. The following chart summarizes key business and geographical information about our parks.

Partnership Park Arrangements
In 1998, we acquired the former Six Flags Entertainment Corporation ("Former SFEC", a corporation that has been merged out of existence and that had always been a separate corporation from Holdings), which had operated regional theme parks and water parks under the Six Flags name for nearly forty years. In connection with this acquisition, we guaranteed certain obligations relating to Six Flags Over Texas ("SFOT") and Six Flags Over Georgia, including Six Flags White Water Atlanta ("SFOG", and together with SFOT, the "Partnership Parks"). These obligations continue until 2027, in the case of SFOG, and 2028, in the case of SFOT. Such obligations include (i) minimum annual distributions (including rent) of approximately $85.6 million in 2023 (subject to cost of living adjustments in subsequent years) to the limited partners of the Partnership Parks (based on our ownership of units as of January 1, 2023, our share of such distribution will be approximately $38.1 million) and (ii) minimum capital expenditures at each park during rolling five-year periods based generally on 6% of Partnership Park revenues. Given recent increases in consumer price index, for 2023, we will pay approximately $5 million more in minimum distributions to the limited partners than in 2022. Cash flow from operations at the Partnership Parks is used to satisfy these requirements before any funds are required from us. We also guaranteed the obligation of our subsidiaries to annually purchase all outstanding limited partnership units to the extent tendered by the unit holders (the "Partnership Park Put").
After payment of the minimum distribution, we are entitled to a management fee equal to 3% of prior year gross revenues and, thereafter, any additional cash will be distributed first to management fee in arrears, then repayment of any interest and principal on intercompany loans, with any additional cash being distributed 95% to us, in the case of SFOG, and 92.5% to us, in the case of SFOT.
The agreed price for units tendered in the Partnership Park Put is based on a valuation of each of the respective Partnership Parks (the "Specified Price") that is the greater of (i) a valuation for each of the respective Partnership Parks derived by multiplying such park’s weighted average four year EBITDA (as defined in the agreements that govern the partnerships) by a specified multiple (8.0 in the case of SFOG and 8.5 in the case of SFOT) and (ii) a valuation derived from the highest prices previously paid for the units of the Partnership Parks by certain entities. In light of the temporary suspension of operations of the Partnership Parks due to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, which would cause the value of the limited partnership units of the Partnership Parks to decrease in 2021 and thereafter, we adjusted our annual offer to purchase these units. Accordingly, to preserve liquidity in 2020 and avoid uncertainty with future purchase prices for the units, we adjusted the 2020 offer price to set a minimum price floor for all future purchases. Pursuant to the valuation methodologies described in the preceding sentence, the Specified Price for the Partnership Parks, if determined as of January 1, 2023, is $409.7 million in the case of SFOG, and $527.4 million in the case of SFOT. As of January 1, 2023, we owned approximately 31.5% and 54.1% of the Georgia limited partner interests and Texas limited partner interests, respectively. The remaining redeemable units of approximately 68.5% and 45.9% of the Georgia limited partner and Texas limited partner, respectively, represent a current redemption value for the limited partnership units of approximately $521.4 million.
Pursuant to the 2022 annual offer, we did not purchase units from the Georgia partnership. We purchased 0.25358 units from the Texas partnership for approximately $0.6 million in May 2022. The $350 million accordion feature on the Second Amended and Restated Term Loan B (as defined in Note 8, Long-Term Indebtedness, to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report) is available for borrowing for future "put" obligations if necessary.
In connection with our acquisition of the Former SFEC, we entered into the Subordinated Indemnity Agreement with certain of the Company’s entities, Time Warner, and an affiliate of Time Warner (an indirect subsidiary of AT&T Inc. as a result of a merger in 2018), pursuant to which, among other things, we transferred to Time Warner (which has guaranteed all of our obligations under the Partnership Park arrangements) record title to the corporations that own the entities that purchase limited partnership units of the Partnership Parks, and we received an assignment from Time Warner of all cash flow received on such limited partnership units, and we otherwise control such entities. In addition, we issued preferred stock of the managing partner of the partnerships to Time Warner. In the event of a default by us under the Subordinated Indemnity Agreement or of our obligations to our partners in the Partnership Parks, these arrangements would permit Time Warner to take full control of both the entities that own limited partnership units and the managing partner. If we satisfy all such obligations, Time Warner is required to transfer to us the entire equity interests of these entities at the end of the term, which is 2027 for SFOG and 2028 for SFOT. The 2022 sale of Time

Warner to Discovery did not affect the Time Warner guarantee of our obligations under the Subordinated Indemnity Agreement.
We incurred $20.6 million of capital expenditures at these parks during the 2022 season, and intend to incur at least the minimum required expenditure in 2023. Cash flows from operations at the Partnership Parks will be used to satisfy the annual distribution and capital expenditure requirements before any funds are required from us. The two partnerships generated approximately $73.0 million of cash in 2022 in operating activities after deduction of capital expenditures and excluding the impact of short-term intercompany advances from or payments to Holdings, as the case may be. As of January 1, 2023, and January 2, 2022, we had total loans receivable outstanding of $288.3 million from the partnerships that own the Partnership Parks. The proceeds from these loans were primarily used to fund the acquisition of Six Flags White Water Atlanta and to make capital improvements and distributions to the limited partners.
Marketing and Promotion
We attract visitors through multichannel marketing and promotional programs for each of our parks. The programs are designed to attract guests and enhance the Six Flags brand name. They are tailored to address the different characteristics of our various markets and to maximize the impact of specific park attractions and product introductions. Marketing and promotional programs are updated or replaced each year to address new developments.
We also seek to develop long-term corporate sponsorship and co-marketing relationships with well-known regional and national brands that align with our values and strategy. This allows us to develop strategic alliances with mutually beneficial advertising programs. 
During the year ended January 1, 2023, we had two primary pass products. Our season pass products offers unlimited visits to a specified park whenever it is open and is valid for one operating season or such other date stated in the pass product. Our legacy membership program offers unlimited visits to most of our parks and automatically renews monthly after a one-year commitment period. The program was discontinued during 2022, however, existing members can continue to renew monthly until cancellation or default. Season pass and membership sales represent advance purchase commitments that reduce exposure to inclement weather and economic downturns. In general, a season pass holder or member contributes higher aggregate revenue and profitability to the Company over the course of a year compared to a single-day guest. A season pass holder or member pays a higher ticket price and contributes to in-park guest spending over multiple visits. Additionally, guests enrolled in our membership program and season pass holders often bring paying guests and generate "word-of-mouth" advertising for the parks. Single-day guests tend to spend more per visit. We will continue to strive for a balanced mix of guests to maximize revenue. Season pass and membership attendance constituted approximately 54% and 63% of total attendance at our parks in 2022 and 2021, respectively. We plan to offer primarily season passes and single day tickets during 2023, while continuing to honor our legacy membership program. 
Our Group Sales team organizes events and outings for various groups at our parks, including customized catering, coordination of tickets and event planning. 
We use limited promotional programs as a means of targeting specific market segments and locations not generally reached through group or retail sales efforts. The promotional programs utilize coupons, sweepstakes, reward incentives and rebates to attract additional visitors. These programs are implemented through online promotions, digital and social marketing activities, search engine marketing, radio and television advertising, direct mail, and sponsorship marketing. The special promotional offers are usually available for a limited time and provide some additional incentive to purchase a ticket.

Licenses
We hold exclusive long-term licenses of the Warner Bros. and DC Comics animated characters at our theme parks throughout the U.S. (except for the Las Vegas metropolitan area), Canada, Mexico and certain other countries. In particular, our license agreements entitle us to use, subject to customary approval rights of Warner Bros. and, in limited circumstances, approval rights of certain third parties, all animated, cartoon and comic book characters that Warner Bros. and DC Comics have the right to license, including Batman, The Joker, Superman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Green Lantern, Harley Quinn, Aquaman, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Tweety Bird and Yosemite Sam. The licenses include the right to sell merchandise using the characters and to use the characters in our advertising, as walk-around characters and in theming for rides, attractions and retail outlets. In addition to annual license fees, we are required to pay a royalty fee on any merchandise manufactured by or for us and sold that use the licensed characters. Warner Bros. has the right to terminate the license agreements under certain circumstances, including if any persons involved in the movie or television industries obtain control of us or, in the case of Warner Bros., upon a default under the Subordinated Indemnity Agreement.
Park Operations
We currently operate in geographically diverse markets in North America. Each park is managed by a park president or general manager who is responsible for all operations and management of the individual park. Each park president or general manager directs a full-time, on-site management team. Local advertising, ticket sales, community relations and hiring and training of personnel are the responsibility of individual park management in coordination with corporate support teams.
Each park has senior personnel responsible for operations and maintenance; in-park food, beverage, merchandising and games; marketing and sales; public safety and risk management; human resources and finance. Park management compensation structures are designed to provide financial incentives for individual park managers to execute our strategy and to maximize revenue and free cash flow.
Our parks are generally open daily from Memorial Day through Labor Day. In addition, most of our parks are open weekends prior to and following their daily seasons, often in conjunction with themed events such as Fright Fest® and Holiday in the Park®. Due to their location, certain parks have longer operating seasons. Six Flags Magic Mountain operates on most days year-round, and our parks in Mexico, Six Flags Fiesta Texas and Six Flags Over Texas operate weekends year-round outside of their traditional operating season. Typically, the parks charge a basic daily admission price that allows unlimited use of all rides and attractions, although in certain cases special rides and attractions require the payment of an additional fee. 
See Note 17, Business Segments, to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for information concerning revenues and long-lived assets by domestic and international categories.
Capital Improvements and Other Initiatives
We regularly make capital investments for new rides and attractions in our parks. We purchase both new and used rides and attractions. On occasion, we also relocate rides among parks to provide fresh attractions. In addition, each year we make capital investments in the food, retail, games and other in-park areas to increase guest spending per capita. We also make annual enhancements to theming and landscaping of our parks in order to provide a more complete family-oriented entertainment experience and invest in our information technology infrastructure to attain operational efficiencies. We regularly perform maintenance capital enhancements, with most expenditures made during the off-season. Repairs and maintenance costs for materials and services associated with maintaining assets, such as painting and inspecting existing rides, are expensed as incurred and are not included in capital expenditures.
Our capital plan will continue to selectively add new coasters over time to our exceptional portfolio of thrill rides; however, our near-term focus will be a balanced approach between exciting new rides and an increased focus on implementing guest-facing technology, food service equipment, amenities, infrastructure improvements, events and festivals in our parks, as well as enhancing the overall experience in our water parks. 

7



During 2023, we plan to enhance our targeted marketing strategies to attract new-to-brand consumers and convert them to loyal guests, by (i) elevating our overall guest experience and focusing on our breadth of product in our theme parks and water parks; (ii) simplifying our admissions product offerings (iii) developing guest-focused in-park initiatives to drive guest spending growth; (iv) taking a balanced approach to single day ticket and season pass sales; and (v) growing group sales and sponsorship revenue opportunities back to pre-pandemic levels or higher.
International Agreements
We are working with a third party that is developing a Six Flags-branded park in Saudi Arabia. As compensation for exclusivity, brand licensing rights, and design, development and management services, we receive fees during the design and development period as well as ongoing remuneration after the park opens to the public. The agreements do not require us to make any capital investments in the park. We plan to focus on our core business over the next two to three years; during this time, we will be cautious about expanding into adjacent domestic markets or entering into new international agreements.
Maintenance and Inspection
Rides are inspected at various levels and frequencies in accordance with manufacturer specifications. Our rides are inspected daily during the operating season by our maintenance personnel. These inspections include safety checks, as well as regular maintenance, and are made through both visual inspection and test operations of the rides. Our senior management and the individual park personnel evaluate the risk aspects of each park’s operations, potential risks to employees and staff as well as to the public. In addition, contingency response plans for potential emergency situations have been developed for each facility. During the off-season, maintenance personnel examine the rides and repair, refurbish and rebuild them when necessary. This process includes x-raying and magnafluxing (a further examination for minute cracks and defects) steel portions of certain rides at high-stress points. A large portion of our full-time workforce devotes substantially all of its time to maintaining the parks and our rides and attractions. We use a computerized maintenance-management system across all of our domestic parks to assist us in executing our maintenance programs. 
​
In addition to the performance of our internal maintenance and inspection procedures, we, or our insurance carriers, as the case may be, retain third party consultants to perform an annual inspection of each park and all attractions. The results of these inspections are reported in written evaluation and inspection reports and include suggestions on various aspects of park operations. In certain states, state inspectors conduct additional annual ride inspections before the beginning of each season. Other portions of each park are subject to inspections by local fire marshals and health and building department officials. Furthermore, we use Ellis & Associates as water safety consultants at all of our water parks to train lifeguards and audit safety procedures.
Insurance
We maintain insurance of the types and in amounts we believe are commercially reasonable and are available to businesses in our industry. We maintain multi-layered general liability policies that provide for excess liability coverage of up to $100.0 million per occurrence. For incidents arising on or after December 31, 2008, our self-insured retention is $2.0 million, followed by a $0.5 million deductible per occurrence applicable to all claims in the policy year for our domestic parks and our park in Canada and a nominal amount per occurrence for our parks in Mexico. Defense costs are in addition to these retentions. Our general liability policies cover the cost of punitive damages only in certain jurisdictions. Based upon reported claims and an estimate for incurred, but not reported claims, we accrue a liability for our retention contingencies. For workers’ compensation claims arising after November 15, 2003, our deductible is $0.75 million. We also maintain fire and extended coverage, business interruption, terrorism and other forms of insurance typical to businesses in this industry. The all peril property coverage policies insure our real and personal properties (other than land) against physical damage resulting from a variety of hazards. Additionally, we maintain information security and privacy liability insurance in the amount of $10.0 million with a $0.25 million retention per event.

8



We generally renegotiate our insurance policies on an annual basis. The majority of our current insurance policies expire on December 31, 2023. We cannot predict the level of the premiums that we may be required to pay for subsequent insurance coverage, the level of any retention applicable thereto, the level of aggregate coverage available or the availability of coverage for specific risks.
Competition
Our parks compete with other theme parks, water parks, amusement parks, as well as with other types of recreational facilities and forms of out-of-home entertainment within their market areas, including movies, sporting events, restaurants and vacation travel. Competitors of our parks include SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc.; Cedar Fair, L.P.; NBCUniversal/Universal Parks & Resorts; Disney Parks; Herschend Family Entertainment Corporation; Hershey Entertainment & Resorts Company; Merlin Entertainment Ltd.; Palace Entertainment; Premier Parks, LLC; Boomers Parks and a number of other regional and local competitors in the geographies in which we operate. In addition, our business is subject to various factors affecting the recreation and leisure industries generally, such as general economic conditions and changes in discretionary consumer spending habits. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors" of this Annual Report. Within each park’s regional market area, the principal factors affecting direct theme park competition include location, price, the uniqueness and perceived safety and quality of the rides and attractions in the park, the atmosphere and cleanliness of the park, the quality of park food and entertainment, and ease of travel to the park. Our theme parks have several advantages over other forms of entertainment. We believe that our parks offer a sufficient quality and variety of rides and attractions, culinary offerings, retail locations, and interactive and family experiences to make them highly competitive with other parks and forms of entertainment. They are outdoor venues spread over hundreds of acres, making them naturally conducive to social distancing. They are open many hours throughout the day, reducing the need for guests to arrive or leave at the same time. Finally, the vast majority of our guests live within a day’s drive, so a visit to one of our parks does not require air travel or a stay at a hotel. 
​
Seasonality
Our operations are highly seasonal, with approximately 70% of park attendance and revenues in a typical year occurring in the second and third calendar quarters of each year, with the most significant period falling between Memorial Day and Labor Day.
Environmental and Other Regulations
Our operations are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations including laws and regulations governing water and sewer discharges, air emissions, soil and groundwater contamination, the maintenance of underground and aboveground storage tanks and the disposal of waste and hazardous materials. In addition, our operations are subject to other local, state and federal governmental regulations including, without limitation, labor, health, safety, zoning and land use and minimum wage regulations applicable to theme park and water park operations, and local and state regulations applicable to restaurant operations at each park. Finally, certain of our facilities are subject to laws and regulations relating to the care of animals. We believe that we are in compliance with applicable environmental and other laws and regulations and, although no assurance can be given, we do not foresee the need for any significant expenditures in this area in the near future.
Portions of the undeveloped areas at certain of our parks are classified as wetlands. Accordingly, we may need to obtain governmental permits and other approvals prior to conducting development activities that affect these areas and future development may be prohibited in some or all of these areas. Additionally, the presence of wetlands in portions of our undeveloped land could adversely affect our ability to dispose of such land and/or the price we receive in any such disposition.

Environmental, Social and Governance
We are committed to advancing a purpose-led vision and fostering a culture that encourages our employees to enhance our business and the communities in which we operate. We endeavor to integrate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices that create sustainable economic value to our employees, stockholders, communities, and other stakeholders. Our dedicated environmental and community stewardship is an integral component of our delivering excellence, driving strategic innovation, and growing long-term stockholder value. We believe that our impact on the environment, how we manage our relationships with employees, suppliers, customers and the communities where we operate, and the accountability of our leadership to our stockholders are all critically important to our business. We have undertaken a number of initiatives to further these goals, including establishment of a diversity and inclusion council, implementation of a human rights policy and continued collaboration with local communities to support COVID-19 testing and vaccination programs. 
With respect to environmental initiatives, we place a high priority on energy management, water conservation, and waste reduction. We are enhancing our water reclamation initiatives and continue to prioritize recyclable or biodegradable products in both our operations and our supply chain. We also continue to seek to incorporate solar power into our operations and otherwise reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.
With respect to governance issues, we are dedicated to meeting the highest standards of business conduct through our commitments to fostering quality and integrity in our own operations, and we expect our vendors to uphold the same standards of responsible business practices as set forth in our vendor code of conduct.

Human Capital
Our vision to be the preferred regional destination for entertainment would not be possible without our employees, who are the cornerstone of our commitment to provide the best customer experience for our guests.
We aim to create a culture that is results-oriented and supports our values of safety, integrity, accountability, guest-centricity, innovation, teamwork, inclusiveness, and fun. Core to achieving this goal is our commitment to conducting business in a manner that respects all individuals and promotes human rights, including providing fair working conditions and competitive wages, as set forth in our Human Rights Policy.
We believe that the Company’s success will be realized through the engagement and empowerment of our employees. We are focused on developing a dynamic performance-driven culture centered on the guest and creating a spirit of innovation, which has always been at our core.
Employees
As of January 1, 2023, we employed approximately 1,450 full-time employees, and over the course of the 2022 operating season we employed approximately 40,000 seasonal employees. We compete with other local employers for qualified candidates on a season-by-season basis. As part of the seasonal employment program, we employ a significant number of teenagers, which subjects us to child labor laws.
Approximately 20% of our domestic full-time and approximately 7% of our domestic seasonal employees are subject to labor agreements with local chapters of national unions. Approximately 4% of our international full-time and approximately 46% of our international seasonal employees are subject to labor agreements with local chapters of national unions. These labor agreements expire in January 2024 (Six Flags Over Texas), December 2024 (Six Flags Over Georgia and Six Flags Magic Mountain), and January 2025 (Six Flags St. Louis). The labor agreements for La Ronde expire in various years ranging from December 2022 through December 2024. With respect to the La Ronde agreement that expired in December 2022, active discussions with the unions are currently underway. The labor agreements for Six Flags Great Adventure expire in various years ranging from December 2023 through December 2026. We consider our employee relations to be good.

10



During the year ended January 1, 2023, we reduced full-time employee headcount by 520 from our total as of January 2, 2022. The reduction in full-time employees was done to right-size our organization for intentionally lower attendance levels and to create a more streamlined and efficient organization by reducing layers of management and empowering our workers. 
Diversity and Inclusion
We understand that enhancing our financial strength and improving our guest’s experience requires a diverse and inclusive workforce. We are committed to creating an inclusive environment that fully embraces the diversity of our employees and guests, regardless of ethnicity, gender, age, disability, cultural background, sexual orientation, or religious beliefs. We maintain a Diversity and Inclusion Council that provides feedback on a wide variety of diversity and inclusion related issues. In that regard, we are focused on the following:

Listen | to employees and other stakeholders about how we can become more diverse and inclusive through our Diversity and Inclusion Council, and through regular employee surveys, which provide feedback directly to senior management, including the CEO
Train | leaders on how to embrace inclusion, create awareness, understanding and recognize explicit and implicit bias including by providing instruction on how to lead open and honest conversations with employees 
Address Unconscious Biases | by updating our grooming, social media, and hiring policies, and changing any ride or attraction names that could be viewed as offensive 
Build a Diverse Team | with a leadership team that represents the diversity of our workplace and marketplace and through updating recruiting, people planning, and talent management programs to foster more objective processes for all employees 
Partner with Communities | by proactively working with diversity driven suppliers to develop long-term alliances. 

​
As of January 1, 2023, approximately 50% of our full-time management employees, defined as those holding the title of manager or higher, were diverse by ethnicity and/or gender. Of the group, 33% are female and approximately 28% are ethnically diverse.  By fostering an inclusive culture, we enable every employee to leverage unique talents and high-performance standards to drive innovation and success.
​
Employee Development
​
We seek to continuously elevate employee development and training through a variety of programs, opportunities, and resources. We continue to partner with the International Board of Credentialing and Continuing Education Standards to provide our guest-facing employees with specialized training to earn a Certificate in Autism Competency to further our commitment to better serve the special needs community, provide a more inclusive environment in our parks and continue our efforts in educating our employees on diversity and inclusion. We continue to enhance our talent development program by providing our employees with access to training, including virtual classrooms and online courses on topics including general safety, Office 365, harassment, discrimination, business ethics, anti-corruption, privacy and security, and park safety. We continue to redefine our succession planning process by establishing programs to better support the development of our talent bench for roles in management, maintenance and operations. Our senior leadership team reviews our talent development program annually with a particular focus on our top 10% of high performing, high potential talent, including a focus on diversity. We are committed to identifying and developing the talents of our future leaders. 
​
In 2022 we launched an educational platform called Workforce Edge that provides educational opportunities to all of our employees. These educational opportunities include degrees, certification, licensing, and leadership opportunities.

​
Employee Engagement and Recruitment
​
We understand that continuous engagement with our employees is vital to driving successful, meaningful outcomes. Senior management conducts “town-hall” style meetings with employees to address topics such as business operations, strategy, market conditions, and question-and-answer sessions, to foster an environment and corporate culture of transparency and collaboration. We conduct ongoing employee satisfaction surveys that provide actionable feedback from employees to management. The survey responses are anonymous and measure employee satisfaction and solicit honest feedback. Management from both corporate and the parks meet routinely to review the survey results and develop action plans in response to the employee feedback.
​
We are focused on attracting, developing, and retaining best-in-class diverse teams, and continuing to build an inclusive culture that inspires leadership, encourages innovative thinking, empowers expeditious decision-making, and ties to our values. These guiding principles have been more important than ever in light of the unique challenges of operating during the ongoing pandemic. We source candidates from various sources in order to meet the current and future demands of our business. We have established relationships with high schools, trade schools, universities, professional associations and industry partners to proactively attract new talent.
​
Our recruiting practices and candidate selection are among our most important activities. We prioritized filling open positions with quality employees who want to advance the Six Flags’ mission. In addition, we utilize social media, virtual job fairs and organizations across the United States to find diverse, enthusiastic and qualified employees. 
​
Competitive Benefits
​
Attracting, motivating, developing and retaining the best people is crucial to all aspects of our business and long-term success, and is central to our mission, vision and values. Our compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of our employees with our performance and to provide the proper incentives to attract, motivate and retain employees to achieve superior results. The structure of our compensation programs includes incentives based on both short-term and long-term performance. Specifically:

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Safety
The health and safety of our guests and employees is our highest priority. It is the shared responsibility of every employee to actively participate in creating a safe and secure environment and to minimize injuries. The hallmarks of the Company’s safety and security programs are:

12



​

● | Resources and education to ensure safe and secure operating environments at the parks, including compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards, as well as to improve overall workplace safety and health. This includes regular and ongoing safety training and assessments as well as annual safety audits.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | A highly trained workforce that proactively assesses risks, strives to eliminate unsafe conditions, and integrates learning from incidents to prevent future occurrences.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Dedicated leadership, accountability, and employee empowerment.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

​
We expanded remote work opportunities where possible and implemented extensive health and safety measures, such as enhanced sanitization protocols and distribution of personal protective equipment, to provide a safe working environment for our employees. We continue to regularly monitor guidance from federal and local health authorities in evaluating applicable COVID-19 health and safety protocols with regard to ongoing operations. We enhanced our operations to make it safer and easier for our employees to come to work including adding training to ensure compliance with applicable health and safety protocols, contactless recruiting and hiring procedures, and offering voluntary on-site COVID testing and vaccination opportunities. We received favorable responses from our employees on our safety measures as evidenced by our employee satisfaction scores. 
We continue to offer guests the ability to obtain cash cards from kiosks throughout the parks to facilitate electronic transactions as an option in lieu of using cash, and implemented mobile food ordering at all of our domestic parks. These innovations added contactless means to enhance our guests’ experience through faster, more convenient transactions while elevating our enhanced safety guidelines.
Human Rights
Our attention to health and safety of our guests and employees extends to the workers and communities in the supply chain. We believe that respect for human rights is fundamental to our mission of creating fun and thrilling memories for all and our commitment to ethical business conduct. We adopted a human rights policy that is grounded in international standards and is an important expression of our values. The policy provides the framework to hold employees accountable to advance, support and respect human rights in the course of doing business. We are focused on screening and doing business with vendors and suppliers who conduct their business with ethical standards that are consistent with our policy and the Company’s code of vendor conduct.
