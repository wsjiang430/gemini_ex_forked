ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
Corporate History

We were incorporated as Freeze Tag, Inc. in February 2006 in the State of Delaware. In March 2006, Freeze Tag, LLC, our predecessor which was formed in October 2005, was merged with and into Freeze Tag, Inc. In October of 2017, we completed a merger transaction with Munzee Inc. in a transaction in which Freeze Tag, Inc. became the surviving entity and both companies merged their operations together (the “Merger”). Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the Merger is treated as a “reverse merger” under the purchase method of accounting, with Munzee as the accounting acquirer. Accordingly, Munzee’s historical financial results of operations replace Freeze Tag’s historical financial results of operations for all periods prior to the Merger and, for all periods following the Merger, our financial statements include the financial results of operations of the combined company. The consolidated entity maintains office addresses in Tustin, California and McKinney, Texas. Other corporate actions that occurred as a result of the merger are that Robert Vardeman, Jr., former CEO of Munzee Inc. became President of Freeze Tag, Inc. and both Robert Vardeman, Jr. and Robert D. Vardeman were added to the Freeze Tag, Inc. Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors currently consists of Craig Holland, Mick Donahoo, Robert Vardeman, Jr., and Robert D. Vardeman. In the quarter ended March 31, 2020, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Space Coast Geo Store, LLC, a Florida limited liability company, began selling merchandise to the geocaching industry, and its financial results are consolidated in our financial statements.
Business Overview

Freeze Tag, Inc. is a creator of location-based, mobile social games that are fun and engaging for consumers and businesses. Based on a free-to-play business model that has propelled games built and marketed by some of our competitors to worldwide success, we employ state-of-the-art data analytics and proprietary technology to dynamically optimize the gaming experience for revenue generation. Players can download and enjoy our games for free, and, if they so choose, they can purchase virtual items and additional features within the game to increase the fun factor.

Founded by gaming industry veterans, Freeze Tag has launched several successful games over the course of its history. Our current portfolio includes hits such as Munzee®, a social platform with over 10 million locations worldwide and hundreds of thousands of players that blends gamification and geolocation into an experience that rewards players for going places in the physical world, WallaBee®, an addictive collecting game with over 2,000 beautifully drawn digital cards, as well as many social mobile games that provide endless hours of family-friendly fun. We also offer our technology and services to third party businesses that want to leverage mobile gaming in their marketing and branding programs. For example, our Eventzee® solution allows businesses to create private scavenger hunts in physical places such as malls, tradeshows, company events or campuses to create immersive brand experiences.

Our mission is to design, develop and deliver innovative digital entertainment that surprises and delights. Our products bring families together by providing fun to kids of all ages. We also strive to create a workplace environment where creativity and fun can thrive in a demanding industry.

Throughout 2022, we made progress on several objectives including continued development of our Munzee product offering, the expansion of our Eventzee custom scavenger hunt platform, and the ongoing creation of a new location-based application. 

Munzee Development and Live Operations

Munzee continues to be our flagship product. In 2022, several new features were added to our Munzee app including: 


- | Introduced new Daily Activity Tracker that helps players keep up their streaks and rewards them for consecutive daily and monthly gameplay activity. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- | Introduced ability to create In-App Map Links, which allows players to share the location of a specific Munzee or anywhere on the map to ask for deploys, setup trades and more
- | Google Fit updates to allow players to continue to sync and track their walking activity 
- | Added 5 new filter presets for Premium players to allow for more customization 
- | Updated activity notifications to show how many CapOn points the player earned when other players capture their Munzees 


We also increased our marketing efforts and expanded to new user acquisition sources to help grow and expand our customer base across the world.

Eventzee Development and Expanded Customer Base

During 2022, we started the design and development process on a whole new admin interface for our Eventzee clients. When completed, our clients will have several new features and capabilities available to them including: 

- | The ability to create their own events and experience Eventzee with a limited number of users before purchasing a full event package
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- | Access to a library of hundreds of pre-made challenges that have been successfully implemented in dozens of Eventzee events 
- | A new challenge type, which will bring the total to 8 challenge options, the most of any scavenger hunt app on the market 
- | Two levels of admins authorization 
- | And many more features requested by clients 


We plan on launching the new admin tool in Q2 of 2023.

The Eventzee team also continued to add and service high profile clients such as the Monumental Sports, (owners of Capital One Arena, the Washington Wizards and Capitals pro sports teams), Baha Mar, a large luxury resort located in the Bahamas, and continuing clients DTLA (downtown Los Angeles BID) and Miami Zoo. 

New App for Painted Rocks Hobbyists 

For enthusiasts who paint and hide rocks for others to find, it is difficult to track the activity of your rock. Painted rock creators want to know who found their rocks, how they reacted when they found it, and whether they kept the rock or re-hid it for others to find. Our new Painted Rocks App (PRA) manages all these functions and more. The Painted Rocks App also offers a Rock Locator Map that players can use to find painted rocks hidden in the wild. 

We beta launched the Painted Rocks App in 2022 to build an organic audience and receive feedback on the app’s features and benefits. In 2023, we are planning on continuing development to implement changes requested by early users and embark on an ad campaign to grow the PRA player base and formally launch the app. 

Our Goals for 2023 and Beyond

As we look ahead to 2023, we plan to expand our topline revenue and profit.

We plan to continue expanding our Munzee player base both in the United States and internationally. Our Munzee app development roadmap calls for adding features that will engage players of all ages and should help us expand our player base. 

In addition, our Eventzee app has shown consecutive year over year revenue growth. During 2023, we will add resources, both in terms of people and promotion, to the Eventzee platform to continue and accelerate the upward growth trajectory.

The market opportunity for Eventzee services is large with potential clients in a wide array of industries and applications, including cities, tourism centers, parks and zoos, educational institutions, brands and marketing organizations, companies looking for team building tools, and many more. For more information, we refer you to the Eventzee web site: www.eventzeeapp.com. 

Since our Painted Rocks App is just concluding its beta phase, 2023 is the year we plan to build an audience and engage with painted rocks enthusiasts across the world. 

Business Strategy

In recent years, we have shifted our business strategy to focus our efforts on creating free-to-play (FTP) social games for the mobile market. We’ve made this change because we believe that games that are social and mobile will provide the greatest revenue opportunities now and in the foreseeable future. This change in direction has not been an easy one as we’ve had to deploy resources differently, learn new techniques, and experiment with new game designs and marketing processes. As we realize success with profitable free-to-play games like Munzee and WallaBee, we are realizing dividends from the many hours invested in learning, experimenting and testing FTP game mechanics and marketing techniques. 

We have also announced our intention to grow through acquisition. The merger with Munzee Inc. is evidence that we are making progress on our intention to grow the business through merging and/or acquiring other companies in our field. During 2022, we continued to focus a great deal of effort on building a successful multi-office and multi-state team, developing communications, reporting, and working relationships to integrate all of the Freeze Tag employees and contractors into a cohesive, thriving worldwide team, and we believe that we are seeing the benefits of those efforts.

We still feel that the time is right to build an alliance of mobile game developers who can become stronger and more successful by working together to build a company that can leverage market intelligence, development expertise and cross-promotional opportunities to achieve great results for our customers and shareholders. 

During 2023 and beyond, we will continue to look for acquisition candidates and propose transactions in cases where it makes sense for both parties and will enhance the value of the company. 

In the event we do enter into any such transactions in the future, such transactions will likely be accomplished through the issuance of shares of our stock and/or in connection with a strategic financial investor, and not with cash directly from us unless and until our cash position improves.

Free-to-play Business Model

The free-to-play business model for games was pioneered on the PC platform and has exploded globally on the mobile platform. The free-to-play model allows users to download and play an enjoyable, but limited, portion of a game for free. If the user wants to access premium features or special virtual items to increase the fun factor, then the user is required to pay, usually $0.99 per feature or item or $0.99 for a bundle of virtual items. For example, if a player has run out of “lives” or “moves” in a game, the player is given two options: 1) Wait for the lives to re-charge which involves waiting but no expense of money or virtual currency; 2) Spend money or virtual currency to buy additional “lives” and keep playing immediately.

With the exception of the Eventzee platform, we adhere to the “free-to-play” business model in our currently live Freeze Tag games. In Munzee, players can purchase blast caps to capture virtual munzees deployed near them. WallaBee also offers players a chance to “forage” for honeycombs for free or they may be purchased as in-game items. In all cases, Munzee, WallaBee and some of our other games are games that players can and do play for free, yet by spending money on additional items, the gameplay experience is enhanced. 

Over the last several years, the free-to-play business model has proven to be a very successful model for mobile games. The revenue potential of a game largely depends on the fun-factor and popularity of the game and the game creator’s proprietary techniques for encouraging the player to make a purchase decision – without overly offending the player. The potential for rapidly spreading the game through social networks and small in-game purchases can add up to a very sizeable business opportunity, as evidenced by many mobile games generating millions and even billions of dollars based solely on an accumulation of players making many individual item purchases. 

Going forward, we plan on the majority of Freeze Tag’s mobile games to be based on the free-to-play model. In addition, we believe that games are more fun with friends, so we connect our players with major social networks such as Facebook and Twitter to enhance the games’ addictiveness, enjoyment and world-of-mouth referrals. We also offer ways for players to communicate directly with each other in Munzee and WallaBee to enhance the feeling of community and comradery. In both Munzee and WallaBee mobile apps, there are certain aspects of gameplay that are more enjoyable when the experience is shared with other players. 

Since mobile app development technology is constantly changing and evolving, we review and research platforms, tools, techniques, and third-party SDK’s on a routine basis to ensure we are in synch with the market. In executing our business model, we have derived the most benefit from employing proprietary game engine(s) built on commonly used technologies (like Cordova, HTML5, and others) because using our own tools and techniques allows us to be nimble and anticipate market changes. 

In the future, we plan to continue to employ our game engine(s). This approach allows us to find the best development teams, engineering teams, and partners to help us quickly deploy our games.

The Freeze Tag Strategy

In targeting the global market for mobile games, we are highly focused on developing mobile social games that are casual, fun and engaging for all ages and genders. The free-to-play business model combined with the use of best-in-class development environments and Analytics and Deployment tools, allows us to systematically launch, optimize and monetize our games. We design our games to be never ending entertainment that our users will enjoy playing and be willing to pay us $0.99 or more from time-to-time for special features and virtual items to keep having fun. We believe that the free-to-play model should not be run as a sprint but rather as a marathon. Over the span of several months, or even years, each game is continuously subject to this optimization process to increase user enjoyment and financial return to the company.
Distribution and Marketing

We market, sell and distribute our games primarily through direct-to-consumer digital storefronts, such as Apple’s App Store, the Google Play Store and. We also sell to our players directly through our own web site http://www.freezetag.com and https://store.freezetag.com. We work with payment vendors like Shopify, Square and PayPal to process our online payments. In addition to publishing our smartphone games on direct-to-consumer digital storefronts, we also publish some of our titles on other platforms, such as the Facebook App Store, the Mac App Store and PC Download portals such as Big Fish Games and others.  Our focus for growth is with the direct-to-consumer digital storefronts, and revenues for the other platforms (Facebook app store, Mac App Store, and PC Download portals) have diminished in recent years, as we have not focused on them.

User Acquisition 

In the free-to-play business model, a constant stream of new players is necessary to be successful. So, we have partnered with advertising networks and lead generation companies such as Facebook and Google to help us reach the appropriate audience for our products. We also employ data analytics to determine which creative messages and which lead referral sources are bringing in the most players who spend money in our games. 

To help reduce the cost of acquiring downloads, we have embedded social networking mechanisms into our games to enable our best customers to do the marketing for us. Every time a satisfied player invites her friend to play one of our games, we have been introduced to a new potential customer without incurring a cost to entice that player to download the game. We will continue to design methods to encourage our players to invite their friends and spread the word about our games. Each time a user downloads one of our games from a friend referral without a direct expense from us, our user acquisition cost is lower, and therefore our profitability is potentially higher. 

Technology and Tools

Free-to-play Revenue Model

The game industry, like many other forms of entertainment (music, TV, books, etc.) has undergone a major shift. The free-to-play business model has increased in appeal to game players of every genre and platform. Nowhere has this been felt more deeply than the mobile market. Free is a very powerful marketing approach that is irresistible to game players. The top grossing charts on popular mobile app stores like Apple, Google, and Amazon continually show that “free” games earn the most revenue for their developers. So, with all this “free-ness,” how does a game creator make any money?
Optimizing Customer Lifetime Value

The key business metric of any free-to-play game is the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV). A free-to-play gamer starts out as a zero-revenue customer, but he or she may become a paying customer throughout the customer’s life of playing the game. The game creator’s business is an ongoing engagement with the game players to get them to buy things in the game, without ruining the fun. Optimizing this delicate balance is where the most revenue can be extracted.

This combination allows us to optimize the features of our games to refresh and update the content so that players are happily engaged and invite their friends to play with them. When players invite their friends, they lower our user acquisition costs. The longer and more often players come back to play, the more likely they are to spend money on virtual goods (through in-game purchases). The net result is a customer with a greater lifetime value. The happier customers are, the more they share with their friends and the more often they come back to spend money. Everything we do is geared to our players having more fun because ultimately customer fun translates into revenue.

Data Analytics

By using commercial and proprietary data analytics tools, we analyze various aspects of the game across the entire pool of players to determine what modifications can be made to the game, which allows us to: (1) make it more fun, and (2) induce a purchase.

7


Some of the analysis we perform regularly are:


· | Analyze the number of users that complete the tutorial process 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Identify the Day 1, Day 7, and Day 30 retention metrics of how many players are returning to play 
· | Quantify the ARPDAU (average revenue per daily active user) to determine the monetization effectiveness of each game 
· | Determine the percentage of overall users that are converting to spenders 
· | Quantify the ARPPDAU (average revenue per paying daily active user) 
· | Determine what parts of the game users are playing most 
· | Identify where in the game users are dropping out, and find out why 
· | Average play time per day and per session 
· | Importance of social networks, like Facebook and Twitter, to the game and how many players login to social networks 
· | Identify what events most correlate with purchase events 
· | Identify how many invites a user is sending out, how long it takes them to send the first invite out, and how many of those players are coming in.

Dynamic Game Engine(s)

Over the years, we have developed proprietary dynamic game engine(s) (Freeze Tag Game Engine(s)) that allows us to make changes to game play and game economies on-the-fly, in most cases, without requiring the download of another update. We also integrate several business analytics packages, and other key game management tools into our games that provide us with real time data to measure detailed player behavior, and respond directly to that behavior. We continue to develop and enhance our own Game Engine(s) which use web-friendly technology that can be easily ported to the most popular mobile platforms, iOS and Android. As our games have become more sophisticated with the need for constant data connection and several points of data required to be associated with physical locations on a map, we have developed server-side tools to handle these requirements. 

Over the years, the Freeze Tag Game Engine(s) have allowed us the ability to port across multiple platforms using a single codebase. We continue to look to contract with outside teams and outside contractors, allowing us to maintain a smaller internal team. 

As we continue our development efforts, our approach is to review the technical requirements of the game we want to develop, then make a decision as to which Game Engine is the most appropriate to implement for that development effort, whether that be our own proprietary game engine based on web technologies or third-party platforms such as Unity 3D. 

As we make decisions about which Game Engine to employ, here are a few of the things that we look to have:


· | A single codebase that can be easily ported to other platforms 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Ability to “bolt on” other technologies and codes to easily integrate with other SDK’s, platforms and special needs
· | Interface easily with scalable backend databases and architecture 
· | Easily localized into new languages 
· | Updates can be pushed to the game allowing us to change things like: 


o | adding new characters 
--+---------------------------------------------
o | changing the values in the economy 
o | updating text 
o | messaging users (in game) about new features
o | instigating a social network-based contest

Integrated Feedback Mechanisms

In addition, we aim to integrate feedback mechanisms into our games to provide incentive for our players to communicate their favorite features and any technical difficulties they may be experiencing. By combining dynamic gaming technology and data analytics into one integrated business process, we can optimize the “fun” factor for our players and maximize our revenue potential.
Product Development

We have learned that establishing and following a fairly rigid process is essential to producing commercially successful products, regardless of the platform. The process all begins with the creative development process. The chart below describes the approach we use to filter ideas and make final decisions on which games we will actually produce. After choosing the game that we will focus on, we write a detailed design document. A thorough design document ensures that all of those involved in the creation of the game have a common reference source throughout the production process. Also, critical to producing high quality games, a test plan accompanies every design document. Not only do we test for bugs, but also we test the game for usability. Since most casual gamers do not want to read instructions, it is critical that the finished game be easy to play by just tapping at objects on the screen. 


As a developer of mobile social games, we have developed expertise in three core aspects of game production. These core competencies help to give us a competitive advantage in the industry. They are listed below, with the resulting benefit also identified.


1. | Create High Quality Products (including art and sound assets). Benefit: Provides high value to distribution partners and consumers, resulting in increased downloads and purchases.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


9


2. | Maintain Flexible Engineering Tools and Processes. Benefit: Decreases time-to-market delivery of products. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. | Minimize Risk by doing the following: 1) selecting proven genres, 2) keeping development costs low, and 3) modifying designs “on the fly” based on consumer feedback. Benefit: Increases the number of games released per year and decreases reliance on any one title’s success, ultimately improving return on investment for each game.

Competition

The business of mobile games is very competitive. New products are introduced frequently and the platforms and devices change rapidly. To be successful in this crowded marketplace, we have to entice consumers to play our games based on the quality and “fun” of the experience. Players evaluate our games based on the game play, graphics quality, the music and sound effects and the efficiency and clarity of our software engineering and user interface design. 

We compete with a continually increasing number of successful location-based mobile game companies, including Niantic (makers of Pokemon Go), Geocaching, and many others. 

In addition, given the open nature of the development and distribution for mobile devices, we also compete or will compete with a vast number of small companies and individuals who are able to create and launch games and other content for these devices using relatively limited resources and with relatively limited start-up time or expertise. 

Some of our competitors and our potential competitors have one or more advantages over us, either globally or in particular geographic markets, which include:


· | significantly greater financial resources; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | greater experience with the free-to-play games and games-as-a-service (GAAS) business models and more effective game monetization; 
· | stronger brand and consumer recognition regionally or worldwide; 
· | greater experience and effectiveness integrating community features into their games and increasing the revenues derived from their users; 
· | larger installed customer bases from their existing mobile games; 
· | the capacity to leverage their marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of mobile and non-mobile products; 
· | larger installed customer bases from related platforms, such as console gaming or social networking websites, to which they can market and sell mobile games;
· | more substantial intellectual property of their own from which they can develop games without having to pay royalties; 
· | better overall economies of scale; 
· | greater platform-specific focus, experience and expertise; and 
· | broader global distribution and presence. 

Intellectual Property

Our intellectual property is an essential element of our business. We use a combination of trademark, patent, copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, confidentiality agreements and license agreements to protect our intellectual property. We have also registered a number of domain names, which we believe will be important to the branding and success of our games. Our employees and independent contractors are required to sign agreements acknowledging that all inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments and other processes generated by them on our behalf are our property, and assigning to us any ownership that they may claim in those works. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use without consent intellectual property that we own or license. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties, and the expenses incurred in protecting our intellectual property rights, may adversely affect our business. 

10


We intend to register ownership of software copyrights in the United States as well as seek registration of various trademarks associated with the Company’s name and mobile social games that we will develop. 

Wherever possible, we own registered trademark protection for properties we develop. As the digital markets evolve, there are and will continue to be many competitors who will imitate successful game properties. We are investing in trademark protection to create game brands and protect them. For example, we have received approval from the United States Patent and Trademark Office to register Unsolved Mystery®, Unsolved Mystery Club®, Ancient Astronauts®, Victorian Mysteries®, Grimm Reaper® and Rocket Weasel® for all gaming platforms. Munzee Inc. has previously received approval for the trademarks Munzee®, Eventzee®, and WallaBee®. These marks will assist us in defending against copycats who may try to incorporate these terms into their game titles. 

From time to time, we may encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. While we believe that our product and service offerings do not infringe the intellectual property rights of any third party, we cannot be assured that we will prevail in any intellectual property dispute. If we do not prevail in such disputes, we may lose some or all of our intellectual property protection, be enjoined from further sales of the applications determined to infringe the rights of others, and/or be forced to pay substantial royalties to a third party.

Business Acquisitions 

In addition to our current operations, we propose to seek, investigate and, if warranted, acquire an interest in one or more businesses. The merger with Munzee Inc. is evidence of our pursuit of this strategy. We propose to investigate potential opportunities, particularly focusing upon existing privately held businesses whose owners are willing to consider merging their businesses into our company in order to establish a public trading market for their common stock, and whose managements are willing to operate the acquired businesses as divisions or subsidiaries of our company. The businesses we acquire may or may not need an injection of cash to facilitate their future operations. Presently, if we acquire any businesses, we envision such acquisition being completed either with our shares of our stock or with the assistance of a strategic funding partner. We currently do not have substantial funds, or a revenue stream, to make acquisitions utilizing cash.

We are primarily interested in other technology opportunities, but we currently do not intend to restrict our search for investment opportunities to any particular industry or geographical location and may, therefore, engage in essentially any business. Our executive officers will review material furnished to them by the proposed merger or acquisition candidates and will ultimately decide if a merger or acquisition is in our best interests and the interests of our shareholders. We intend to source business opportunities through our officers and directors and their contacts. Those contacts include professional advisors such as attorneys and accountants, securities broker dealers, venture capitalists, members of the financial community, other businesses and others who may present solicited and unsolicited proposals. Management believes that business opportunities and ventures may become available to it due to a number of factors, including, among others: (1) management’s willingness to consider a wide variety of businesses; (2) management’s contacts and acquaintances; and (3) our flexibility with respect to the manner in which we may be able to structure, finance, merge with or acquire any business opportunity.

The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of our executive officers and directors. Inasmuch as we will have limited funds available to search for business opportunities and ventures, we will not be able to expend significant funds on a complete and exhaustive investigation of such business or opportunity. We will, however, investigate, to the extent believed reasonable by our management, such potential business opportunities or ventures by conducting a so-called “due diligence investigation”.


11


In a so-called “due diligence investigation,” we intend to obtain and review materials regarding the business opportunity. Typically, such materials will include information regarding a target business’ products, services, contracts, management, ownership, and financial information. In addition, we intend to cause our officers or agents to meet personally with management and key personnel of target businesses, ask questions regarding our prospects, tour facilities, and conduct other reasonable investigation of the target business to the extent of our limited financial resources and management and technical expertise.

Government Regulation

Because of our development of Augmented Reality/Geolocation games, and the types of data that we collect in those games, we must be more mindful of government regulations regarding the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act or COPPA. To protect minors on the Internet (and now mobile devices), U.S. officials passed The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Essentially, COPPA governs online data collection of people aged 13 and younger. The COPPA rules define privacy policy requirements, data collection parameters, and the process of acquiring verifiable parental consent. In the past, we have disclosed the information that we collect in Privacy Policies, but now need to focus on getting parental approval for certain types of applications as they relate to children under the age of 13.
Our Employees

We have 12 employees, with the majority of them based in either the Tustin, California area, or the McKinney, Texas area, with several in other remote locations throughout the world. Four of these are managers, one is administrative staff, and the remaining seven are artists, engineers, production staff, etc. We also work with several other independent contractors including artists, engineers, and designers, on an as-needed basis. 
Human Capital Resources

As noted above, we only have a small number of employees. The remainder of our workforce is consultants due to the nature of our business. As it relates to our employees and the consultants that work with us:
Oversight and Management

Our executive officers are tasked with leading our organization in managing employment-related matters, including recruiting and hiring, onboarding and training, compensation planning, talent management and development. We are committed to providing team members with the training and resources necessary to continually strengthen their skills. Our executive team is responsible for periodically reviewing team member programs and initiatives, including healthcare and other benefits, as well as our management development and succession planning practices. Management periodically reports to the Board regarding our human capital measures and results that guide how we attract, retain and develop a workforce to enable our business strategies.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

We believe that a diverse workforce is critical to our success, and we continue to monitor and improve the application of our hiring, retention, compensation and advancement processes for women and underrepresented populations across our workforce, including persons of color, veterans and LGBTQ to enhance our inclusive and diverse culture. We continue to invest in recruiting diverse talent.

12

Workplace Safety and Health

A vital part of our business is providing our workforce with a safe, healthy and sustainable working environment. We focus on implementing change through workforce observation and feedback channels to recognize risk and continuously improve our processes.

Importantly during 2020 and 2021, our focus on providing a positive work environment and on workplace safety enabled us to preserve business continuity without sacrificing our commitment to keeping our colleagues and workplace visitors safe during the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic we took immediate action to enact safety protocols in our facilities by improving sanitation measures, implementing mandatory social distancing, requiring the use of face coverings, reducing on-site workforce through staggered shifts and schedules, permitting remote working for most employees, and restricting visitor access to our locations. These actions helped minimize the impact of COVID-19 on our workforce.

Description of Property

In November of 2022, we closed our physical office space, and now maintain an executive office address in Tustin, California, at 360 E 1st Street, #450, Tustin, CA 92780, at a rate of $120 per year. During 2022, we leased a production office in Texas located at 201 ½ E. Virginia, Suite 8, McKinney, TX 75069.  We were on a one-year lease at monthly lease payment of $600.  This lease ended December 2022. Effective, January 15, 2023, we closed that facility.  As a result, we began outsourcing our physical production.  However, we still maintain an office mailing address in McKinney, Texas.
