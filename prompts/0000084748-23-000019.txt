Company Background and Strategy
Rogers Corporation designs, develops, manufactures and sells high-performance and high-reliability engineered materials and components to meet our customers’ demanding challenges. We operate two strategic operating segments: Advanced Electronics Solutions (AES) and Elastomeric Material Solutions (EMS). The remaining operations, which represent our non-core businesses, are reported in our Other operating segment. We have a history of innovation and have established Innovation Centers for our research and development (R&D) activities in Chandler, Arizona; Burlington, Massachusetts; Eschenbach, Germany; and Suzhou, China. We are headquartered in Chandler, Arizona.
Our growth and profitability strategy is based upon the following principles: (1) market-driven organization, (2) innovation leadership, (3) synergistic mergers and acquisitions, and (4) operational excellence. Our priorities in executing this strategy are focused on driving near-term improvements to profitability and improving the growth outlook for the Company over the next several years by further strengthening our focus on commercial activities, expanding capacity to meet customer demand and driving innovation.
As a market-driven organization, we are focused on capitalizing on growth opportunities in the increasing electrification of vehicles, including electric and hybrid electric vehicles (EV/HEV), and increasing use of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) in the automotive industry, the advancement of communication systems in aerospace and defense and the growth of 5G smartphones in the portable electronics industry. In addition to our focus on these markets, we sell into a variety of other markets including general industrial, clean energy, wireless infrastructure and mass transit.
Our sales and marketing approach is based on addressing these trends, while our strategy focuses on factors for success as a manufacturer of engineered materials and components: performance, reliability, technical service capabilities, cost, efficiency, innovation and technology. Through this strategy we expect to be able to drive further commercial wins, which provide the potential for higher growth in the future. We have also expanded our capabilities through organic investment and acquisitions and strive to ensure high quality solutions for our customers.
Our operational excellence efforts are focused on driving significant near-term improvement in our profitability. These efforts include focusing on adding strategic new hires and improving processes and tools to achieve better performance. We have also taken specific cost improvement actions in the fourth quarter of 2022 and first quarter of 2023 that will benefit subsequent quarters. These actions include optimizing our manufacturing footprint, divesting non-core product lines and reduction to manufacturing and corporate employees. We continue to review and re-align our manufacturing and engineering footprint in an effort to maintain a leading competitive position globally and to support our customers’ growth initiatives.
We seek to enhance our operational and financial performance by investing in research and development, manufacturing and materials efficiencies, and new product initiatives that respond to the needs of our customers. We strive to evaluate operational and strategic alternatives to improve our business structure and align our business with the changing needs of our customers and major industry trends affecting our business.
If we are able to successfully execute on our strategy, we see an opportunity to return to historical levels of profitability and accelerate revenue growth, relative to 2022, over the next several years, led by organic growth and complemented by targeted acquisitions. This outlook is supported by our participation in a number of fast-growing markets and by our strong competitive positions in these markets. The fastest growing market opportunity is expected to be EV/HEV where third-party analysis projects that the market will grow at compound annual growth rate of more than 25% over the next several years. Within the EV/HEV market, we believe our advanced battery cell pads, ceramic substrates and power interconnects provide multiple content opportunities to capitalize on this growth. In each of these areas we have secured a number of design wins and have a strong pipeline, which provides confidence in our growth outlook. Other markets with a strong growth trajectory include ADAS, aerospace and defense, clean energy and portable electronics. Each of these markets is expected to contribute to our growth strategy.
Terminated Merger Agreement with DuPont
On November 1, 2021, we entered into a definitive merger agreement to be acquired by DuPont in an all-cash transaction at a price of $277.00 per share of the Company’s capital stock. The merger agreement provided for the acquisition of Rogers Corporation by DuPont through the merger of Cardinalis Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of DuPont, with and into Rogers Corporation, with Rogers Corporation surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of DuPont. Company shareholders approved the merger agreement at a special shareholder meeting held on January 25, 2022. The merger agreement provided both Rogers Corporation and DuPont with a right to terminate the merger agreement if the merger had not closed on or before November 1, 2022. Consummation of the merger was subject to various customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval by the State Administration for Market Regulation of China (SAMR). As of November 1, 2022, the parties had not received regulatory approval from SAMR. On November 1, 2022, the Company received from DuPont a notice of termination of the merger agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, the Company received a regulatory 
termination fee from DuPont in the amount of $162.5 million, before taxes, and incurred a transaction-related fee of $20.4 million.
COVID-19 Update
The global COVID-19 pandemic has affected and continues to affect Rogers’ business, operations and demand from customers with the emergence and spread of new variants of the virus. In response to the outbreak, Rogers prioritized the safety and well-being of its employees—including incentivizing vaccinations, implementing social distancing initiatives in its facilities, providing remote working arrangements for certain employees, expanding personal protective equipment usage, enhancing plant hygiene processes and extending employee benefits, while at the same time taking actions to preserve business continuity. Our non-manufacturing employees transitioned seamlessly to remote working arrangements and are effectively collaborating both internally and with our customers. Surges in COVID-19 cases in China resulted in lockdowns as well as various restrictions. These measures have not disrupted our manufacturing efforts, however, they are causing logistics challenges. Even since China ended its zero COVID policy in late 2022, although a significant percentage of our employees in Suzhou, China were diagnosed with COVID, our manufacturing was not materially disrupted and to date we have received no reports of permanent disability or death among our employees. We expect that the COVID-19 pandemic will have a continuing but uncertain impact on our business and operations in the short- and medium-term.
Operating Segments
Advanced Electronics Solutions
Our AES operating segment designs, develops, manufactures and sells circuit materials, ceramic substrate materials, busbars and cooling solutions for applications in EV/HEV, wireless infrastructure (i.e., power amplifiers, antennas and small cells), automotive (i.e., ADAS), telematics and thermal solutions, aerospace and defense (i.e., antenna systems, communication systems and phased array radar systems), mass transit, clean energy (i.e., variable frequency drives, renewable energy), connected devices (i.e., mobile internet devices and thermal solutions) and wired infrastructure (i.e., computing and internet protocol (IP) infrastructure) markets. We believe these materials have characteristics that offer performance and other functional advantages in many market applications, which serve to differentiate our products from other commonly available materials.

We believe these materials have characteristics that offer functional advantages in many market applications, which serve to differentiate our products from other commonly available materials. EMS products are sold globally to converters, fabricators, distributors and OEMs. Trade names for our EMS products include: PORON®, BISCO®, DeWAL®, ARLON®, eSorba®, XRD®, Silicone Engineering and R/bak®.
As of December 31, 2022, our EMS operating segment had manufacturing and administrative facilities in Rogers, Connecticut; Woodstock, Connecticut; Bear, Delaware; Carol Stream, Illinois; Narragansett, Rhode Island; Evergem, Belgium; Blackburn, England; Siheung, South Korea; and Suzhou, China. We also own 50% of two unconsolidated joint ventures: (1) Rogers Inoac Corporation (RIC), a joint venture established in Japan to design, develop, manufacture and sell PORON® products predominantly for the Japanese market and (2) Rogers INOAC Suzhou Corporation (RIS), a joint venture established in China to design, develop, manufacture and sell PORON® products primarily for RIC customers in various Asian countries. INOAC Corporation owns the remaining 50% of both RIC and RIS. RIC has manufacturing facilities at the INOAC facilities in Nagoya and Mie, Japan, and RIS has manufacturing facilities at Rogers’ facilities in Suzhou, China.
Other
Our Other operating segment consists of elastomer components for applications in the general industrial market, as well as elastomer floats for level sensing in fuel tanks, motors, and storage tanks applications in the general industrial and automotive 
markets. We sell our elastomer components under our ENDUR® trade name and our floats under our NITROPHYL® trade name.
Sales and Competition
We sell our materials and components primarily through direct sales channels positioned near major concentrations of our customers in North America, Europe and Asia. We sold to approximately 3,500 customers worldwide in 2022, primarily OEMs and component suppliers. No individual customer represented more than 10% of our total net sales for 2022; however, there are concentrations of OEM customers in our AES operating segment (semiconductor and automotive manufacturers). Although the loss of any one of our larger customers would require a period of adjustment, during which the results of operations could be materially adversely impacted, we believe that such events could be successfully mitigated over a period of time due to the diversity of our customer base.
We employ a technical sales and marketing approach pursuant to which we work collaboratively to provide design engineering, testing, product development and other technical support services to OEMs that incorporate our engineered materials and components in their products. Component suppliers convert, modify or otherwise incorporate our engineered materials and components into their components for these OEMs in accordance with their specifications. Accordingly, we provide similar technical support services to component suppliers.
We compete primarily with manufacturers of high-end materials, some of which are large, multi-national companies, principally on the basis of innovation, historical customer relationships, product quality, reliability, performance and price, technical and engineering service and support, breadth of product line, and manufacturing capabilities. We also compete with manufacturers of commodity materials, including smaller regional producers with lower overhead costs and profit requirements located in Asia that attempt to upsell their products based principally upon price, particularly for products that have matured in their life cycle. We believe that we have a competitive advantage because of our reputation for innovation, the performance, reliability and quality of our materials and components, and our commitment to technical support and customer service.
Our sales are generally pursuant to short-term purchase orders. These purchase orders are made without deposits and may be rescheduled, canceled or modified on relatively short notice, without substantial penalty. Therefore, even though we may have a large backlog from time to time, we believe the purchase orders or backlog are not necessarily a reliable indicator of future sales.
Research and Development
We have a history of innovation, and innovation leadership is a key component of our overall business strategy. The markets we serve are typically characterized by rapid technological changes and advances. Accordingly, the success of our strategy is in part dependent on our ability to develop market-leading products, which is primarily driven by efforts in R&D. We are focused on identifying technologies and innovations related to both our current product portfolio as well as initiatives targeted at further diversifying and growing our business. As part of this technology commitment, we have a Rogers Innovation Center co-located at Northeastern University in Burlington, Massachusetts, as well as Rogers Innovation Centers at our facilities in Chandler, Arizona; Eschenbach, Germany; and Suzhou, China. Our Innovation Centers focus on early stages of technical and commercial development of new high-tech materials solutions in an effort to align with market direction and needs.
Patents and Other Intellectual Property
We have many domestic and foreign patents, licenses and additional patent applications pending related to technology in each of our operating segments. These patents and licenses vary in duration and provide some protection from competition. We also own a number of registered and unregistered trademarks and have acquired and developed certain confidential and proprietary technologies, including trade secrets that we believe to be of some importance to our business.
While we believe our patents and other intellectual property provide a competitive advantage to our operating segments, we believe that a significant part of our competitive position and future success will be determined by factors such as the innovative skills, systems and process knowledge, and technological expertise of our personnel; the range of new products we develop; and our customer service and support.
Manufacturing and Raw Materials
The key raw materials used in our business are as follows: for our AES operating segment, copper, polymer, polytetraflouroethylene, fiberglass materials and ceramic and brazing paste materials, including silver; and for our EMS operating segment, polyol, isocyanates, polytetraflouroethylene, ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene materials and silicone materials.
Some of the raw materials used in our business are available through sole or limited-source suppliers. While we have undertaken strategies to mitigate the risks associated with sole or limited source suppliers, these strategies may not be effective in all cases, and price increases or disruptions in our supply of raw materials could have a material adverse impact on our business. For additional information, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Seasonality
Except for some minor seasonality for consumer products, which often aligns with year-end holidays and product launch cycles, the operations of our segments have not been seasonal.
Human Capital Management
The Company’s continuing success derives from our talented and dedicated employees globally, who are responsible for the innovation, operations and ethics foundational to our business and its future. In 2022, our employees navigated the challenges from COVID-19, and, with an overarching commitment to health and safety, maintained a steady flow of materials for our customers, including for critical infrastructure and health applications.
As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 3,800 people, of whom approximately 1,350 were employed in the U.S., 1,300 in Europe and 1,100 in China. Approximately 400 of our domestic employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or by specific labor agreements and approximately 800 of our European employees are covered by work council arrangements.
Our approach to human capital management is based on our culture of respect, which is built on the ethical foundation of our Code of Business Ethics and our commitment to making choices that are based on what is ethically sound and not just what is easy or expedient. Additionally, we connect our day-to-day work with our organizational objectives through our Cultural Behaviors: Live Safely, Trust, Just Decide, Speak Openly, Simply Improve, Innovate and Deliver Results. Management’s principal objectives, with oversight from our Board of Directors, are Health and Safety, Employee Experience and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.
Health and Safety
Promoting the health and safety of our employees is one of our most important objectives. We strive to minimize lost workdays and recordable incidents. To promote awareness and accountability, safety performance data is shared throughout the company and executive compensation includes safety performance factors.
As part of our efforts to promote employee safety related to COVID-19, we have taken a structured approach to control potential onsite exposures. We have global, regional and site-specific pandemic steering committees ensuring that policies and procedures are developed and implemented in accordance with recommendations put forth by the recognized health authorities in each part of the world in which we operate. All policy recommendations, new or changed, are reviewed and approved by our executive leadership team, ensuring timely communication to our employees prior to implementation.
We continue to follow the guidance issued by recognized authorities around the world and make adjustments to our global, regional, and local policies as necessary. The global committee will continue to meet regularly to provide guidance to our organization as circumstances evolve.
Employment Experience
We take a comprehensive approach to the employment experience, striving to use a fair and inclusive recruiting process to select talented individuals. Once we hire, we endeavor to provide our employees a safe and ethical work environment that includes fair compensation, opportunities for career development and employee engagement. We are proud to invest in our employees’ futures through a variety of technical and other training opportunities internally, as well as education reimbursement programs globally.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We continue to advance efforts to improve diversity, equity and inclusion within the Company, focusing on attracting and maintaining diverse talent within the organization and promoting awareness and acceptance globally. We believe that our diversity, equity and inclusion will make the Company a more desirable workplace and will lead to improved business performance.
