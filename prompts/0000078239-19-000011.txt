Company Overview
We are one of the largest branded apparel companies in the world, with a history going back over 135 years. We have over 38,000 associates operating in over 40 countries and generated $9.7 billion in revenues in 2018. Our brand portfolio consists of nationally and internationally recognized trademarks, including the global designer lifestyle brands TOMMY HILFIGER and CALVIN KLEIN, as well as Van Heusen, IZOD, ARROW, Warner’s, Olga, True&Co and Geoffrey Beene. We 
 1

also license brands from third parties, including Speedo (licensed in perpetuity for North America and the Caribbean), Kenneth Cole New York, Kenneth Cole Reaction, Unlisted, a Kenneth Cole Production, MICHAEL Michael Kors, Michael Kors Collection, DKNY and Chaps. Our brand portfolio also consists of various other owned, licensed and private label brands.

We design and market branded dress shirts, neckwear, sportswear, jeanswear, performance apparel, intimate apparel, underwear, swimwear, swim products, handbags, accessories, footwear and other related products. Our brands are positioned to sell globally at various price points and in multiple channels of distribution. This enables us to offer products to a broad range of consumers, while minimizing competition among our brands and reducing our reliance on any one demographic group, product category, price point, distribution channel or region. We also license the use of our trademarks to third parties and joint ventures for product categories and in regions where we believe our licensees’ expertise can better serve our brands. During 2018, our directly operated businesses in North America consisted principally of wholesale sales under our TOMMY HILFIGER, CALVIN KLEIN, Van Heusen, IZOD, ARROW, Speedo, Warner’s, Olga and Geoffrey Beene trademarks; the operation of digital commerce sites under the TOMMY HILFIGER, CALVIN KLEIN, Speedo, True&Co., Van Heusen and IZOD trademarks and the styleBureau.com digital commerce site; and the operation of retail stores, principally in premium outlet centers, primarily under our TOMMY HILFIGER, CALVIN KLEIN and certain of our heritage brands trademarks. Our directly operated businesses outside of North America consisted principally of our wholesale and retail sales in Europe and Asia under our TOMMY HILFIGER trademarks; our wholesale and retail sales in Europe, Asia and Latin America under our CALVIN KLEIN trademarks; and the operation of digital commerce sites under the TOMMY HILFIGER and CALVIN KLEIN trademarks. Our licensing activities principally related to the licensing worldwide of our TOMMY HILFIGER and CALVIN KLEIN trademarks for a broad array of product categories and for use in numerous discrete jurisdictions.
Our history of growth has been achieved through organic growth, as well as a number of acquisitions and strategic partnerships that have made us a more diversified global organization, with an extensive brand portfolio, retail footprint and distribution network, as well as a large consumer base. These acquisitions included Calvin Klein in 2003, Tommy Hilfiger in 2010, and Warnaco in 2013. We have also acquired or announced plans to acquire several regional licensed businesses where we believe that we have a core expertise and will continue to explore strategic acquisitions of licensed businesses, trademarks and companies that we believe are additive to our overall business.
We entered into on March 25, 2019 a definitive agreement to acquire the Tommy Hilfiger retail business in Hong Kong and certain other countries in Central and Southeast Asia from our current licensee in those markets (the “TH CSAP acquisition”). The closing is subject to customary conditions and regulatory approval and is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2019.
We entered into on February 20, 2019 a definitive agreement to acquire the approximately 78% interest in Gazal Corporation Limited (“Gazal”) that we do not already own (the “Australia acquisition”). We, along with Gazal, jointly own and manage a joint venture, PVH Brands Australia Pty. Limited (“PVH Australia”), which licenses and operates businesses under the TOMMY HILFIGER, CALVIN KLEIN and Van Heusen brands, along with other licensed and owned brands. PVH Australia will come under our full ownership as a result of the Australia acquisition. The closing is subject to customary conditions, including shareholder, court and regulatory approvals, and is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2019. 
We acquired the Geoffrey Beene tradename from Geoffrey Beene, LLC (“Geoffrey Beene”) on April 20, 2018. Prior to the acquisition, we had licensed the rights to design, market and distribute Geoffrey Beene dress shirts and neckwear from Geoffrey Beene. 
We restructured our supply chain relationship with Li & Fung Trading Limited (“Li & Fung”) in a transaction that closed on September 30, 2017. Our non-exclusive buying agency agreement with Li & Fung was terminated in connection with this transaction (the “Li & Fung termination”). 
We acquired True & Co., a direct-to-consumer intimate apparel digital commerce retailer on March 30, 2017. This acquisition enabled us to participate further in the fast-growing online channel and provided a platform to increase innovation, data-driven decisions and speed in the way we serve our consumers across our channels of distribution. 
We formed a joint venture in Mexico (“PVH Mexico”) in which we own a 49% economic interest on November 30, 2016. The joint venture was formed by merging our wholly owned subsidiary that principally operated and managed our Calvin Klein business in Mexico with a wholly owned subsidiary of Grupo Axo, S.A.P.I. de C.V. (“Grupo Axo”) that distributes certain TOMMY HILFIGER brand products in Mexico. In connection with the formation of PVH Mexico, we deconsolidated our wholly owned subsidiary (the “Mexico deconsolidation”). PVH Mexico licenses from certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
 2

the rights to distribute and sell certain TOMMY HILFIGER, CALVIN KLEIN, Warner’s, Olga and Speedo brand products in Mexico.
We acquired the 55% of the ownership interests in TH Asia, Ltd. (“TH China”), our former joint venture for TOMMY HILFIGER in China, that we did not already own (the “TH China acquisition”) on April 13, 2016. As a result of the TH China acquisition, we now operate directly our Tommy Hilfiger business in this market. 
We entered into a licensing agreement with G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. (“G-III”) for the design, production and wholesale distribution of TOMMY HILFIGER womenswear in the United States and Canada (the “G-III license”) on February 1, 2016, which resulted in the discontinuation of our directly operated Tommy Hilfiger North America womenswear wholesale business in the fourth quarter of 2016.
We aggregate our reportable segments into three main businesses: (i) Tommy Hilfiger, which consists of the Tommy Hilfiger North America and Tommy Hilfiger International segments; (ii) Calvin Klein, which consists of the Calvin Klein North America and Calvin Klein International segments; and (iii) Heritage Brands, which consists of the Heritage Brands Wholesale and Heritage Brands Retail segments. Note 20, “Segment Data,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report contains information with respect to revenue, income before interest and taxes, assets, depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures related to each segment, as well as information regarding our revenue generated by distribution channel and from foreign and domestic sources, and the geographic locations where our net property, plant and equipment is held.
Our 2018 revenue was $9.7 billion, of which over 50% was generated outside of the United States. Our global designer lifestyle brands, TOMMY HILFIGER and CALVIN KLEIN, together generated over 80% of our revenue during 2018.

• | Commercializing the CALVIN KLEIN creative vision to drive product improvement and expansion, particularly within men’s and women’s sportswear, performance apparel, jeanswear, accessories and women’s intimates.


• | Expanding our distribution by increasing our digital businesses and growing our presence in specialty stores.


• | Identifying operating efficiencies across the business to drive improvements in our operating margins.


• | Sharpening our processes and personalizing our customer relationships as we enhance our data capabilities.


• | Enhancing our supply chain to react more quickly to emerging business trends.


• | Gaining greater control of the brand by acquiring licensed businesses to operate them directly.

Heritage Brands Business
Our Heritage Brands business represents our original business, where we developed our core competencies, and is an important complement to our global designer brand businesses. We believe that this business can continue to capture market share and generate healthy cash flows as we execute against our key strategic initiatives, which include:

• | Being consumer-centric by designing and marketing quality, trend-right products that offer great value to our consumers and introducing products with new technologies and new features.


• | Driving consumer engagement by leveraging and enhancing each brand’s position in the market and delivering compelling marketing campaigns.


• | Seeking to maximize distribution, with the greatest opportunities in mass market retailers and digital commerce (through our wholesale partners, our own digital commerce sites and pure play digital commerce retailers).


• | Enhancing profitability by capitalizing on supply chain opportunities, reducing costs and maintaining a critical focus on inventory management.


• | Sharpening our processes and personalizing our customer relationships as we enhance our data capabilities.

 Other Strategic Opportunities 
While we believe we have an attractive and diverse portfolio of brands with growth potential, we will continue to explore strategic acquisitions of companies or trademarks and licensing opportunities that we believe are additive to our overall business. New license opportunities allow us to fill new product and brand portfolio needs. We take a disciplined approach to acquisitions, seeking brands with broad consumer recognition that we can grow profitably and expand by leveraging our infrastructure and core competencies and, where appropriate, by extending the brand through licensing.

Seasonality
Our business generally follows a seasonal pattern. Our wholesale businesses tend to generate higher levels of sales in the first and third quarters, while our retail businesses tend to generate higher levels of sales in the fourth quarter. Royalty, advertising and other revenue tends to be earned somewhat evenly throughout the year, although the third quarter has the highest level of royalty revenue due to higher sales by licensees in advance of the holiday selling season. We expect this seasonal pattern will generally continue. Working capital requirements vary throughout the year to support these seasonal patterns and business trends.
Design
Our business depends on our ability to stimulate and respond to consumer tastes and demands, as well as on our ability to remain competitive in the areas of quality and delivering a compelling price value proposition.
Our in-house design teams are significant contributors to the continued strength of our brands. Each of our branded businesses employs its own teams of designers and merchandisers that develop products representing its brand’s aesthetics, while also being mindful of consumers’ tastes, lifestyle needs and current fashion trends. To reflect consumer variances in each of our regional markets, the businesses tailor their products and offerings to appeal to local tastes, fit differences or other preferences, while maintaining the cohesive creative vision for each brand. 
Product Sourcing
Our capabilities for worldwide procurement and sourcing enable us to deliver to our customers competitive and high quality goods at an attractive value and on a timely basis. We have an extensive established network of worldwide sourcing partners that enables us to meet our customers’ needs in an efficient manner and not rely on any one vendor or factory or on vendors or factories in any one country. Our products were produced in over 1,200 factories in approximately 50 countries during 2018. All but one of these factories were operated by independent manufacturers, with most being located in Asia. 
We source finished products and, to a lesser extent, raw materials and trim. Raw materials and trim include fabric, buttons, thread, labels and similar components. Finished products consist of manufactured and fully assembled products ready for shipment to our customers and our stores. Raw material, trim, and finished product commitments are generally made two to six months prior to production. We believe we are one of the largest users of shirting fabric in the world. We believe that an ample number of alternative suppliers exist should we need to secure additional or replacement production capacity and raw materials. 
Our purchases from our suppliers are effected through individual purchase orders specifying the price, quantity, delivery date and destination of the items to be produced. Sales are monitored regularly at both the retail and wholesale levels and modifications in production can be made either to increase or reduce inventories. We look to establish long-term supplier relationships in the appropriate locations throughout the world to meet our needs and we place our orders in a manner designed to limit the risk that a production disruption at any one facility could cause a serious inventory problem, while seeking to maximize the pricing opportunities.

The manufacturers of our products are required to meet our quality, human rights, safety, environmental and cost requirements. Our global supply chain teams, offices and buying agents enable us to monitor the quality of the goods manufactured by, and the delivery performance of, our suppliers, and work with our global compliance teams to ensure the enforcement of our human rights and labor standards and other code of conduct requirements through our ongoing extensive training, approval and monitoring system. They also monitor and track the primary cost inputs to the finished product to ensure that we pay the most appropriate cost for our finished goods. We continue to assess our manufacturing footprint to ensure we have the best infrastructure to meet the needs of our global wholesale and retail businesses.
We continue to make progress on maintaining an agile and data-driven supply chain. We have made advancements to capture additional gross margin opportunities, as we continue to optimize our vendor base to work more closely with long-term strategic partners, focus on core replenishment for select categories and improve our speed to market. We have also developed a country of origin strategy that provides a flexible approach to product sourcing, which enables us to maximize regional opportunities and mitigate our potential exposure to risks associated with new duties, tariffs, surcharges, or other import controls or restrictions. We believe the enhancement of our supply chain efficiencies and working capital management through the effective use of our distribution network and overall infrastructure will allow us to control costs better and provide improved service to our customers.

We restructured our supply chain relationship with Li & Fung in 2017 in line with our supply chain priorities. In connection with this transaction, we terminated our non-exclusive buying agency agreement with Li & Fung and entered into a new agreement that will allow us to evolve our supply chain, while also building upon our operating platforms to enhance our efficiencies across the organization.
We also began producing finished products in Ethiopia during 2017 to evolve our supply chain and become more dynamic. Production is through a joint venture, PVH Arvind Manufacturing Private Limited Company (“PVH Ethiopia”), that we formed with Arvind Limited (“Arvind”). The goods produced are primarily distributed in the United States by our Heritage Brands business.
Corporate Responsibility
As an industry leader and one of the largest branded apparel companies in the world, we recognize that we have a responsibility to address our social and environmental impacts. Corporate responsibility is central to how we conduct business and it is a crucial consideration embodied in all of the strategic business decisions that we make. 
Building on our long-standing commitment to responsible business, in January 2019 we launched the next evolution of our Corporate Responsibility strategy - Forward Fashion. Our Forward Fashion strategy supports the standards released by the Global Fashion Agenda in its CEO Agenda 2019, which reflect global developments and focus on climate change as a core priority. 
Our three strategic focus areas are:

• | Reduce negative impacts — Our ambition is for our products and business operations to generate zero waste, zero carbon and zero hazardous chemicals. This means protecting our global climate by reducing energy use and powering our business through renewable sources, diverting the waste we send to landfills, eliminating water pollution from our wet processors, and fostering and harnessing innovation to design and manufacture products that eliminate product waste.


• | Increase positive impacts — Our ambition is for 100% of our products and packaging to be ethically and sustainably sourced from suppliers who respect human rights and are good employers.


• | Improve lives across our value chain — Our ambition is to improve the lives of over one million people across our value chain, focusing on education and opportunities for women and children, ensuring access to clean water and continuing to champion inclusion and diversity.

We issue an annual report on our corporate responsibility efforts that can be found on our corporate website at PVH.com/responsibility.
Warehousing, Distribution and Logistics
Our products are shipped from manufacturers to our wholesale and retail warehousing and distribution centers for inspection, sorting, packing and shipment. Centers range in size and our main facilities, some of which are operated by independent third parties, are located in the United States, the Netherlands, Canada, China, Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan and Brazil. Our warehousing and distribution centers are designed to provide responsive service to our customers and our retail stores on a cost-effective basis. 
Our backlog of customer orders totaled $1.652 billion and $2.097 billion as of February 3, 2019 and February 4, 2018, respectively. The size of our order backlog depends upon a number of factors, including the timing of the market weeks for our particular lines, during which a significant percentage of our orders are received, and the timing of the shipments, which varies from year-to-year with consideration for holidays, consumer trends, concept plans, and the usage of our basic stock replenishment programs. As a consequence, a comparison of the size of our order backlog from period to period may not be meaningful, nor may it be indicative of eventual shipments.
Material Customers
Our largest customers account for significant portions of our revenue. Sales to our five largest customers were 18.9% of our revenue in each of 2018 and 2017, and 21.3% of our revenue in 2016. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in 2018, 2017 or 2016.

Advertising and Promotion
Our marketing programs are an integral component of the success of our brands and the products offered under them. We intend for each of our brands to be a leader in its respective market segment, with strong consumer awareness, relevance and consumer loyalty. We believe that our brands are successful in their respective market segments because we have strategically positioned each brand to target a distinct consumer demographic. Advertisements generally portray a lifestyle representation of our category offerings rather than a specific item. We design and market our products to complement each other, satisfy lifestyle needs, emphasize product features important to our target consumers, deliver a strong price/value proposition and encourage consumer loyalty.
A significant component of our marketing programs is digital media, including our digital commerce platforms and social media channels, which allow us to expand our reach to customers and enable us to provide timely information in an entertaining fashion to consumers about our products, special events, promotions and store locations. Tommy Hilfiger’s digital commerce site, tommy.com, and Calvin Klein’s digital commerce site, calvinklein.com, serve as marketing vehicles to complement the ongoing development of the TOMMY HILFIGER and CALVIN KLEIN lifestyle brands, respectively, in addition to offering a broad array of apparel and licensed products. Additionally, during 2018, we launched our own Heritage Brands digital commerce sites. 
We also advertise through print media (including fashion, entertainment/human interest, business, men’s, women’s and sports magazines and newspapers), on television, through outdoor signage and through in-store point of sale materials, as well as participate in cooperative advertising programs with our retail partners. In addition, we advertise our brands through sport sponsorships and product tie-ins. We believe that our use of high-profile brand ambassadors and well-known social media influencers across our marketing programs helps drive our brand awareness and cultural relevance. 
With respect to our retail outlet stores, the majority of which are located in premium outlet centers in the United States and Canada, we generally rely upon local outlet mall developers to promote traffic for their centers. Outlet center developers employ multiple formats, including signage, print advertising, direct marketing, radio and television advertising, and special promotions.
Tommy Hilfiger Business
We believe that TOMMY HILFIGER is one of the world’s leading designer lifestyle brands and is internationally recognized for celebrating the essence of classic American cool style with a preppy twist. Tommy Hilfiger employs advertising, marketing and communications staff, including an in-house creative team, as well as outside agencies, to implement its global marketing and communications strategy across all channels of distribution. The Tommy Hilfiger marketing and communications team develops and coordinates TOMMY HILFIGER advertising for all regions and product lines, licensees and regional distributors. Advertisements for TOMMY HILFIGER brand products appear primarily in social media outlets, fashion and lifestyle magazines, newspapers, outdoor media and cinema and on television. The digital and online focus of marketing for the TOMMY HILFIGER brands is integral to its campaigns and continues to increase. Additionally, the marketing and communications team coordinates personal appearances by Mr. Tommy Hilfiger, including at runway shows and brand events as part of its efforts. Tommy Hilfiger maintains multiple showroom facilities and sales offices around the world. Nearly all of its showrooms are digitized, offering a more engaging, integrated and seamless buying experience for its wholesale partners. 
Tommy Hilfiger embarked on new exclusive, high-profile partnerships in 2018 to continue its efforts to reach new, younger audiences, while also appealing to its existing consumers. It delivered celebrity partnerships and exciting new brand activations, with a particular focus on the product categories where we see the greatest expansion opportunities - womenswear, accessories, denim, underwear and men’s tailored clothing.
One of Tommy Hilfiger’s largest collaborations during the year was its partnership with British Formula OneTM racing driver and five-time Formula OneTM World Champion Lewis Hamilton, who appeared as the global brand ambassador for TOMMY HILFIGER men’s for Spring and Fall 2018. In conjunction with this, TOMMY HILFIGER formed a multi-year strategic partnership with four-time World Champions Mercedes-AMG Petronas Motorsport as their Official Apparel Partner, beginning in Spring 2018. These partnerships reflect the brand’s strategic commitment to build on its strong menswear heritage and further drive the global growth of its men’s business, while also bringing the next generation of fans to the brand. To capitalize on the power of the collaboration, Tommy Hilfiger offered its first TommyXLewis collaborative collection in Fall 2018 with a world tour that included the TOMMYNOW Fall 2018 fashion show in Shanghai, an industry event in New York City, and a presentation as a 3D holographic water projection in Tokyo. In conjunction with these events, we launched a Super 
 13

Brand day on Tmall, which offered a seamless consumer experience, including order delivery within 24 hours in key Chinese cities.
Tommy Hilfiger also delivered engaging marketing campaigns geared toward the female consumer, as we believe that it is significantly underpenetrated in women’s apparel and accessories. The brand continued its successful partnership with Gigi Hadid for Spring 2018, which marked her final season serving as a brand ambassador and designer of the TommyXGigi capsule collection. Continuing with the “see now, buy now” realm, the brand’s TOMMYNOW Spring 2018 fashion show in Milan featured the TommyXGigi capsule collection, which allowed consumers to purchase immediately items featured on the runway through tommy.com, as well as in TOMMY HILFIGER stores and through select wholesale partners globally. As the year progressed, Tommy Hilfiger enlisted model Hailey Bieber, model and activist Winnie Harlow and actress Maggie Jiang as the newest members of the TOMMY HILFIGER family, with the celebrities serving as the new global brand ambassadors for TOMMY HILFIGER women’s for Fall 2018, as well as starring in the Fall 2018 TOMMY ICONS capsule collection for women. 
Tommy Hilfiger named Zendaya as the brand’s female brand ambassador beginning in Spring 2019. Zendaya helped to design a TommyXZendaya capsule collection as part of our vision to collaborate with icons who share the brand’s spirit and values of breaking conventions and celebrating diversity. 
Tommy Hilfiger also offered exciting brand activations and more frequent product drops. It collaborated with several of the trendiest streetwear brands, including KITH, Vetements and Monkey Time, to drive desire for TOMMY HILFIGER with the younger fashion consumer. Additionally, the TOMMY JEANS Spring and Fall 2018 marketing campaigns featured a collection of millennial influencers.

Calvin Klein Business
We believe Calvin Klein is one of the best known designer names in the world, exemplifying bold, progressive ideals and a seductive, often minimalist aesthetic. As the CALVIN KLEIN brand celebrates its 51st year in business, it continues to experience compelling brand and cultural relevancy by evolving and driving consumer engagement. We announced in January 2019 that we established the CMO, which encompasses the business’s marketing, communications, social media, celebrity dressing and special events. The CMO will focus on creative consistency and consumer-centric marketing to drive sales, while also building personalized relationships and tailoring the overall consumer experience through its highly specialized teams. We believe that this enhanced marketing approach will better meet our consumers’ needs as we adapt to their rapidly changing demands. Calvin Klein maintains showrooms and sales offices around the world.
Consumer engagement remained at the core of Calvin Klein in 2018, as it delivered immersive brand experiences, with a particular focus on youth-minded consumers. Calvin Klein leveraged the already-successful #MYCALVINS legacy and amplified its commerciality by enlisting sisters Kim Kardashian West, Khloé Kardashian, Kourtney Kardashian, Kendall Jenner and Kylie Jenner as brand ambassadors for CALVIN KLEIN JEANS and CALVIN KLEIN UNDERWEAR in Spring and Fall 2018. Calvin Klein also engaged Taiwanese musician Jam Hsiao and Chinese actress Jelly Lin as local brand ambassadors for the Spring and Fall 2018 men’s and women’s collections.
Understanding that today’s consumer is increasingly sophisticated and places a premium on brand authenticity, Calvin Klein began to balance the global brand campaigns with the use of smaller-scale regional and micro-influencers. Also under the #MYCALVINS platform, Calvin Klein enlisted a diverse set of models, artists, fashion bloggers and other social influencers wearing a wide array of CALVIN KLEIN product offerings and plans to expand significantly upon this in 2019.
Digital experiences remained a priority as we continued to grow online sales. Calvin Klein invested in key partnerships, including its collaboration with Zalando in Europe for their 10th anniversary. To celebrate, Calvin Klein offered an exclusive capsule collection, which featured model siblings Kaia and Presley Gerber and was accompanied by a television and social media campaign. 
Heritage Brands Business
In our Heritage Brands business, we leveraged and enhanced each brand’s position in the market by delivering engaging marketing campaigns, with a particular focus on driving relevance with younger consumers. We launched a partnership for Van Heusen with the UFC® that featured MMA fighters Stephen Thompson and T.J. Dillashaw as brand ambassadors. The campaign had digital and social engagement rates that far exceeded our expectations. We also launched our largest media campaign to-date for IZOD that features Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers and comedian Colin Jost from Saturday Night Live. There were engagement opportunities for Speedo, as well, including industry events such as Miami 
 14

Swim Week, and a celebration of Fitness Month by having our Speedo USA team ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange on January 2, 2018, the first trading day of the new year.
We continue to promote our Heritage Brands business through sport sponsorships. Four-time PGA Tour winner Marc Leishman serves as brand ambassador for IZOD Golf, which includes wearing IZOD Golf apparel on-course. Olympic gold medalists and World No. 1 ranked men’s double tennis team, Bob and Mike Bryan continue to serve as brand ambassadors for IZOD. Team Speedo USA consists of world-class swimmers, including Caeleb Dressel, Ryan Murphy, Nathan Adrian, Kathleen Baker and Para-Olympian Becca Meyers. These athletes wear Speedo products exclusively in competition and participate in various promotional activities on behalf of the brand. In addition, we have an all-brand, regional sponsorship relationship with the New York Giants.
We also advertised the Warner’s No Side Effects and Cloud 9 bras and True&Co. True Body Collection bras on television during 2018. Additionally, we leveraged strategic new platforms to commercialize Heritage Brands products, including efforts to develop the Speedo Fit training program by building relevancy through partnerships with personal trainers, gyms and fitness professionals.
Trademarks
We own the TOMMY HILFIGER, CALVIN KLEIN, Van Heusen, IZOD, ARROW, Warner’s, Olga, True&Co. and Geoffrey Beene brands, as well as related trademarks (e.g., the interlocking “IZ” logo for IZOD and the TOMMY HILFIGER flag logo and crest design) and lesser-known names. These trademarks are registered for use in each of the primary countries where our products are sold and additional applications for registration of these and other trademarks are made in jurisdictions to accommodate new marks, uses in additional trademark classes or additional categories of goods or expansion into new countries.

Mr. Tommy Hilfiger is prohibited in perpetuity from using, or authorizing others to use, the TOMMY HILFIGER marks (except for the use by Mr. Hilfiger of his name personally and in connection with certain specified activities). In addition, we are prohibited in perpetuity from selling products not ordinarily sold under the names of prestige designer businesses or prestige global lifestyle brands without Mr. Hilfiger’s consent, from engaging in new lines of business materially different from such types of lines of business without Mr. Hilfiger’s consent, or from disparaging or intentionally tarnishing the TOMMY HILFIGER-related marks or Mr. Hilfiger’s personal name. 
We own the CALVIN KLEIN marks and derivative marks in all trademark classes and for all product categories through our Calvin Klein and Warnaco subsidiaries’ ownership of the Calvin Klein Trademark Trust (“the Trust”), which is the sole and exclusive title owner of substantially all registrations of the CALVIN KLEIN trademarks. The sole purpose of the Trust is to hold these marks. Calvin Klein maintains and protects the marks on behalf of the Trust. The Trust licenses to Calvin Klein and Warnaco on an exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual and royalty-free basis the use of the marks.
Mr. Calvin Klein retains the right to use his name, on a non-competitive basis, with respect to his right of publicity, unless those rights are already being used in the Calvin Klein business. Mr. Klein has also been granted a royalty-free worldwide right to use the CALVIN KLEIN mark with respect to certain personal businesses and activities, subject to certain limitations designed to protect the image and prestige of the CALVIN KLEIN brands and to avoid competitive conflicts.
Our trademarks are the subject of registrations and pending applications throughout the world for use on a variety of apparel, footwear and related products, as well as licensed product categories, and we continue to expand our worldwide usage and registration of new and related trademarks. In general, trademarks remain valid and enforceable as long as the marks continue to be used in connection with the products and services with which they are identified and, as to registered tradenames, the required registration renewals are filed. In markets where products bearing any of our brands are not sold by us or any of our licensees or other authorized users, our rights to the use of trademarks may not be clearly established.
Our trademarks and other intellectual property rights are valuable assets and we vigorously seek to protect them on a worldwide basis against infringement. We are susceptible to others imitating our products and infringing on our intellectual property rights. This is especially the case with respect to the TOMMY HILFIGER and CALVIN KLEIN brands, as these brands enjoy significant worldwide consumer recognition and their generally higher pricing (as compared to our heritage brands) provides significant opportunity and incentive for counterfeiters and infringers. We have broad, proactive enforcement programs that we believe have been generally effective in controlling the sale of counterfeit products in the United States and in major markets abroad.

Competition
The apparel industry is competitive as a result of its fashion orientation, mix of large and small producers, low barriers to entry, the flow of domestic and imported merchandise and the wide diversity of retailing methods. We compete with numerous domestic and foreign designers, brands owners, manufacturers and retailers of apparel, accessories and footwear, including, in certain circumstances, the private label brands of our wholesale customers. Additionally, with the shift in consumer shopping preferences driving growth in the digital channel, there are more companies in the apparel sector and an increased level of transparency in pricing and product comparisons, which impacts purchasing decisions.
We believe we are well-positioned to compete in the apparel industry on the basis of style, quality, price and service. Our business depends on our ability to stimulate consumer tastes and demands, as well as on our ability to remain competitive in these areas. Our diversified portfolio of brands and products and our use of multiple channels of distribution have allowed us to develop a business that produces results that are not dependent on any one demographic group, merchandise preference, distribution channel or region. We have developed a portfolio of brands that appeals to a broad spectrum of consumers. Our owned brands have long histories and enjoy high recognition and awareness within their respective consumer segments. We develop our owned and licensed brands to complement each other and to generate strong consumer loyalty. The worldwide recognition of the TOMMY HILFIGER and CALVIN KLEIN brands generally provide us with significant global opportunities and the opportunity to develop businesses that target different consumer groups at higher price points and in higher-end distribution channels than our heritage brands.
Imports and Import Restrictions
A substantial portion of our products is imported into the United States, Canada, Europe, Asia and Latin America. These products are subject to various customs laws, which may impose tariffs, as well as quota restrictions. In addition, each of the countries in which our products are sold has laws and regulations covering imports. The United States and other countries in which our products are sold may impose, from time to time, new duties, tariffs, surcharges, or other import controls or restrictions, including the imposition of a “safeguard quota,” or adjust presently prevailing duty or tariff rates or levels. We, therefore, maintain a program of intensive monitoring of import restrictions and developments. We seek to minimize our potential exposure to import related risks through, among other measures, adjustments in product design and fabrication, shifts of production among countries, including consideration of countries with tariff preference and free trade agreements, and manufacturers, and geographical diversification of our sources of supply.
Environmental Matters
Our facilities and operations are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. In addition, we may incur liability under environmental statutes and regulations with respect to the contamination of sites that we own or operate or previously owned or operated (including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites, abutters or other persons) and the off-site disposal of hazardous materials. We believe our operations are in compliance with the terms of all applicable laws and regulations and our compliance with these laws and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position.
Employees
As of February 3, 2019, we employed approximately 20,500 persons on a full-time basis and approximately 17,500 persons on a part-time basis. Approximately 2% of our employees were represented for the purpose of collective bargaining by four different unions in the United States. Additional persons, some represented by these four unions, are employed from time to time based upon our manufacturing schedules and retailing seasonal needs. Our collective bargaining agreements generally are for three-year terms. In some international markets, a significant percentage of employees are covered by governmental labor arrangements. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
