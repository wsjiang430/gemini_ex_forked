As of December 31, 2022, we had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022, relates to our focus on effecting a “reverse merger,” capital exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more unrelated businesses (the “Business Combination”) that would benefit from our public reporting status. In addition, we completed a change of control transaction on July 21, 2022 (the “Change of Control”) as discussed below. See Item 1. Business – Recent Developments - Change of Control. In furtherance of our plans to consummate a Business Combination, on January 19, 2023 we entered into an Exchange Agreement to acquire RF Specialties LLC (“RFS”) and on February 13, 2023, we entered into a Merger Agreement to acquire Two Trees Beverage Co. (“Two Trees”) discussed below (collectively, the “Planned Acquisitions”). See Item 1. Business – Recent Developments – RF Specialties, Inc. and Item 1. Business – Recent Developments –Two Trees.
 
RFS is engaged in the business of developing sustainable radio frequency (RF) applications, and for over 12 years, has addressed the challenges faced by companies by implementing automated radio frequency technology. RFS has developed a system and method for the rapid aging of distilled spirits with RF energy that reduces energy and production costs thus increasing the speed to market for distilled beverages when compared to traditional technologies.
 
● Two Trees is engaged in the business of producing aged alcoholic beverages by using a proprietary, scalable, and sustainable rapid-aging system.
 
● We expect to complete the Planned Acquisitions once all closing conditions discussed below have been met. 
 
All activity through the date of this report relates to preserving cash, making settlements with creditors, attempting to raise capital, and continuing the Company’s public reporting and efforts to complete the Change of Control and Planned Acquisitions.


History of the Company
 
We were organized and incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 22, 2003 under the name Western Exploration, Inc. as a resource exploration stage company. In November 2005, we ceased operations as a resource exploration company due to inadequate financing. On November 16, 2005, Western Exploration, Inc. engaged in a merger with MDwerks Global Holdings, Inc. and MDwerks Acquisition Corp., a Florida corporation (‘‘Acquisition Corp.’’), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Western Exploration, Inc., with MDwerks Global Holdings, Inc. surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Western Exploration, Inc. Upon the closing of the Merger, we changed our corporate name from ‘‘Western Exploration, Inc.’’ to ‘‘MDwerks, Inc.’’ and succeeded to the business of MDwerks Global Holdings, Inc. as our sole line of business under the direction of MDwerks Global Holdings, Inc.’s management. On February 12, 2010, MDwerks, Inc. ceased all operations. On or about June 23, 2021, we began the process of seeking to create value for our shareholders by merging with another entity with experienced management and opportunities for growth in return for shares of our common stock and on June 23, 2021 we filed a Registration Statement on Form 10 with the SEC to register our common stock under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
 
Additional information on our historical business has been disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2021 (incorporated by reference to the Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 15, 2022 (File No. 000-56299)).
 
Recent Developments
 
Change of Control
 
On July 21, 2022, the Company in connection with the change of control and composition of the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with (i) Tradition Reserve I LLC, a New York limited liability company (“Buyer”); and (ii) Ronin Equity Partners, Inc., a Texas corporation (“Seller”).

Pursuant to the SPA, the Seller sold to the Buyer, on July 21, 2022 (the “Closing Date”) free and clear of all liens, 10,000,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 (“Preferred Stock”) of the Company, held by the Seller (the “Shares”), representing 100% of the Company’s authorized and issued Preferred Stock, as of the Closing Date. In exchange for the sale of the Shares to Buyer, Buyer paid the Seller a total purchase price of $520,000 (the “Purchase Price”).
 
Further, at the closing of the transactions contemplated within the SPA (which include, but are not limited to, the purchases and sales of the Shares described above) (the “Closing”), the parties agreed that as of the Closing:
 

a) | The Forgiven Debt (as defined hereinafter) was forgiven, as well as the Asia Note (as defined hereinafter), and any other loan agreements between the Company and Asia Pacific Partners, Inc. (“APP”), a Florida corporation. The Parties acknowledge and agreed that the Company was indebted to APP, an affiliate of the Seller, in the amount of approximately $239,444, comprised of (i) the principal amount and accrued interest pursuant to a convertible promissory note dated July 18, 2014 in the amount of $210,000 as originally issued by the Company to Azure Associates, Inc. and purchased by APP on July 28th, 2020 (the “Asia Note”), and (ii) various cash advances for a total of $29,444 as advanced by APP to the Company for working capital (the “Asia Cash Advances” and, together with any and all amounts that may have been due and payable pursuant to the Asia Note, the “Forgiven Debt”); 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
b) | The Company’s Board of Directors was required to undertake such actions as required to: 
 | (i) | Expand the Company Board to be a number of persons as determined by Buyer, and to name such persons as selected by Buyer as directors on the Company Board; 
 | (ii) | Name such persons as selected by Buyer as officers of the Company, to the positions as determined by Buyer; and 
 | (iii) | Following (i) and (ii), all of the directors and officers of the Company, other than those named in or pursuant to (i) and (ii) shall resign from all such positions with the Company. 

 
The Closing was subject to certain customary closing conditions, including, but not limited to, the accuracy of the representations and warranties made by the parties, all necessary consents having been obtained to effect the transactions, and the receipt of any necessary government approvals in order to effect the transactions contemplated in the SPA.
 
Prior to the Closing of the SPA, voting control of the Company was held by the Seller, of which Jacob D. Cohen was the primary shareholder, and held voting and dispositive control over the Shares.
 
On the Closing Date, Buyer purchased the Shares, which both pre- and post-conversion represented approximately 98.23% of the Company’s outstanding voting securities as of the date of the Current Report, resulting in a change in control of the Company. The Company had previously designated the Preferred Stock so that each share would hold with it conversion rights of one hundred (100) shares of common stock for every share of Preferred stock held, and that each share of Preferred stock will also hold with it the same number of common share votes prior to conversion as it would if fully converted to be used in voting on any company matter requiring a vote of shareholders. At the Closing Date, there were 18,010,208 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. Kerry Cassidy is the majority membership unit holder and Managing Member of the Buyer, and therefore is deemed to have voting and dispositive power over the Company’s Shares held by the Buyer.
 
As a result of the Closing, the Company was no longer a company controlled by the Seller. Prior to the Closing, the Company was a shell company, and following the Closing, the Company continues to be a shell company. There has been no change in the Company’s shell company status or the Company’s operations as a result of the Closing.
 
Planned Acquisitions
 
RF Specialties, Inc.
 
On January 19, 2023, we entered into an Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) by and between the Company, RFS and Keith A. Mort as the sole member of RFS. Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, the Company agreed to acquire from Mr. Mort, and Mr. Mort agreed to sell to the Company, 100% of the equity interests and membership interests of RFS, in exchange for the issuance by the Company to Mr. Mort of 7,500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Exchange”). Immediately following the Exchange, RFS will be a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.

The shares received by Mr. Mort in the Exchange (the “Exchange Shares”) will be subject to a 24-month lock-up; provided, however, that (i) one-third of the Exchange Shares will be released from the lock-up restrictions on the 12-month anniversary of the closing of the Exchange, and (ii) one-third of the Exchange Shares will be released from the lock-up restrictions on the 18-month anniversary of the closing of the Exchange. The remaining one-third of the Exchange Shares will be released from the lock-up restrictions on the 24-month anniversary of the closing of the Exchange.
 
The parties have made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Exchange Agreement. In addition to certain customary closing conditions, the obligations of the Company to consummate the closing of the Exchange are subject to the satisfaction (or waiver by the Company), at or before the closing date, of certain conditions, including that (i) RFS will have provided to the Company audited financial statements for RFS for each of the two most recently ended fiscal years and unaudited financial statements for any other required interim periods (the “Financial Statements Closing Condition”), and (ii) the Company will have completed its due diligence review and examination of RFS to its satisfaction in its sole discretion (the “Due Diligence Closing Condition”).

(c) | By RFS and Mr. Mort acting together (i) if the closing conditions applicable to all parties and applicable to RFS and Mr. Mort have not been satisfied or waived by RFS and Mr. Mort, which waiver RFS and Mr. Mort may give or withhold in their sole discretion, by the Termination Date; provided, however, that RFS and Mr. Mort may not terminate the Exchange Agreement if the reason for the failure of any such condition to occur was the breach of the terms of the Exchange Agreement by any of RFS or Mr. Mort; or (ii) if there has been a material violation, breach or inaccuracy of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company as set forth in the Exchange Agreement; 
(d) | By any party to the Exchange Agreement, if a court of competent jurisdiction or other governmental authority shall have issued an order or taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Agreement and such order or action shall have become final and nonappealable; or 
(e) | By the Company, if the Company, in its sole discretion, at any time prior to the closing of the Exchange determines that its due diligence review of RFS is not satisfactory to the Company.
