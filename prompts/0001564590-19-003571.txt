Additional information required by this Item 1 regarding developments in the Company’s business during 2018 is contained under Item 7 in this Annual Report.
 
Financial Information on Segments
 Upon completion of the spin-off, Autoliv concluded at June 30, 2018 that it has one reportable segment based on the way the Company evaluates its financial performance and manages its operations. Prior to the completion of the Spin-off, the Company had two reportable segments, Electronics and Passive Safety. The Company’s single operating segment includes the Company’s airbag (including steering wheels), seatbelt products and components. For financial reporting purposes, the single operating segment is also the Company’s single reportable segment in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 280 Segment Reporting. The financial data relating to Autoliv’s businesses in this segment over the last three fiscal years is contained in the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report. A statement of net sales by product group and region for the last three years is contained in Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report.
Products, Market and Competition 
 Products
 Saving more lives on the road is a key health priority as our world grows and develops. However, population expansion in growth markets and the rise of megacities creates new complexities. To meet this challenge, we develop automotive safety solutions that work in real life situations. 
 Our safety systems such as seatbelts and airbags substantially mitigate human consequences of traffic accidents.
 The airbag module is designed to inflate extremely rapidly then quickly deflate during a collision or impact. It consists of the container, airbag cushion and an inflator. The purpose of the airbag is to provide the occupants a cushioning and restraint during a crash event to prevent any impact or impact-caused injuries between the occupant and the interior of the vehicle. 
 Seatbelts can reduce the overall risk of serious injuries in frontal crashes by as much as 60% thanks to advanced seatbelt technologies such as pretensioners and load limiters.
 Autoliv also manufactures steering wheels which are crafted to ensure they meet safety requirements and are functional as well as stylish.

Market and Competition
 Consumer research clearly shows that people want safe cars, and several significant trends are likely to have a positive influence on overall safety content per vehicle. These include:
 1) Society becoming increasingly focused on Vision Zero, which includes a goal of reducing traffic fatalities and their associated costs,
 2) Demographic trends of increased urbanization, aging driver populations and increased safety focus in the Growth Markets, and
 3) Evolving government regulations and test rating systems to improve the safety of vehicles in various markets, such as the updated Euro NCAP, China NCAP and USNCAP.
 The automotive safety market is driven by two primary factors: light vehicle production (LVP) and content per vehicle (CPV).
 The first growth driver, LVP, has increased at an average annual growth rate of around 2.6% since the incorporation of Autoliv Inc. in 1997 despite the cyclical nature of the automotive industry. LVP is expected to grow to close to 97 million in 2021 from approximately 91 million in 2018, according to IHS. Almost all of this expansion will be in the Growth Markets, predominantly in China, India, Southeast Asia and South America.
 Unlike LVP, where Autoliv can only aim to be on the best-selling platforms, Autoliv can influence CPV more directly by continuously developing and introducing new technologies with higher value-added features. Over the long term, this increases average safety CPV and has caused our markets to grow faster than the LVP. 
 
Since the start of Autoliv, Inc. in 1997, the Company’s sales compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for passive safety has been 5.6% compared to the market rate of around 3% which includes an LVP growth of around 2.6%. Our outperformance is a result of a steady flow of new passive safety technologies, strong focus on quality and a superior global footprint both in products and engineering. This has enabled Autoliv to increase its market share from 27% in 1997 to around 40% in 2018.
 In the Developed Markets (Western Europe, North America, Japan and South Korea) the CPV is around $280. CPV growth in these regions will mainly come from new safety systems such as active seatbelts, knee airbags, front-center airbags along with improved protection for pedestrians and rear-seat occupants like bag-in-belt. 
 In our Growth Markets, we see great opportunities for CPV growth from more airbags and advanced seatbelt products. Average CPV in our Growth Markets is around $170, approximately $110 less than in the Developed Markets. 
 Despite a negative LVP mix effect from higher growth in low CPV markets, the passive safety market (seatbelts and airbags, including steering wheels), is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4% until 2021 to about $23 billion, based on the current macro-economic outlook and our internal market intelligence and estimates. The highest growth rate is expected in steering wheels, where Autoliv has a global market share of more than 30%, generated by the trend toward higher-value steering wheels with leather and additional features.
 The Growth Markets are expected to outgrow the Developed Markets substantially for the period between 2018 and 2021, as the Growth Markets are supported by a higher LVP and increasing CPV resulting from higher penetration of airbags and more advanced seatbelt products.
 In seatbelts, Autoliv has reached a global market share of around 40%, primarily due to being the technology leader with several important innovations such as pretensioners and active seatbelts. Our strong market position is also a reflection of our superior global footprint. Seatbelts are the primary life-saving safety product and are also an important requirement in low-end vehicles for the Growth Markets. This provides us with an excellent opportunity to benefit from the expected growth in this segment of the market.
 The market for airbags, where Autoliv has a market share of around 40%, is expected to grow slightly slower than the total passive safety market. This is related to the dilutive effect from new low-end vehicles in the Growth Markets, with relatively low installation rates for airbags.
 
Our competitors
 Autoliv is the clear market leader with an estimated global market share of around 40%. Our major competitors have traditionally been Takata and ZF.
 During 2017, Takata, a family-controlled Japanese company whose shares were listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. and Japan. The bankruptcy came after an accumulation of recall costs and liabilities related to malfunctioning airbag inflators. U.S.-based Key Safety Systems (KSS), owned by Chinese company Joyson, subsequently acquired Takata’s assets in April 2018 for approximately $1.6 billion. The new company is named Joyson Safety Systems (JSS). JSS is estimated to hold a global market share of 24%, including Joyson’s Chinese subsidiary YFK. 
 ZF is a global leader in driveline and chassis technology, as well as in passive safety technologies, and is one of the largest global automotive suppliers and has an estimated global market share of 17%.

In Japan, Brazil, South Korea and China there are a number of local suppliers that have close ties with the domestic vehicle manufacturers. For example, Toyota uses “keiretsu” (in-house) suppliers Tokai Rika for seatbelts and Toyoda Gosei for airbags and steering wheels. These suppliers generally receive most of the Toyota business in Japan, in the same way, Mobis, a major supplier to Hyundai/Kia in South Korea, generally receives a significant part of their business.
 Other competitors include Nihon Plast and Ashimori of Japan, Jinheng of China, Samsong in South Korea and Chris in South America. Collectively, these competitors account for the majority of the remaining 19% global market share in passive safety.
 Additional information concerning our products, markets and competition is included in the “Risks and Risk Management” section under Item 7 of this Annual Report.
 
Manufacturing and Production
 Including joint venture operations, Autoliv has 64 production facilities located in 25 countries, consisting of both component factories and assembly factories. See “Item 2. Properties” for a description of Autoliv’s principal properties. The component factories manufacture inflators, propellant, initiators, textile cushions, webbing, pressed steel parts, springs and overmoulded steel parts used in seatbelt and airbag assembly and steering wheels. The assembly factories source components from a number of parties, including Autoliv’s own component factories, and assemble complete restraint systems for “just-in-time” delivery to customers. The products manufactured by Autoliv’s consolidated subsidiaries in 2018 consisted of approximately 151 million complete seatbelt systems (of which approximately 79 million were fitted with pretensioners), approximately 99 million side airbags (including curtain airbags), approximately 56 million frontal airbag and approximately 20 million steering wheels.
 
Autoliv’s “just-in-time” delivery systems have been designed to accommodate the specific requirements of each customer for low levels of inventory and rapid stock delivery service. “Just-in-time” deliveries require final assembly or, at least, distribution centers in geographic areas close to customers to facilitate rapid delivery. The fact that the major automobile manufacturers are continually expanding their production activities into more countries and require the same or similar safety systems as those produced in Europe, Japan or the U.S. increases the importance for suppliers to have assembly capacity in several countries. Consolidation among our customers also supports this trend.
 
Autoliv’s assembly operations generally are not constrained by capacity considerations unless there is a disruption in the supply of raw materials and components. When dramatic shifts in LVP occur, Autoliv can generally adjust capacity in response to any changes in demand within a few days by adding or removing work shifts and within a few months by adding or removing standardized production and assembly lines. Most of Autoliv’s assembly factories can make sufficient space available to accommodate additional production lines to satisfy foreseeable increases in capacity. As a result, Autoliv can usually adjust its manufacturing capacity faster than its customers can adjust their capacity as a result of fluctuations in the general demand for vehicles or in the demand for a specific vehicle model, provided that customers promptly notify Autoliv when they become aware of such changes in demand.
 
When dramatic shifts in LVP occur or when there is a shift in regional LVP, the capacity adjustments can take more time and be more costly. Additionally, when there is a significant demand for a given product due to a major recall of a competitor’s product, like certain of our customers have experienced, capacity adjustments may take time.
 
We could experience disruption in our supply or delivery chain, which could cause one or more of our customers to halt or delay production. For more information, see Item 1A – “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report.
 
Quality Management
 Autoliv believes that superior quality is a prerequisite to being considered a leading global supplier of automotive safety systems and is key to our financial performance, because quality excellence is critical for winning new orders, preventing recalls and maintaining low scrap rates. Autoliv has for many years emphasized a “zero-defect” proactive quality policy and continues to strive to improve its working methods. This means both that Autoliv’s products are expected to always meet performance expectations, and that Autoliv’s products are expected to be delivered to its customers at the right times and in the right amounts. Furthermore, we believe our continued quality improvements further enhance our reputation among our customers, employees and governmental authorities.
 
Although quality has always been paramount in the automotive industry, especially for safety products, automobile manufacturers have become increasingly focused on quality with even less tolerance for any deviations. This intensified focus on quality is partially due to an increase in the number of vehicle recalls for a variety of reasons (not just safety), including a few high-profile vehicle recalls. This trend is likely to continue as automobile manufacturers introduce even stricter quality requirements and regulating agencies and other authorities increase the level of scrutiny given to vehicle safety issues. We have not been immune to the recalls that have been impacting the automotive industry.

We continue to drive our quality initiative called “Q5” which was initiated in the summer of 2010. It is an integral part of our strategy of shaping a proactive quality culture of zero defects. It is called “Q5” because it addresses quality in five dimensions: products, customers, growth, behavior and suppliers. The goal of Q5 is to firmly tie together quality with value within all of our processes and for all of our employees, thereby leading to the best value for our customers. Since 2010, we have continually expanded this quality initiative to provide additional skills training to more employees and suppliers. These activities have made a significant contribution to the reduction in occurrences of non-conforming events.
 
In our pursuit of excellence in quality, we have developed a chain of four “defense lines” against potential quality issues. These defense lines consist of: 1) robust product designs, 2) flawless components from suppliers and our own in-house component companies, 3) manufacturing flawless products with a system for verifying that our products conform with specifications and 4) an advanced traceability system in the event of a recall.
 
Our pursuit of excellence extends from the earliest phases of product development to the proper disposal of a product following many years of use in a vehicle. Autoliv’s comprehensive Autoliv Product Development System includes several key check points during the process of developing new products that are designed to ensure that such products are well-built and have no hidden defects. Through this process, we work closely with our suppliers and customers to set clear standards that help to ensure robust component design and lowest cost for function in order to proactively prevent problems and ensure we deliver only the best designs to the market.
 
The Autoliv Production System (“APS”), based on the goals of improving quality and efficiency, is at the core of Autoliv’s manufacturing philosophy. APS integrates essential quality elements, such as mistake proofing, statistical process control and operator involvement, into the manufacturing processes so all Autoliv associates are aware of and understand the critical connection between themselves and our lifesaving products. This “zero-defect” principle extends beyond Autoliv to the entire supplier base. All of our suppliers must accept the strict quality standards in the global Autoliv Supplier Manual, which defines our quality requirements and focuses on preventing bad parts from being produced by our suppliers and helps eliminate defective intermediate products in our assembly lines as early as possible. In addition, Autoliv’s One Product One Process (“1P1P”) initiative is our strategy for developing and managing standardization of both core products and customer-specific features, leading not only to improved quality, but also greater cost efficiency and more efficient supply chain management.
 
IATF 16949:2016 is the most rigorous global automotive quality requirements and all our facilities shipping to OEMs are regularly certified according to IAFT standards.
 
Environmental and Safety Regulations
 For information on how environmental and safety regulations impact our business, see “Risk Factors – ‘Our business may be adversely affected by laws or regulations, including environmental, occupational health and safety or other governmental regulations’ and ‘Our business may be adversely affected by changes in automotive safety regulations or concerns that drive further regulation of the automobile safety market’” in Item 1A and “Risks and Risk Management” in Item 7 of this Annual Report.
Raw Materials
 Approximately 50% of our revenues are spent on material purchased directly from external suppliers. Autoliv mainly purchases manufactured components and raw materials for the operations. We take several actions to mitigate higher raw material prices, such as competitive sourcing and looking for alternative materials.
 For information on the sources and availability of raw materials, see “Risk Factors – Changes in the source., cost, availability of and regulations pertaining to raw materials and components may adversely affect our profit margins” in Item 1A of this Annual Report.
Intellectual Property
 We have developed a considerable amount of proprietary technology related to automotive safety systems and rely on many patents to protect such technology. Our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets we serve. For information on our use of intellectual property and its importance to us, see “Risk Factors – If our patents are declared invalid or our technology infringes on the proprietary rights of others, our ability to compete may be impaired” in Item 1A of this Annual Report.
Seasonality and Backlog
 Autoliv’s business is not subject to significant seasonal fluctuations. Autoliv has frame contracts with automobile manufacturers and such contracts are typically entered into up to three years before the start of production of the relevant car model or platform and provide for a term covering the life of such car model or platform including service parts after a vehicle model is no longer produced. However, typically these contracts do not provide minimum quantities, firm prices or exclusivity but instead permit the automobile manufacturer to resource the relevant products at given intervals (or at any time) from other suppliers.

Dependence on Customers
 In 2018 our top five customers represented around 50% of sales and the ten largest customers represented around 79%. This reflects the concentration of manufacturers in the automotive industry. The five largest OEMs in 2018 accounted for 49% of global LVP and the ten largest OEMs for 74%. A delivery contract is typically for the lifetime of a vehicle model, which is normally between 4 and 6 years depending on customer platform sourcing preferences and strategies.

CUSTOMER SALES TRENDS
 Asian vehicle producers have steadily become increasingly more important to Autoliv, and now represent around 45% of global sales compared to 35% five years ago. Of the Asian OEMs, the Japanese OEMs represent 32% of our sales compared to 24% in 2013. This reflects their increasing share of the global LVP and our stronger market position based on our local presence in Japan. European OEMs accounted for 33% of sales in 2018, virtually unchanged since 2013. The Detroit-3 now account for 19% of our global sales, down from 30% in 2013 this is in part due to GM’s divestiture of Opel and the lingering effects of new business hold back in 2011 and 2012. 
 For information on our dependence on customers, see “Risk Factors – Our business could be materially and adversely affected if we lost any of our largest customers or if they were unable to pay their invoices” in Item 1A of this Annual Report and Dependence on Customers under the section Risks and Risk Management in Item 7 of this Annual Report and Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Research, Development and Engineering
 No single customer project accounts for more than 2% of Autoliv’s total R,D&E spending during 2018. To fuel Autoliv’s product portfolio, additional expertise is brought in-house via technology partnerships and licensing agreements.
 Information on research, development and engineering is included under section “Risks and Risk Management” in Item 7 of this Annual Report.
 
Regulatory Costs
 The fitting of seatbelts in most types of motor vehicles is mandatory in almost all countries and many countries have strict laws regarding the use of seatbelts while in vehicles. In addition, most developed countries require that seats in intercity buses and commercial vehicles be fitted with seatbelts. In the U.S., federal legislation requires frontal airbags on the driver-side and the passenger-side of all new passenger cars and in all new light vehicles, which are defined as vehicles with an unloaded vehicle weight of approximately 7,700 pounds or less.
 
For information concerning the material effects on our business relating to our compliance with government safety regulations, see “Risk Factors – ‘Our business may be adversely affected by laws or regulations, including environmental, occupational health and safety or other governmental regulations’ and ‘Our business may be adversely affected by changes in automotive safety regulations or concerns that drive further regulation of the automobile safety market’” in Item 1A of this Annual Report and in Item 7 under the section “Risks and Risk Management” of this Annual Report.
