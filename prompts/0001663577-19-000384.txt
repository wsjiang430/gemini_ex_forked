Item 1. Business 
Company Overview
 
AB International Group Corp. (the "Company", "we" or "us") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on July 29, 2013 ("Inception") and originally intended to purchase used cars in the United States and sell them in Krygyzstan. The Company's fiscal year end is August 31.
 
On January 22, 2016, our former sole officer, who owned 83% of our outstanding common shares, sold all of his common shares to unrelated investor Jianli Deng. After the stock sale, we modified our business to focus on the creation of a mobile app marketing engine. The app was designed for movie trailer promotions and we planned to generate a subscriber base of smartphone users primarily through pre-installed app smartphone makers, online app stores, WeChat official accounts, Weibo and other social network media outlets and sell prepaid cards or coins to movie distributors or other video advertisers in China. We created the app “Amoney” for the Android smartphone platform to develop a WeChat micro-shop that was designed to display and deliver a variety of information and links for download or online watch prices in the China market. 
 
On June 1, 2017, we entered into a Patent License Agreement (the “Agreement”) pursuant to which Guangzhou Shengshituhua Film and Television Company Limited, a company incorporated in China (“Licensor”), granted to us a worldwide license to a video synthesis and release system for mobile communications equipment (the “Technology”). The Technology is the subject of a utility model patent in the People’s Republic of China. Under the Agreement, we are able to utilize, improve upon, and sub-license the technology for an initial period of 5 years, subject to a right to renew for an additional 5 year term. We were obligated to pay the Licensor $500,000 within 30 days of the date of the Agreement and a royalty fee in the amount of 20% of any proceeds resulting from our utilization of the Technology, whether in the form of sub-licensing fees or sales of licensed products. Our Chief Executive Officer, Chiyuan Deng and former Chief Executive Officer, Jianli Deng, jointly own and control Licensor. On October 10, 2017, we completed the payment of all amounts due under the Agreement.
 
Our License to the Technology generates revenue through sub-license monthly fees from a smartphone app on Android devices. This app was already existing and licensed at the time we acquired the Technology. 
 
We are in the process of using the underlying Technology to create a smartphone video mix app and social video sharing platform. We are developing this new apps for use with iOS and Android smartphones and we expect to launch the app sometime in the beginning of next year. We expect that this new app will transform the way users create and share art talent and fun. The app is expected to take advantage of the core design philosophy of “My film anyone, anywhere, anytime be together.” Similar and competitive innovative video and community apps have been activated on over 2 million unique devices in China as of December 31, 2017 and precipitated the duet video synthesis phenomenon in China. Today, the word “Meitu” is used as a verb for “enhancing images”, amd TikTok is a short video sharing platform. Our Videomix app, yet to be released, is expected to be used as a verb for “enhancing videos synthesis production,” but also as a brand that represents talent, trendiness, youthfulness and funniness. 
 
To better meet our users’ demands for higher quality selfies, we are also planning to launch the Patent (Mobile communication equipment video synthesis production and distribution system) License Program. The program markets our Technology to big brand smartphones makers to highlight our patent apps integrate proprietary video synthesis production and distribution system processing algorithms and specialized video processors, which generate high-quality selfies duet video synthesis. We have been in discussion with these smartphone makers about our initiatives and selling points in an effort to increase sales. Revenue from this program will be generated by license fees for each smartphone with this video synthesis production and distribution system function. 
 
Fundamentally, we view ourselves as a mobile Internet company with our core asset being our massive, active and fast-growing user base through registered patent--Mobile communication equipment video synthesis production and distribution system. 
 
We believe that the VideoMix app will become an important part of users’ social lives online. We believe the provision of relevant products, content and services will help us monetize our user base and enable us to create value for our users at the same time. We intend to continue to drive our near-term revenue growth through patent--Mobile communication equipment video synthesis production and distribution system license fees from smartphone makers, since China’s large smartphone market continues to present significant opportunities. Our goal is that at least 10% of smartphones in China will eventually contain this integrated patent function. If we meet this goal, which would equate

to around 40 million smartphones, which in turn result in about 200 million RMB in revenue generated from patent license fees. As we have not yet commercialized the app for sale, we do not expect to achieve any revenues until we launch the app and make it available under our program, and we can provide no assurances that we will be able to achieve commercialization or our revenue goals for the app. According to preliminary data of the IDC Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker, the Chinese smartphone market shipped 105 million units during the second quarter of 2018. Following our successful monetization through smartphones, we have also identified three other major opportunities for monetization, including content use fees, advertising fees, KOL agency fees.

In December of 2018, we started developing a performance matching platform and a WeChat official account to advertise the platform. The matching platform is to arrange performance events for celebrities and performers. Performers can set their schedules and quotes on the platform. The platform will maximize their profits from performance events by optimizing their schedules based upon quotes and event locations and save time from commuting among different events. “Ai Bian Quan Qiu” utilizes the artificial intelligence (AI) matching technology to instantly and accurately match performers and advertisers or merchants.
