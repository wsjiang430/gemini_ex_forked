Competition
 
Currently, the market of consulting services in Thailand is quite actively developed. Presently, there are many companies that render similar services. We estimate the market of business consulting service in Thailand as low development market. We believe that the market has potential of growth especially for foreign investments. There are many companies which provide similar service separately (investment brokers, lawyers etc). However, in our personal estimation, there are lack of companies that offer complex of consulting service. We see our competitive advantages in complex of consulting service from business idea to realization and clients support on every step of its business development. We also see an advantage in our president's and director's business experience. She speaks foreign languages which helps her to find appropriate approach to our potential customers. In order to take up a more beneficial position on this market, we offer to organize a complex service approach, that is, to offer a service package from which the client could choose the best one. Moreover, we see an advantage in working remotely with the client.
