ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 Molecular Templates, Inc., or Molecular, is a clinical-stage oncology company focused on the discovery and development of differentiated, targeted, biologic therapeutics for cancer. Molecular utilizes its proprietary biologic drug platform to design and generate engineered toxin bodies, or ETBs, which Molecular believes provide a differentiated mechanism of action that may be beneficial in patients resistant to currently available cancer therapeutics. ETBs use a genetically engineered version of the Shiga-like Toxin A subunit, or SLTA, a ribosome inactivating bacterial protein. In its wild-type form, SLT is thought to induce its own entry into a cell when proximal to the cell surface membrane, self-route to the cytosol, and enzymatically and irreversibly shut down protein synthesis via ribosome inactivation. SLTA is normally coupled to its cognate Shiga-like Toxin B subunit, or SLTB, to target the CD77 cell surface marker, a non-internalizing glycosphingolipid. In Molecular’s scaffold, a genetically engineered SLTA subunit with no cognate SLTB component is genetically fused to antibody domains or fragments specific to a cancer target, resulting in a biologic therapeutic that can identify the particular target and specifically kill the cancer cell. The antibody domains may be substituted with other antibody domains having different specificities to allow for the rapid development of new drugs to selected targets in cancer. 
 ETBs combine the specificity of an antibody with SLTA’s potent mechanism of cell destruction. Based on the disease setting, Molecular has created ETBs that have reduced immunogenicity and are capable of delivering additional payloads into a target cell. Immunogenicity is the ability of a foreign substances to provoke an immune response in a host. ETBs have relatively predictable pharmacokinetic, or PK, and absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion, or ADME, profiles and can be rapidly screened for desired activity in robust cell-based and animal-model assays. Because SLTA can induce internalization against non- and poorly-internalizing receptors, the universe of targets for ETBs should be substantially larger than that seen with antibody-drug conjugates, or ADCs, which are not likely to be effective if the target does not readily internalize the ADC payload. 
 ETBs have a differentiated mechanism of cell-kill in cancer therapeutics (the inhibition of protein synthesis via ribosome destruction), and Molecular has preclinical and clinical data demonstrating the utility of these molecules in chemotherapy-refractory cancers. ETBs have shown good safety data in multiple animal models as well as in Molecular’s clinical studies to date. Molecular believes the target specificity of ETBs, their ability to self-internalize, their potent and differentiated mechanism of cell kill and their safety profile provide opportunities for the clinical development of these agents to address multiple cancer types. 
 Molecular’s initial approach to drug development in oncology involves the selection of lead compounds to validated targets in cancer. Molecular has developed ETBs for various targets, including CD20, CD38, HER2, and PD-L1. CD20 is central to B cell malignancies and is clinically validated as a target for the treatment of lymphomas and autoimmune disease. CD38 has been validated as a meaningful clinical target in the treatment of multiple myeloma. PD-L1 is central to immune checkpoint pathways and is a target expressed in a variety of solid tumor cancers. Molecular’s lead compound, MT-3724, is an ETB that recognizes CD20, a B cell marker and is currently in multiple phase II studies. The Phase I program consisted of a dose escalation portion, followed by a Phase Ib expansion cohort. Molecular recently initiated two Phase II studies for MT-3724, one monotherapy study that has the potential to be pivotal and a combination study with chemotherapy. Molecular expects to initiate a second combination study with Revlimid in the second quarter of 2019. Molecular expect two new ETBs, MT-5111 and TAK-169 to enter clinical trials in 2019. Molecular also expects to file an IND for its PD-L1 targeted ETB in the second half of 2019. 
 Molecular has built up multiple core competencies around the creation and development of ETBs. Molecular developed the ETB technology in-house and continues to make iterative improvements in the scaffold and identify new uses of the technology. Molecular also developed the proprietary process for manufacturing ETBs under Good Manufacturing Process, or GMP standards and continues to make improvements to its manufacturing processes. Molecular has conducted multiple GMP manufacturing runs with its lead compound and believes this process is robust and could support commercial production with gross margins that are similar to those seen with antibodies.

Challenges in Oncology 
 Existing mechanisms of action, the specific biochemical interaction through which a drug substance produces its pharmacological effect, are subject to numerous limitations in oncology. The clinical benefit of a given drug is a function of the biological properties of the drug, the target with which the drug interacts and the tumor indication being treated, but the relative contribution of each of these factors is difficult to separate. To date, significant challenges exist in identifying the most appropriate cancer targets, applying the most effective mechanisms of action and selecting the appropriate disease indications and most responsive patient populations for a particular drug. These challenges, including the following: 

• | Availability of viable targets. The limited number of cancer targets addressable with currently available mechanisms of action; for example, targets appropriate for ADC approaches are relegated to those extracellular targets that already readily and efficiently self-internalize;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Drug resistance. ADC approaches generally use chemotherapy payloads which damage DNA, or disrupt or prevent microtubule assembly, and can be subject to the same mechanisms of resistance as in general chemotherapy;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Limits of monotherapy. Established single-agent therapies are only effective in a minority of cancer patients;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Target identification and prioritization. Current approaches to target prioritization are not comprehensively systematic and do not leverage a complete understanding of a drug’s effect on a given tumor type to best identify high value targets in certain patient populations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Clinical predictability of preclinical data. In vitro epitope selection on a given target may not be predictive of clinical optimization; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Biomarker use and utility. Predictive biomarkers, the value and use of which are relatively new, are not uniformly used to proactively select responsive patient populations and/or preferred indications, which can drive longer development timelines with higher associated costs.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Molecular’s Differentiated Approach 
 Molecular was founded on the principle that differentiated mechanisms of action are crucial for improving outcomes in oncology. Molecular has created a new ETB scaffold with a differentiated mechanism of action, coupled with a predictable PK and ADME profile. Molecular’s ETB scaffold permits rapid screening for lead identification and easily scalable production, which Molecular believes offers an opportunity to provide meaningful clinical benefits in oncology with more cost efficient research and development than current treatments. Molecular believes the differentiated biological activity inherent to the ETB scaffold, particularly the ability to induce internalization and employ a differentiated mechanism of cell kill, may allow for differentiated clinical benefit in patients as monotherapy and in combination with standard of care therapies. 
 Molecular likens the extensive de-immunization work it has conducted on SLTA to the chimerization of monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibody chimerization is a process for reducing immunogenicity when an antibody from one species is introduced into a different species. Chimerization has allowed for the wide-spread use of antibodies as human therapeutics across multiple disease settings. Molecular believes that the de-immunization of SLTA may allow for ETB use across multiple indications in oncology, including solid tumors, as well as other potential non-oncology indications. 
 Molecular has seen in both preclinical models and in its Phase I trials to date that the differentiated mechanism of action employed by its ETBs can be effective in chemo-resistant tumor cells. Molecular believes this creates the potential for a rapid characterization of efficacy in carefully designed clinical trials in relapsed and refractory settings, particularly when targeting tumor markers that persist after treatment with multiple lines of therapy and whose targeting has been shown to provide a survival benefit. Molecular also has seen preclinically that its ETBs can have additive or synergistic activity in combination with a number of small molecule agents including chemotherapeutics, immunomodulatory agents and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Molecular believes that the ability of ETBs to be additive or synergistic to a variety of current treatments may allow for combination therapy in earlier lines of disease.

Molecular believes it can develop ETBs against well-validated targets and new targets, enabling a phenotypically based clinical trial design that may result in shorter development timelines with lower associated costs. More specifically: 
  
• | Molecular’s research and design platform allows it to select lead ETBs from a comprehensive screen. Molecular’s ETB platform utilizes a suite of integrated technologies to screen ETB libraries for lead identification. Molecular performs initial preclinical screens on ETBs with lead selection around potency, affinity and expression. Critical components of Molecular’s approach include:
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | the proprietary optimization of the genetic fusion between the immunoglobulin-targeting domain and Molecular’s proprietary SLTA scaffold;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | the proprietary de-immunizing modifications made to the SLTA scaffold, which reduce both adaptive and innate immune responses to ETBs;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | comprehensive screening for potency, affinity and specificity against target expressing versus non-expressing cells; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | early evaluation of protein expression and stability of potential lead ETB candidates.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Molecular’s ability to create lead ETBs to well-validated targets reduces the risk of target-mediated side effects and increases the likelihood of obtaining meaningful clinical benefit. Molecular has deployed its technology against targets in oncology that are central to disease progression and that are known to persist after a given modality has failed. Molecular believes these targets reduce the risk of clinical failure from either unacceptable target-mediated adverse events or from a failure to impact disease outcome because of loss of the target. For example, Molecular’s lead compound, MT-3724, targets the B-cell surface marker CD20. CD20 appears central to B-cell malignancies, and the FDA has approved multiple antibody therapies targeting CD20. Destruction of CD20-expressing cells has been generally safe and has not been found to cause significant damage to the patient, known as severe toxicity. CD20 cell surface expression persists in the majority of patients who have progressed after treatment with a CD20 monoclonal antibody. Molecular chose targeting of CD20 for Molecular’s lead ETB program because of its known lack of internalization upon antibody binding, centrality to disease progression, lack of associated toxicities and persistence after treatment failure. Molecular used a similar rationale in the selection of Molecular’s current pipeline, including ETBs targeting CD38, HER2, and PD-L1, which are targets central to disease outcome that persist after a given modality has failed.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Molecular’s ETB platform allows Molecular to identify ETBs to targets and select patients in the Phase I clinical trials that phenotypically match that ETB program. Molecular can screen a library of single chain variable fragments, or scFvs, expressed in Molecular’s ETB scaffold to a given target. The pharmacokinetic and ADME profile of these compounds are similar and relatively predictive in humans based on animal models. Once the lead is selected and Investigational New Drug Application, or IND-enabling studies are completed, Molecular can enrich a Phase I clinical trial with only patients expressing the target of the ETB. In these Phase I clinical trials, Molecular can get a faster read on safety as well as efficacy than is possible in many drug development programs. Molecular’s Phase I trial in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma with MT-3724 established the PK, ADME, dose-limiting toxicities, or DLTs, maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, and recommended Phase II dose and monotherapy efficacy after just 21 patients were treated.

Molecular’s Strategy 
 Molecular’s goal is to bring the right ETBs to the right patients to provide long-lasting benefits that ultimately improve patients’ lives. To achieve its goal, Molecular is: 

• | Implementing development strategies that capitalize on the differentiated pharmacological features of Molecular’s ETB technology and the validated nature of the targets it has chosen. Molecular believes the target specificity of its ETBs, their ability to self-internalize, their potent and differentiated mechanism of cell kill and their safety profiles will provide opportunities for the clinical development of these agents to address multiple cancer types. For example, Molecular is aggressively developing its lead product MT-3724 as a single agent therapy for relapsed and refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL, patients and in combination with approved therapies in earlier stages of high-risk DLBCL. The targeting of CD20 with antibody therapeutics is known to confer clinical benefit in these settings. MT-3724’s differentiated mechanism of action, safety and pharmacological profiles targeting CD20 may provide an advantage over other modalities. Given the unique mechanism of direct cell-kill, via ribosome inactivation, Molecular believes there is the potential for combination or sequential drug strategies that may be unique to its ETB drug candidates. Further, based on MT-3724 safety

data to date, Molecular believes the different PK and ADME profiles of its ETBs may allow them to be more appropriate therapies for certain patient populations, particularly those who are unable to tolerate intensive chemotherapy as primary or conditioning therapy. For example, in the Phase I clinical trial for MT-3724, the median age was 67 and the median number of prior therapies was four. Molecular believes all of these attributes will enable Molecular to pursue development strategies not feasible with other therapeutic approaches.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Efficiently building a broad pipeline of ETB therapeutics targeting defined patient populations through the use of Molecular’s research and design platform. Molecular believes its research and design platform is an efficient and productive discovery and development engine that can identify new targets across multiple cell types with the aim of creating a portfolio of novel, cell targeting ETBs. By selecting tumor targets best suited to ETB biology, Molecular can prioritize indications, including potential niche indications and/or niche subsets of indications. Molecular believes this will enable the identification of patients who may be more likely to respond to its therapies, allowing Molecular to potentially shorten development timelines and lower associated costs.

• | Maximizing the value of Molecular’s early pipeline through the continual improvement of Molecular’s technology. Since its founding, Molecular has made substantial progress in improving its ETB technology. Molecular has created a proprietary SLTA that has been heavily modified to dramatically reduce innate and adaptive immunogenicity. In addition, new approaches have been developed for the genetic fusion of the SLTA and antibody domain that enhances the potency of Molecular’s ETBs. Molecular has also developed ETBs that have the ability to deliver foreign class I antigens into target cells for expression in complex with MHC class I molecules on the target cell’s surface. Molecular has shown preclinically that certain foreign antigens can be functionally recognized by endogenous human T-cells thereby enabling a potentially new and differentiated approach to immuno-oncology.

• | Building a fully integrated discovery-to-commercial oncology company focused on compounds with unique and differentiated biology. Molecular believes that differentiated mechanisms of action are crucial for improving outcomes in oncology. Molecular has created a robust translational platform that Molecular believes allows it to create a sustainable, novel pipeline of ETBs with differentiated mechanisms of tumor destruction, relatively predictable PK and ADME, and scalable and economical manufacturing. If MT-3724, MT-111, or any future product candidates Molecular may develop are approved, Molecular will consider commercializing them itself in select markets.

Molecular’s Engineered Toxin Body (ETB) Platform Technology 
 Although chemotherapy remains the cornerstone of treatment for most cancers, the advent of new and targeted classes of therapies has dramatically changed outcomes in the treatment of disease. The advent of monoclonal antibodies, signal transduction inhibitors and, most recently, immune-oncologics have provided substantial clinical benefit in both the relapsed and refractory setting and, when used in combinations, in earlier lines of therapy. Molecular believes that ETBs represent a new class of targeted agents with differentiated biology that are well-positioned to improve outcomes in cancer patients. 
 ETBs appear to induce the internalization of non- or poorly-internalizing targets, have a differentiated mechanism of action (enzymatic and irreversible ribosome inactivation), have relatively predictable PK and ADME profiles and can be readily manufactured to GMP standards. From a library of antibody targeting domains, Molecular’s research and design platform allows for the comprehensive (six to eight weeks) in vitro selection of a lead ETB to a given target based on affinity and specificity, potency and expression. Lead selection is confirmed through the use of animal models to verify PK, ADME and potency. ETBs possess potent direct cell killing effects via a differentiated mechanism of action, can force receptor internalization, and can be used to deliver payloads such as foreign class I antigen to the cytosol. MT-3724, Molecular’s lead ETB candidate, is being developed for treating B-cell malignancies and utilizes the wild-type SLTA. Because of the immune-compromised nature of patients with B-cell malignances, Molecular did not believe de-immunization of SLTA was critical in these patients; this hypothesis has been supported by clinical data in DLBCL patients. 
 In subsequent ETBs, Molecular utilizes a highly potent and proprietarily de-immunized SLTA scaffold that elicits significantly reduced innate and adaptive immunogenic responses as demonstrated in preclinical and animal studies (presented at the 2017 American Association for Cancer Research, or AACR, Annual Meeting). For indications where tumors have been demonstrated to be sensitive to T-cell engagement, Molecular has developed ETBs that deliver foreign class I viral antigens for presentation on the surface of the tumor: Molecular’s Antigen Seeding Technology (AST), a differentiated approach to immune-oncology. Molecular is currently building out animal models to further validate and screen ETB candidates support this approach.

Molecular believes that its proprietary ETB technology platform represents a differentiated approach in oncology. ETBs possess the targeting specificity of antibody-based therapeutic approaches but deliver highly potent payloads that disrupt protein synthesis, a fundamental function of a cancer cell, in a manner not subject to traditional chemotherapy resistance mechanisms or target internalization limitations, as with ADCs. Molecular is also seeking to expand the universe of potential targets subject to pharmaceutical treatments by exploiting the ETB’s ability to force internalization against receptors that do not normally internalize to. MT-3724 highlights this capability and approach. MT-3724 targets CD20, which is a canonical non-internalizing receptor that is not susceptible to traditional chemo-based ADC approaches. 
 Novel mechanisms of action are needed in oncology treatment, and Molecular believes that its ETB platform technology’s differentiated mechanisms of action may offer unique benefits over existing treatment modalities. 
 ETB Product Pipeline 
 Molecular is developing a pipeline of ETBs that Molecular believes will provide a meaningful and long-lasting benefit to cancer patients. Molecular plans to develop each of these as single agents and/or in combination with other therapies, as applicable. The following table depicts Molecular’s current pipeline: 
MT-3724—ETB Targeting CD20 
 Overview 
 CD20 is expressed on 90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, or NHL, cells and is a non-internalizing receptor. Rituxan (rituximab), an antibody to CD20, is approved for treatment of NHL in both the front and second-line settings. Rituxan has limited direct cell-kill effects against CD20-expressing cells. Instead, it works through indirect methods of recruiting immune responses to CD20-expressing cells through antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, or ADCC, and/or complement dependent cytotoxicity, or CDC. Rituxan’s indirect cell-kill mechanism’s reliance on a favorable tumor microenvironment for immune stimulation is problematic because it allows opportunities for resistance to emerge. Therefore, direct cell-kill approaches that target CD20-expressing lymphomas are attractive. Two such agents are currently approved: the radioisotope-conjugated antibodies Bexxar, developed by GlaxoSmithKline, and Zevalin, developed by IDEC Pharmaceuticals (now part of Biogen), both of which use ionizing radiation to induce direct cell-kill without internalization being necessary. These radioisotope conjugated antibodies are more effective than naked anti-CD20 antibody approaches such as Rituxan and HuMax-CD20 in the relapsed or refractory indolent NHL setting because they are far less dependent on the physiology of the tumor. However, despite their favorable efficacy profile, Bexxar and Zevalin are considered commercial disappointments and have not been widely adopted by oncologists primarily due to the constraints associated with the administration of nuclear medicines. Radioimmunotherapies are difficult to administer, with few institutions licensed for nuclear medicine. Because of these factors, the combined use of Bexxar and Zevalin accounted for only a minimal share of all administered second-line therapies for indolent NHL patients worldwide (seven major markets) despite superior clinical data in this setting. Bexxar was subsequently taken off the market in 2013. Molecular believes this provides a significant opportunity for a CD20-targeting therapy, such as MT-3724, that directly kills cells without the use of radioisotopes, and utilizes a mechanism of action of cell kill that is not subject to cross-resistance with chemotherapy or antibody approaches.

MT-3724 is a ETB specific to the B-cell marker CD20 protein. Molecular developed MT-3724 to provide a non-radioactive means of direct cell-kill targeted to CD20 for the treatment of NHL. The differentiated mechanism of action of MT-3724 involves binding to the surface protein CD20, forcing internalization into the target cell, retrograde transport to the cytosol and subsequent enzymatic and permanent ribosome-inactivation. Following the completion of the Phase I dose escalation trial in 2017, Molecular conducted a Phase Ib expansion trial of MT-3724 in patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL. Molecular recently initiated a Phase II monotherapy study that has the potential to be pivotal as well as a Phase II study of MT-3724 in combination with chemotherapy in earlier lines of DLBCL. In the second quarter of 2019, Molecular is also planning to a Phase II study of MT-3724 in combination with Revlimid.
 Clinical Overview 
 MT-3724 is being developed for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory NHL who have failed one or more chemotherapeutics and anti-CD20 antibody therapies and for whom all other approved therapies (biologic, chemotherapeutic or stem cell transplantation) are not an option. The primary objectives of the multicenter Phase I clinical trial of MT-3724 was to assess the tolerability of MT-3724 and to establish the maximum tolerated dose, or MTD of the drug. The secondary objectives of the Phase I clinical trial were to assess the pharmacokinetic profile of MT-3724 after intravenous dosing as well as to assess any biological and clinical activity. This Phase I clinical trial was not designed to show statistical significance of the study endpoints. 
 Molecular initially filed an IND application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, on July 31, 2014, and Molecular received the notification from the FDA that it could proceed with the Phase I trial on August 29, 2014 with the first patient dosed in March of 2015. The Phase I trial was a multi-center, open-label, multiple-dose Phase I, dose-escalation study of MT-3724 in subjects with relapsed, refractory B-cell NHL or chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL. A total of 21 patients were treated with MT-3724 with doses ranging from 5 to 100 mcg/kg. Patients were dosed 3 times per week over two weeks (6 doses) followed by a two-week hiatus for the first cycle, as mandated by the FDA. Subsequent cycles were dosed over two weeks with a one-week hiatus. Originally, up to five cycles of treatment were allowed per protocol. This was subsequently amended to allow for extended dosing beyond five cycles. 
 Twenty-one patients were treated with escalating doses of MT-3724 starting at the 5 mcg/kg dose level. Nearly all patients experienced at least one adverse event, with peripheral edema, diarrhea, myalgia, cough, fatigue, constipation, nausea, anemia, stomatitis, pyrexia, dizziness, headache, insomnia, dyspnea, being the more commonly reported adverse events. During the study, there were no treatment-related deaths. 
 The first two patients treated in the 100 mcg/kg/dose cohort developed signs and symptoms of a systemic inflammatory response (a constellation of adverse events including a grade 2 decrease in serum albumin levels, which together were consistent with capillary leak syndrome) in the first cycle of treatment. Upon thorough evaluation of each case, the Data Monitoring Committee, or DMC, deemed the capillary leak syndrome the DLT and determined that the 100 mcg/kg/dose had exceeded the MTD and the cohort was closed to further enrollment. The symptoms related to the DLT were non-life threatening and resolved upon cessation of dosing MT-3724. Six patients were dosed at a reduced dose level of 75 mcg/kg cohort with no DLTs reported. Upon identifying 75 mcg/kg as the maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, the recommended Phase Ib/II dose was designated to be 75 mcg/kg. 
 To date, 31 serious adverse events, or SAEs have been reported. Most these events were attributed to exacerbation of a pre-existing condition or disease progression. Both subjects in the 100 mcg/kg/dose cohort were withdrawn in cycle 1 for SAEs which the investigator and DMC assessed as DLTs and determined that the MTD had been exceeded. 
 Molecular has observed promising signals of single-agent activity with MT-3724. Patients in the Phase I trial were of older age (median age = 67) and heavily pre-treated, with a median of four prior therapies. Those patients with ≤ four prior therapies (n=5) were generally chemo-intolerant patients who could not sustain multiple lines of chemo-based regiments. The majority of patients were of the DLBCL subtype (n=15). Of the 14 evaluable DLBCL patients who received MT-3724, eight patients entered the trial with low levels of serum anti-CD20 antibody while six patients had high levels of anti-CD20 antibody. As reported in Molecular’s presentation to the 2016 American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting, or the 2016 ASH Meeting, patients with high anti-CD20 antibody did not respond to MT-3724, presumably due to target inaccessibility. In the eight DLBCL patients with low anti-CD20 antibody, the observed objective response rate, or ORR, was 25% (2/8) including a partial response, or PR, and a complete metabolic response, or CMR. Molecular observed clinical responses starting at the lowest dose level of 5 mcg/kg as shown in Figure 4. The patient who achieved a CMR was eligible for and received an allogeneic stem cell transplant, or SCT. Three patients had stable disease, or SD, with tumor reductions of 19% 
 9


(10 mcg/kg), 48% (75 mcg/kg), and 49% (100 mcg/kg), respectively. The patient at 100 mcg/kg with 49% tumor reduction had received only a single dose of MT-3724 at the time of measurement. The remaining three patients had progressive disease, or PD. Notably, three of the eight DLBCL patients received fewer than two cycles of MT-3724 due to early withdrawal from the study (including the two patients at the DLT dose of 100 mcg/kg). Significant ADAs were not observed among DLBCL patients and did not appear to neutralize the efficacy of MT-3724 in patients.

----------+---------------------------------------------------------


Based on the clinical effect observed among DLBCL patients, Molecular opened a Phase Ib expansion study to further explore the potential of MT-3724 in DLBCL. A brief update on the first three patients dosed in the MT-3724 Phase Ib expansion was delivered at the World ADC Summit Europe on March 28, 2018. Observations included the following:    
  
• | One patient was assessed in a partial response (PR) after the first dose of MT-3724. The PR was confirmed at the end of cycle 2 per protocol and the patient remains on study with continued dosing of MT-3724. The other patients were assessed as stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD). 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A dose interruption and reduction was required in 2 of the first 3 patients in Phase Ib expansion (including the patient with the PR). These patients had high body weights, which resulted in high absolute doses of MT-3724 based on 75 mcg/kg dosing. The adverse events observed (grade 2 and 3 headache, arthralgia, and myalgia) were non-life threatening and dosing resumed at 50 mcg/kg dose, which and has been generally well tolerated.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Based on these data and the clinical activity of MT-3724 observed at doses as low as 5 mcg/kg, a decision was made to define the MTD of MT-3724 as 50 mcg/kg with a maximum total drug per dose of 6 mg.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Molecular has since enrolled additional patients at the 50 mcg/kg dose. Molecular recently initiated a Phase II monotherapy DLBCL study that has the potential to be pivotal. 
 Furthermore, Molecular is developing MT-3724 in earlier lines of therapy in combination with chemotherapy and non-chemotherapy based regiments.  Molecular recently initiated a Phase IIa study combining MT-3724 with a chemo regimen in transplant-ineligible DLBCL patients.  Additionally, a second Phase IIa study evaluating MT-3724 in combination with Revlimid in DLBCL patients is planned to begin in the second quarter of 2019.   
 Recent Presentations 
 MT-3724 AACR presentation: In April 2017, Molecular presented preclinical data for Molecular’s MT-3724 lead compound at the AACR annual conference. MT-3724 is an ETB with wild-type SLTA and is not de-immunized. Nevertheless, to date, Molecular has not seen a high level of neutralizing antibodies in patients treated with MT-3724, likely because of the nature of their disease (B-cell malignancy) and their prior therapies (B-cell depleting agents), which leave these patients with compromised immune systems. The MT-3724 presentation at AACR demonstrated the reduction in anti-drug antibodies, or ADAs, seen when MT-3724 was co-administered with sirolimus in both murine and non-human primate, or NHP, models. These data may be useful in guiding clinical development of MT-3724 if significant levels of ADAs are seen in patients treated with MT-3724. Additionally, researchers at MD Anderson Cancer Center presented preclinical data on MT-3724 potency against mantle cell lymphoma samples. Researchers demonstrated a substantial survival advantage in a xenograft model using a patient-derived mantle cell lymphoma.

TAK-169—ETB Targeting CD38 
 Overview 
 CD38 is a single-chain type II transmembrane glycoprotein that is expressed by a variety of hematologic cells in an activation- and differentiation-dependent manner. Its cellular functions are involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and survival. CD38 is expressed at high rates on patient myeloma samples, making it an important marker and potential target in the development of targeted biologics. 
 Daratumumab (trade name Darzalex®) received FDA approval for the treatment of multiple myeloma in 2015. Daratumumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds CD38 on multiple myeloma cells and induces cell death indirectly. Approval was supported by a Phase II pivotal trial in fourth line myeloma patients and subsequent randomized studies in earlier lines of myeloma therapy.  A careful analysis of this study’s results reveals that CD38 expression persists after patients have progressed on daratumumab and that the myeloma cells of patients who relapsed after daratumumab treatment showed an increase in cell surface receptors (CD55 and CD59) that inhibit daratumumab’s ability to recruit an immune response to the myeloma cells (Nijhof et al., 2016). Persistence of a surface marker that is central to disease strongly suggests that a different modality targeting that surface marker and that is not cross-resistant to antibody therapy may provide substantial clinical benefit in myeloma. 
 Despite cell specific expression, an ADC, approach to CD38 has not been developed, likely because CD38 does not efficiently internalize, thereby limiting the amount of drug that could be delivered to myeloma cells. Because SLTA can force its own internalization and enzymatically inhibit ribosome function thereby killing the cell, Molecular theorized that the engineering of a potent and specific ETB targeted to CD38 could overcome the lack of internalization seen with CD38. 
 Molecular was developing MT-4019, an ETB that specifically targets CD38. Upon signing the collaboration agreement with Takeda in September 2018, TAK-169, an ETB that was jointly discovered with Takeda became the lead CD38 ETB. The compound was evaluated in many of the same preclinical assays as daratumumab. Daratumumab is an anti-cancer drug originally developed by Genmab. The mechanism of action of TAK-169 is wholly different than daratumumab, and Molecular believes that TAK-169 may be active in CD38+ myeloma patients that have failed treatment with an anti-CD38 antibody. 
 The proposed development plan for TAK-169 is modeled on that of daratumumab. After a robust response rate in its Phase I trial, daratumumab was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation, and its expanded Phase II trial (N=106) was considered sufficient for registration. If similar efficacy is seen with TAK-169, Molecular believes it may be possible to pursue a similar accelerated approval strategy via a Phase II clinical trial.    
 Preclinical Data with TAK-169
 TAK-169 Structure 
 TAK-169 utilizes Molecular’s updated scaffold in which the fusion of the scFv to the SLTA has been optimized and in which the SLTA portion of the ETB has been de-immunized. TAK-169 has high affinity for the CD38 receptor and potent and specific cell-kill activity against CD38-expressing cells.

De- immunized SLTA scaffold 
 The host immune response to bacterial proteins used in the treatment of solid tumors has historically prevented prolonged dosing and limited the utility of immunotoxins as a class of molecules. There has been much greater success with immunotoxins in hematological malignancies, as patients tend to be immunosuppressed due both to the nature of their disease and the drugs used in treatment (Kreitman et al., 2006). Multiple myeloma patients show a decreased immune response to bacterial proteins (Jacobson, et al., 1986), and Molecular has further reduced the likelihood of high levels of neutralizing antibodies by using its proprietary de-immunized SLTA, as shown in Molecular’s MT-4019 presentation at the 2017 AACR Annual Meeting. TAK-169 also utilizes Molecular’s de-immunized SLTA scaffold.
 Clinical and Regulatory Plan 
 Molecular has begun to pursue GMP manufacturing for MT-TAK-169. Molecular has substantial expertise with the GMP manufacture of ETBs based on its successful production of MT-3724. Molecular has a non-GMP facility in-house and has conducted seven GMP campaigns with MT-3724. From its experience with MT-3724, Molecular believes it can transfer expression of TAK-169 and complete manufacturing for GLP toxicity studies within six months. Based on expression and process improvements, TAK-169 is expected to have similar or better yields than MT-3724.
 Molecular and Takeda initiated IND-enabling studies to fully characterize TAK-169 based on toxicology and pharmacology in 2018. Molecular and Takeda expect to initiate a Phase I clinical trial for TAK-169 in 2019. Molecular was awarded a $15.2 million grant from CPRIT for the development of CD38 targeted ETBs. 
 Upcoming Presentations 
 TAK-169 AACR presentation. Molecular Templates plans to present on its CD38-targeted ETB, TAK-169 at the AACR Meeting in April 2019. TAK-169 has demonstrated potent cytotoxicity across a range of myeloma cell lines with a range of CD38 expression in vitro as well as in patient-derived samples including those with previous exposure to daratumumab. Furthermore, TAK-169 retains activity in the presence of excess approved, CD38 targeted therapeutic daratumumab. In xenograft models, complete regressions were observed using both a weekly and bi-weekly schedule of TAK-169. Tolerability studies in non-human primates demonstrate that repeat administration is tolerated at doses that are expected to be efficacious. 
 ETB Pipeline 
 Molecular has launched additional programs against the key targets HER2 and PD-L1. Molecular selected HER2 as a target because of its validated role in breast cancer. Targeting HER2 with different modalities (antibody, small molecule and ADC) has shown clinical benefit, and the target is known to persist after a given modality has failed. The clinical results seen with Kadcyla (an ADC to HER2) strongly suggests that a direct cell-kill approach to HER2 can provide significant benefit and be well tolerated in patients. Molecular believes that attacking HER2-expressing tumor cells with a differentiated mechanism of destruction may provide meaningful clinical benefits, even in patients whose disease has progressed on other HER2-targeted modalities. Molecular’s lead HER2 ETB, MT-5111, has shown potent picomolar activity in Kadcyla insensitive HER2+ cell lines and has shown additive or synergistic benefit with Kadcyla in vitro in HER2+ cell lines. 
 PD-L1 is a focal point for immuno-oncology checkpoint antibodies; its expression on tumors is known to downregulate CD8 T-cell activity against tumor cells. In Molecular’s ETB program targeting the PD-L1 receptor, Molecular has focused on targeting PD-L1 with a direct cell-kill approach rather than using it to induce an immune response. In addition, Molecular has integrated its Antigen Seeding Technology to the PD-L1 targeting ETB in order to induce targeted tumors to express CMV antigen in context with MHC-I on the tumor cell surface thereby redirecting an endogenous CMV-specific T-cell response to the tumor.  Molecular believes that targeting PD-L1 expressing tumors via this dual mechanism of ribosome-inactivation and redirected immunity via CMV-specific T-cell response represents a novel mechanism of action against PD-L1 expressing tumors.

ETB Research & Development Partnerships 
 Takeda Pharmaceuticals 
 Takeda Collaboration and Individual Project Agreements
 In October 2016, we 
entered into a collaboration and option agreement with Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd., or Takeda, to discover and develop CD38-targeting ETBs, which included MT-4019 for evaluation by Takeda (the “Takeda Collaboration Agreement”). Under the terms of the agreement, we were responsible for providing to Takeda (i) new ETBs generated using Takeda’s proprietary fully human antibodies targeting CD38 and (ii) MT-4019 for in vitro and in vivo pharmacological and anti-tumor efficacy evaluations. We granted Takeda an exclusive option to negotiate an exclusive worldwide license agreement to develop and commercialize any ETB that may result from this collaboration, including MT-4019. We were entitled to receive up to $2.0 million in technology access fees and cost reimbursement associated with our performance and completion of our obligations under the agreement. To date, we have received $2.0 million under this agreement.
 In connection with the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, we entered into an Individual Project Agreement (the “Takeda Individual Project Agreement”) with Takeda in June 2018 that was subsequently amended in July 2018.  Under the Takeda Individual Project Agreement, we are responsible to perform certain research and development services relating to Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (“CMC”) work for three potential lead ETBs targeting CD38.  In consideration of these services, we will receive up to $2.2 million in compensation.

 Takeda License Agreement
 On September 18, 2018, we entered into a development collaboration and exclusive license agreement (the “License Agreement”) with Takeda for the development and commercialization of products incorporating or comprised of one or more CD38 SLT-A fusion proteins (“Licensed Products”) for the treatment of patients with diseases such as multiple myeloma.
 Pursuant to the License Agreement, we will initially co-develop with Takeda one or more of the Licensed Products up to and including Phase Ia clinical trials, with us having an option to continue to co-develop the Licensed Products following Phase Ia clinical trials. We may exercise our co-development option within a specified time period following completion of the Phase Ia clinical trials with no additional fee by providing written notice of exercise to Takeda, provided we have paid all co-development costs due pursuant to the License Agreement as of the date of such exercise. Pursuant to the terms of the License Agreement, Takeda will be responsible for all regulatory activities and commercialization of the Licensed Products. We have granted Takeda specified intellectual property licenses to enable Takeda to perform its obligations and exercise its rights under the License Agreement, including exclusive license grants to enable Takeda to conduct development, manufacturing, and commercialization activities pursuant to the terms of the License Agreement.
 Pursuant to the License Agreement, Takeda made an upfront payment of $30.0 million to us. In addition to the upfront fee, if we exercise our co-development option and fund our share of development costs, we may receive up to an additional $307.5 million in milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestone events and up to an additional $325 million in milestone payments upon the achievement of certain sales milestone events. If we do not exercise our co-development option, we may receive up to an additional $162.5 million in milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestone events and up to an additional $175 million in milestone payments upon the achievement of certain sales milestone events. We will also be entitled to receive tiered royalties, subject to certain reductions, as percentages of annual aggregate net sales, if any, of Licensed Products. The royalty percentages would range from low double-digits to low twenties if we exercise our option to co-develop, and from high-single digits to low teens if we do not exercise its option to co-develop.
 The parties will share in co-development costs in accordance with the terms of the License Agreement, and Takeda will be responsible for all costs incurred commercializing the Licensed Products.
 Unless earlier terminated, the License Agreement will expire upon the expiration of the last-to-expire co-development royalty term (or royalty term, if applicable) for a Licensed Product. Takeda has the right to terminate the License Agreement at any time upon no less than ninety days’ prior written notice to us. We or Takeda may, subject to specified cure periods, terminate the License Agreement in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach, and either party may terminate the License Agreement under specified circumstances relating to the other party’s insolvency.
 13


Takeda Multi-Target Agreement
 In June 2017, we entered into a Multi-Target Collaboration and License Agreement with Takeda (“Takeda Multi-Target Agreement”) in which we agreed to collaborate with Takeda to identify and generate ETBs, against two targets designated by Takeda. Takeda designated certain targets of interest as the focus of the research. Each party granted to the other nonexclusive rights in its intellectual property for purposes of the conduct of the research, and we agreed to work exclusively with Takeda with respect to the designated targets.
 Under the Takeda Multi-Target Agreement, Takeda has an option during an option period to obtain an exclusive license under our intellectual property to develop, manufacture, commercialize and otherwise exploit ETBs against the designated targets. The option period for each target ends three months after the completion of the evaluation of such designated target. Under the Takeda Multi-Target Agreement, both parties have the right to terminate the agreement, with a specified notice period.
 We received an upfront fee of $1.0 million and an additional $2 million following the designation of each of the two targets in December 2017. As of December 31, 2018, we have received $5.0 million from Takeda pursuant to the Takeda Multi-Target Agreement.
 We may also receive an additional $25.0 million in aggregate through the exercise of the option to license ETBs. Additionally, we may also be entitled to receive clinical development milestone payments of up to approximately $397.0 million, for achievement of development milestones and regulatory approval of collaboration products under the Takeda Multi-Target Agreement. We may also be entitled to receive commercial milestone payments of up to $150.0 million, for achievement of pre-specified sales milestones related to net sales of all collaboration products under the Takeda Multi-Target Agreement. We are also entitled to tiered royalty payments of a mid-single to low-double digit percentage of net sales of any licensed ETBs, subject to certain reductions. Finally, we are entitled to receive up to $10.0 million in certain contingency fees.
 The Takeda Multi-Target Agreement will expire on the expiration of the option period (within three months after the completion of the evaluation of each designated target) for the designated targets if Takeda does not exercise its options, or, following exercise of the option, on the later of the expiration of patent rights claiming the licensed ETB or ten years from first commercial sale of a licensed ETB. The Takeda Multi-Target Agreement may be sooner terminated by Takeda for convenience or upon a change of control in our ownership, or by either party for an uncured material breach of the agreement.
 Other Research & Development Collaborations 
 Henry M. Jackson Foundation 
 In July 2014, Molecular entered into a non-exclusive license agreement with the Henry M. Jackson Foundation for certain biological materials for use in conjunction with the development of Molecular’s lead clinical stage ETB MT-3724. Under the terms of the agreement, Molecular is required to pay the Henry M. Jackson Foundation aggregate payments totaling $110,000 with respect to this license, upon completion of certain clinical milestones.
CPRIT Grant Contract
 On September 18, 2018, we entered into a Cancer Research Grant Contract (the “CPRIT Agreement”) with CPRIT, in connection with a grant of approximately $15.2 million awarded by CPRIT to us in November 2016 to fund research of a cancer therapy involving an ETB that is targeting CD38 (MT-4019) (the “Award”). Pursuant to the CPRIT Agreement, we may also use such funds to develop a replacement CD38 targeting ETB, with or without a partner. The Award is contingent upon funds being available during the term of the Agreement and subject to CPRIT’s ability to perform its obligations under the Agreement as well as our progress towards achievement of specified milestones, among other contractual requirements. In November 2011, Private Molecular was awarded a $10.6 million product development grant from CPRIT for its CD20-targeting ETB MT-3724. 
 
Subject to the terms of the Agreement, full ownership of any CPRIT funded technology and CPRIT funded intellectual property rights developed pursuant to the CPRIT Agreement will be retained by us, our Collaborators (as defined in the CPRIT Agreement) and, to the extent applicable, any participating third party (the “Project Results”). With respect to any Project Results, we agreed to grant to CPRIT a nonexclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free, perpetual, worldwide license, solely for academic, research and other non-commercial purposes, under the Project Results and to exploit any necessary additional intellectual property rights, subject to certain exclusions.
 14


We will pay to CPRIT, during the term of the CPRIT Agreement, certain payments equal to a percentage of revenue ranging from the low- to mid-single digits. These payments will continue up to and until CPRIT receives an aggregate amount of 400% of the sum of all monies paid to us by CPRIT under the CPRIT Agreement. If we are required to obtain a license from a third party to sell any such product, the revenue sharing percentages may be reduced. In addition, once we pay CPRIT 400% of the monies we have received under the CPRIT Agreement, we will continue to pay CPRIT a revenue-sharing percentage of 0.5%.
 The CPRIT Agreement will terminate, with certain obligations extending beyond termination, on the earlier of (a) May 31, 2019 or (b) the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) by mutual written consent of the parties, (ii) by CPRIT for an Event of Default (as defined in the CPRIT Agreement) by us, (iii) by CPRIT if allocated funds should become legally unavailable during the term of the CPRIT Agreement and CPRIT is unable to obtain additional funds or (iv) by us for convenience. CPRIT may approve a no cost extension for the CPRIT Agreement for a period not to exceed six months after the termination date if additional time is required to ensure adequate completion of the approved project, subject to the terms and conditions of the CPRIT Agreement.
Manufacturing 
 Molecular has built a GMP manufacturing facility located in Austin, TX to supply future clinical trial materials for internal and partnered ETB programs. Molecular relies in part on third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to manufacture and supply Molecular with GMP drug substance and drug product materials to support Molecular’s clinical trials. The manufacturing processes for MT-3724, TAK-169 and other preclinical ETB candidates have been developed by Molecular’s manufacturing staff. Once a process is developed and defined for an ETB, it is transferred to CMOs to scale-up and optimize for manufacturing that conforms to current GMP, or cGMP, standards. Molecular is building a GMP manufacturing facility located in Austin, TX to supply future clinical trial materials for internal and partnered ETB programs.
 Molecular has established well-defined, cost efficient manufacturing under GMP, including bioanalytical, quality control and quality assurance, logistics, distribution and supply chain management. After manufacturing, Molecular’s ETB candidates are tested and released by Molecular’s analytical and quality systems staff in conjunction with some select contract research organizations, or CROs. The quality control organization performs a series of release assays designed to ensure that the product meets all applicable specifications. Molecular’s quality assurance staff also reviews manufacturing and quality control records prior to batch release in an effort to assure conformance with cGMP as mandated by the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies. 
 Molecular’s manufacturing staff is trained and routinely evaluated for conformance to rigorous manufacturing procedures and quality standards. This oversight is intended to ensure compliance with FDA and foreign regulations and to provide consistent ETB output. Molecular’s quality control and quality assurance staff is similarly trained and evaluated as part of Molecular’s effort to ensure consistency in the testing and release of the product, as well as consistency in materials, equipment and facilities. 
 For the purposes of internal research and support for Molecular’s ongoing collaborations, Molecular has small scale manufacturing capabilities that are sufficient to manufacture drug materials for preclinical research.
 Evofosfamide  
 Overview
 Evofosfamide is a prodrug designed to be activated under hypoxic conditions commonly found in the tumor microenvironment. Within regions of tumor hypoxia, evofosfamide releases bromo isophosphoramide mustard (Br-IPM), a potent DNA alkylating agent that kills tumor cells by forming DNA crosslinks. Once activated in hypoxic tissues, Br-IPM can also diffuse into surrounding oxygenated regions of the tumor and kill cells there via a “bystander effect”. Because of its preferential activation in the targeted hypoxic regions of solid tumors, evofosfamide may be less likely to produce broad systemic toxicity seen with untargeted cytotoxic chemotherapies.
Clinical Overview
 The Company has a collaboration with the MD Anderson Cancer Center which presented preclinical data on evofosfamide in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitor antibodies. The data highlighted the promise of evofosfamide to improve the efficacy of this class of immuno-oncology therapeutics. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are potent anti-cancer therapies that unleash an immune system attack on cancer cells. Molecular Templates has initiated a clinical trial in various solid tumors evaluating evofosfamide in combination with one or more checkpoint inhibitor antibodies.

Intellectual Property Portfolio 
 Molecular seeks to protect proprietary rights to its platform technologies through a combination of patents and patent applications, trade secrets and know-how. Molecular’s platform technologies include ETBs directed to specific molecular targets, in which a Shiga toxin A subunit construct is linked to immunoglobulin domains directed to the molecular target, and their uses for treating cancer, killing cancer cells and selectively delivering payload molecules into target cells. Molecular’s platform technologies also include various ETB scaffolds regardless of target, and the Shiga toxin components of ETBs, including improved Shiga toxin A subunit constructs having disruptions of B-cell epitopes and/or T-cell epitopes for reduced immunogenicity when used in ETB scaffolds.
 To cover its proprietary technologies and its current pipeline of proprietary ETB products and related methods, such as methods of use, Molecular has filed patent applications representing 13 international patent families, together covering 102 pending regional and national applications worldwide, including 14 pending U.S. patent applications and 91 foreign patent applications currently pending in the regional European Patent Office and nine other jurisdictions outside of the U.S. and Europe (Australia, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Israel, India, Japan, Mexico, and South Korea).  Patents have granted from four of these international patent families, including in Australia, Europe, and Japan.
 Molecular’s patent families covering ETBs and modified ETB scaffolds for the targeted killing of cancer cells or for the selective delivery of molecules into a target cell include 13 internationally filed patent families. Patent rights in these patent families, if granted, will expire without extension in 2034–2038. Molecular also has a patent family directed to the screening of large ETB libraries, in which patent rights, if granted, will expire without extension in 2035. With respect to its ETB pipeline, Molecular’s lead compound which targets CD20, MT-3724, and pharmaceutical compositions and uses of MT-3724, are covered by three international patent families. Patent rights in these patent families, if granted, will expire without extension in 2034 and 2036. Molecular’s current pipeline also includes ETBs which target CD38, HER2, and PD-L1, covered by numerous patent applications, including one international patent family from which patent rights, if granted, will expire without extension in 2036.
 
As of December 31, 2018, Molecular owned 99 U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications relating to hypoxia-activated prodrugs and their manufacture, formulation and use, including covering the investigational prodrug evofosfamide currently in clinical development for treating cancer. These include 11 issued U.S. patents expiring from 2024 to 2031 and 59 issued foreign patents expiring from 2024 to 2036 (in each case, without extension), as well as four pending U.S., one pending Patent Cooperation Treaty and 19 pending foreign national patent applications, which, if issued, would in each case expire from 2024 to 2037 (without extension).
Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug and biological products, such as MT-3724, TAK-169, and any future product candidates. Generally, before a new drug or biologic can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority. 
 16


U.S. Drug Development 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations and biologics under the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and their implementing regulations. Both drugs and biologics also are subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-market may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on Molecular. MT-3724, TAK-169 and any ETB product candidates must be approved by the FDA through either a New Drug Application, or NDA, or Biologics Licensing Application, BLA, process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process generally involves the following: 

• | Completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with GLP requirements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before a trial may be initiated at that site;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice requirements, or GCP, and other clinical trial-related requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA that the NDA or BLA is sufficiently complete to permit a substantial review, in which case the NDA or BLA is filed;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Satisfactory completion of a FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug or biologic will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug or biologic’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential FDA audit of the preclinical and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA, including consideration of the views of an FDA advisory committee, if one was involved, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug or biologic in the United States.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The preclinical testing, clinical trials and the approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and Molecular cannot be certain that any approvals for MT-3724, TAK-169 and any future product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, or at all. The data required to support an NDA or BLA are generated in two distinct developmental stages: preclinical and clinical. The preclinical developmental stage generally involves laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals, which support subsequent clinical testing. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug to humans and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. 
 The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. 
 17


A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA or BLA. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the trial was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary. 
 Preclinical Studies and IND 
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of effects on reproduction and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions and places the IND on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 
 Clinical trials 
 Clinical trials generally are conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase I, Phase II and Phase III, which may overlap. 
  
• | Phase I clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the drug.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase II clinical trials involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase III clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase IV clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase IV clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA. 
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the drug, findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. 
 Phase I, Phase II and Phase III clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug or biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may perform additional animal studies and develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug or 
 18


biologic as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that MT-3724, TAK-169 and any future product candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life.
 NDA/BLA and FDA Review Process 
 Following completion of the clinical trials, data are analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA, along with proposed labeling, chemistry and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data. In short, the NDA or BLA is a request for approval to market the drug or biologic for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of safety and efficacy for a drug or safety, purity and potency for a biologic. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of FDA. FDA approval of an NDA or BLA must be obtained before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States. 
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each NDA or BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes annual prescription drug product program fees and an annual establishment fee on facilities used to manufacture prescription drugs and biologics. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business (fewer than 500 employees). Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs or BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. 
 The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs and BLAs before it accepts them for filing, or it may refuse to file the application and request additional information. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA or BLA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA or BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has 10 months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of a new molecular-entity (NME) or non NME NDA or original BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of a NME NDA or original BLA designated for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs or BLAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
 Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. After the FDA evaluates an NDA or BLA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data, including additional pivotal Phase III clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than Molecular interpret the same data. 
 19


Orphan Drug Designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety or providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues. Competitors, however, may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication but that could be used off-label in the orphan indication. 
 Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 The FDA has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biologics that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biologics are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life threatening condition and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor can request the FDA to designate the product for fast track status any time before receiving NDA or BLA approval, but ideally no later than the pre-NDA or pre-BLA meeting. 
 Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a fast track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. 
 The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biologic designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. A product may also be eligible for accelerated approval, if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies. In addition, it must demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. If the FDA concludes that a drug or biologic shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it will require such post-marketing restrictions, as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the product. 
 Additionally, a drug or biologic may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as fast track designation, plus intensive guidance from the FDA to ensure an efficient drug development program. Fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. 
 Pediatric Information 
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or BLA or supplement to a NDA or BLA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, amended the FDCA to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application 
 20


for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within 60 days of an end-of-Phase II meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase III or Phase II/III study. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials and/or other clinical development programs.
Post-marketing Requirements 
 Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting approved drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”). Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug or biologic, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA/BLA or NDA/BLA supplement, which may require additional data from preclinical studies or clinical trials. 
 The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for REMS to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA or BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA or BLA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing. FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMPs. Molecular rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of Molecular’s products in accordance with cGMPs. These manufacturers must comply with cGMPs that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs or biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMPs, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA or BLA, including recall. 
 Companion Diagnostics and Complementary Diagnostics 
 Molecular believes that the success of Molecular’s product candidates may depend, in part, on the development and commercialization of either a companion diagnostic or complementary diagnostic. Companion diagnostics and complementary diagnostics can identify patients who are most likely to benefit from a particular therapeutic product; identify patients likely to be at increased risk for serious side effects as a result of treatment with a particular therapeutic product; or monitor response to treatment with a particular therapeutic product for the purpose of adjusting treatment to achieve improved safety or effectiveness. Companion diagnostics and complementary diagnostics are regulated as medical devices by the FDA. The level of risk combined with available controls to mitigate risk determines whether a companion diagnostic device requires Premarket Approval Application, or PMA, approval or is cleared through the 510(k) premarket notification process. For a novel therapeutic product for which a companion diagnostic device is essential for the safe and effective use of the product, the companion diagnostic device should be developed and approved or 510(k)-cleared contemporaneously with the therapeutic. The use of the companion diagnostic device will be stipulated in the labeling of the therapeutic product. 
 21


Other Regulatory Matters 
 Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval may also be subject to regulation by other regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, Depending on the nature of the product, those authorities may include the CMS, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, OSHA, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments. 
 For example, in the United States, sales and marketing must comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws. These laws include the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes created by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. Moreover, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. 
 Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the ACA. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. 
 The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products. 
 The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. Any action against Molecular for violation of these laws, even if Molecular successfully defend against it, could cause Molecular to incur significant legal expenses and divert Molecular’s management’s attention from the operation of Molecular’s business. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by Molecular could materially affect Molecular’s business in an adverse way. 
 Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact Molecular’s business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to Molecular’s manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of Molecular’s products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of Molecular’s business.
 U.S. Patent-term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of MT-3724, TAK-169 and any future product candidates, some of Molecular’s U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent-term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent-term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA or BLA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. PTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, Molecular may apply for restoration of patent term for Molecular’s currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA or BLA.
 22


Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of a NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for a NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
An abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product was created by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, as part of the ACA. This amendment to the PHSA, in part, attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that the biological product be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a biological product be biosimilar to the reference product and that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products administered multiple times to an individual, that the product and the reference product may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product without such alternation or switch. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structure of biological products as compared to small molecule drugs, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being worked out by the FDA. 
 A reference biological product is granted 12 years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength, or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity, or potency. Whether a subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the “first licensure” of a biological product is determined on a case-by-case basis with data submitted by the sponsor.
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing regulatory exclusivity periods. This six-month exclusivity, which attaches to both the twelve-year and four-year exclusivity periods for reference biologics, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial. Furthermore, a biological product seeking licensure as biosimilar to or interchangeable with a reference product indicated for a rare disease or condition and granted seven years of orphan drug exclusivity may not be licensed by the FDA for the protected orphan indication until after the expiration of the seven-year orphan drug exclusivity period or the 12-year reference product exclusivity, whichever is later. 
 European Union Drug Development 
 In the European Union, Molecular’s future products also may be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, drugs, which are referred to as medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained. 
 23


Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated, a clinical trial application must be approved in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority, or NCA, and one or more Ethics Committees, or ECs. Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred. The EU clinical trials legislation currently is undergoing a transition process mainly aimed at harmonizing and streamlining clinical-trial authorization, simplifying adverse-event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials and increasing their transparency.
European Union Drug Review and Approval 
 In the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the European Union (including Norway and excluding Croatia), Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations. 

• | The Community MA is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. 
 European Union New Chemical Entity Exclusivity 
 In the European Union, new chemical entities, sometimes referred to as new active substances, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. The data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are determined to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with currently approved therapies. 
 24


European Union Orphan Designation and Exclusivity 
 In the European Union, the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union community (or where it is unlikely that the development of the medicine would generate sufficient return to justify the investment) and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment has been authorized (or, if a method exists, the product would be a significant benefit to those affected). 
 In the European Union, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and 10 years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
 Rest of the World Regulation 
 For other countries outside of the European Union and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 If Molecular fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, Molecular may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 
 Reimbursement 
 Sales of Molecular’s products will depend, in part, on the extent to which Molecular’s products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed care organizations. In the United States no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug or biological products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of Molecular’s products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require Molecular to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of Molecular’s products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. 
 The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, the ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of general controls and measures, coupled with the tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceutical drugs. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. Congress and President Trump have expressed their intention to repeal or repeal and replace the ACA. If that is done, many if not all of the provisions of the ACA may no longer apply to prescription drugs.
 25


The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which Molecular receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for Molecular’s products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices Molecular might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
 For a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. As of 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children’s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. In addition, as 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase. 
 As noted above, the marketability of any products for which Molecular receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. An increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States has increased and Molecular expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which Molecular receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of Molecular’s products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower. 
 Competition 
 Molecular competes directly with companies that focus on oncology as well as companies dedicating their resources to novel forms of cancer therapies. Molecular also faces competition from academic research institutions, governmental agencies and various other public and private research institutions. With the proliferation of new drugs and therapies into oncology, Molecular expects to face increasingly intense competition as new technologies become available. Any ETB candidates that Molecular successfully develops and commercializes will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 Many of Molecular’s competitors have significantly greater financial, manufacturing, marketing, drug development, technical and human resources than Molecular does. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of Molecular’s competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies also may prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with Molecular in recruiting and retaining top qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, Molecular’s programs.

The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of Molecular’s ETB candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, dosing convenience, price, the effectiveness of companion diagnostics in guiding the use of related therapeutics, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 
 Molecular’s commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if its competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, less expensive, more convenient or easier to administer, or have fewer or less severe effects than any products that Molecular may develop. Molecular’s competitors also may obtain FDA, EMA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than Molecular may obtain approval for its products, which could result in Molecular’s competitors establishing a strong market position before Molecular is able to enter the market. Even if Molecular’s ETB candidates achieve marketing approval, they may be priced at a significant premium over competitive products if any have been approved by then. 
 In addition to currently marketed therapies, there are also a number of products in late-stage clinical development directed to the same biological targets as Molecular’s programs, including antibodies, antibody drug conjugates and bi-specific antibodies.

Corporate Information 
 On August 1, 2017, we completed our business combination with Molecular Templates OpCo, Inc., or what was then known as “Molecular Templates, Inc.” (“Private Molecular”; formerly D5 Pharma Inc., a Delaware corporation incorporated on February 19, 2009), in accordance with the terms of an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”), dated as of March 16, 2017, by and among us (formerly known as Threshold Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: THLD) (“Threshold”), Trojan Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), our wholly owned subsidiary, and Private Molecular, pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into Private Molecular, with Private Molecular surviving as our wholly owned subsidiary, now “Molecular Templates OpCo,  Inc.” (the “Merger”).

On August 1, 2017, in connection with and prior to the consummation of the Merger, we effected an 11-for-1 reverse stock split of the shares of our common stock. Each outstanding share of Private Molecular common stock was converted into 7.7844 shares of common stock of the post-Merger combined company. As a result, we issued approximately 11.7 million shares of our common stock to the stockholders of Private Molecular in exchange for shares of common stock of Private Molecular. Upon the consummation of the Merger, we changed our name to “Molecular Templates, Inc.” For accounting purposes, Private Molecular is considered to have acquired Threshold in the Merger.
Immediately after the Merger, there were approximately 18,164,843 shares of our common stock outstanding. Immediately after the Merger, the former Private Molecular stockholders, warrant holders and option holders owned approximately 65.6% of our fully-diluted common stock, with the Threshold’s stockholders and warrant holders immediately prior to the Merger, whose warrants and shares of the common stock remain outstanding after the Merger, owning approximately 34.4% of our fully-diluted common stock.
 Molecular and Molecular Templates OpCo, Inc. each have a principal executive office at 9301 Amberglen Boulevard, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78729 and telephone number (512) 869-1555.
