ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
 
Bio-Techne and its subsidiaries, collectively doing business as Bio-Techne Corporation (Bio-Techne, we, our, us or the Company), develop, manufacture and sell life science reagents, instruments and services for the research and clinical diagnostic markets worldwide. With our deep product portfolio and application expertise, we sell integral components of scientific investigations into biological processes and molecular diagnostics, revealing the nature, diagnosis, etiology and progression of specific diseases. Our products aid in drug discovery efforts and provide the means for accurate clinical tests and diagnoses.
 
During our fiscal year 2019, we operated with two reporting segments – our Protein Sciences segment and our Diagnostics and Genomics segment. Our Protein Sciences segment is a leading developer and manufacturer of high-quality purified proteins and reagent solutions, most notably cytokines and growth factors, antibodies, immunoassays, biologically active small molecule compounds, tissue culture reagents and T-Cell activation technologies. This segment also includes protein analysis solutions that offer researchers efficient and streamlined options for automated western blot and multiplexed ELISA workflow. Our Genomics and Diagnostics segment develops and manufactures diagnostic products, including FDA-regulated controls, calibrators, blood gas and clinical chemistry controls and other reagents for OEM and clinical customers, as well as a portfolio of clinical molecular diagnostic oncology assays, including the ExoDx®Prostate(IntelliScore) test (EPI) for prostate cancer diagnosis. This segment also manufactures and sells advanced tissue-based in-situ hybridization assays (ISH) for research and clinical use.    
 
We are a Minnesota corporation with our global headquarters in Minneapolis, Minnesota. We were founded over forty years ago, in 1976, as Research and Diagnostic Systems, Inc. We became a publicly traded company in 1985 through a merger with Techne Corporation, now Bio-Techne Corporation. Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ under the symbol “TECH.” We operate globally, with offices in many locations throughout North America, Europe and Asia. Today, our product line extends to over 300,000 products, most of which we manufacture ourselves in multiple locations in North America, England and China.
 
Our historical focus was on providing high quality proteins, antibodies and immunoassays to the life science research market and hematology controls to the diagnostics market. Over the last six years, we implemented a disciplined strategy to accelerate growth in part by acquiring businesses and product portfolios that leveraged and diversified our existing product lines, filled portfolio gaps with differentiated high growth businesses, and expanded our geographic scope. From fiscal years 2013 through 2019 we have acquired fifteen companies that have expanded the product offerings and geographic footprint of both reporting segments. Recognizing the importance of an integrated, global approach to meeting our mission and accomplishing our strategies, we have maintained many of the brands of the companies we have acquired, but unified under a single global brand -- Bio-Techne.
 
We are committed to providing the life sciences community with innovative, high-quality scientific tools that allow our customers to make extraordinary discoveries. Our mission is to build “epic tools for epic science.” We intend to build on Bio-Techne’s past accomplishments, high product quality reputation and sound financial position by executing strategies that position us to serve as the standard for biological content in the research market, and to leverage that leadership position to enter the diagnostics and other adjacent markets. Our strategies include:
 
Continued innovation in core products. Through collaborations with key opinion leaders, participation in scientific discussions and societies, and leveraging our internal talent, we expect to be able to convert our continued significant investment in our research and development activities to be first-to-market with quality products that are at the leading edge of life science researchers’ needs, including expansion of our assay portfolios and products for cancer diagnostics and therapeutics.

Market and geographic expansion. We will continue to expand our sales staff and distribution channels globally in order to increase our global presence and make it easier for customers to transact with us. We will also leverage our existing portfolio to expand our product offerings into novel research fields and further into diagnostics and therapeutics markets, including in cell and gene therapy. 
 
Culture development and talent recruitment and retention. As we continue to grow both organically and through acquisition, we are intentionally fostering an “epic” culture based on the ideals of empowerment, passion, innovation and collaboration. We strive to recruit, train and retain the most talented staff, who will live out those epic ideals and implement our strategies effectively.
 
Targeted acquisitions and investments. We will continue to leverage our strong balance sheet to gain access to new and  differentiated technologies and products that improve our competitiveness in the current market, meet customers’ expanding work flow needs and allow us to enter adjacent markets, and to make investments in key technologies and product lines such as the manufacture of GMP grade reagents to support rapidly expanding immunotherapy markets. 
 
OUR PRODUCTS AND MARKETS
 
In fiscal 2019, net sales from Bio-Techne’s Protein Sciences and Diagnostics and Genomics segments represented 76% and 24% of consolidated net sales, respectively.

Protein Sciences Segment Competitors
 
With respect to the Reagent Solutions division of this segment, a number of large companies supply the worldwide market for protein-related and chemically-based research and diagnostic reagents, including BD Biosciences, Merck KGaA/EMD Chemicals, Inc., PeproTech, Inc., Abcam plc., and Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc, as well as a number of smaller, niche competitors.  Market success is primarily dependent upon product innovation and quality, selection of products, price and reputation. We believe we are one of the leading world-wide suppliers of cytokine and growth factors in the research market. We further believe that the expansion of our product offering, the recognized quality of our products, and the ability to continue to bring novel, cutting edge products and solutions to the market will allow us to remain competitive in the growing biotechnology research, diagnostic, and therapeutics markets. Our Analytical Solutions division has a number of similar competitors. Our Simple Western platform is a complete replacement for the traditional manual Western blotting technique. As a result, we face competition from the vendors that supply instruments and reagents to traditional Western blot users. These competitors include Bio-Rad Laboratories, Merck KGaA, PerkinElmer and Thermo Fisher Scientific. All of these vendors provide elements of the traditional work flow. Similarly, our SimplePlex platform replaces the traditional manual ELISA assay and introduces an automated multiplex immunoassay feature. Competitors include those who supply instruments and reagents for ELISAs, including Meso Scale Discovery, PerkinElmer, Thermo Fisher, Luminex, Millipore, Molecular Devices, Tecan BioTek, Quanterix and Bio-Rad Laboratories. The primary competitors for our Biologics instrumentation are Agilent Technologies, Danaher and PerkinElmer, as well as GE Healthcare, Shimadzu, Thermo Fisher and Waters. We believe our competitive position is strong due to the unique aspects of our products and our product quality.
Protein Sciences Segment Manufacturing
 
We are not dependent on key or sole source suppliers for most of our products in the Protein Sciences segment. We develop and manufacture the majority of our proteins using recombinant DNA technology, thus significantly reducing our reliance on outside resources. Our antibodies are produced using a variety of technologies including traditional animal immunization and hybridoma technology as well as recombinant antibody techniques. Our chemical-based small molecule products are synthesized from widely available products.
 
We manufacture our Analytical Solutions division instrumentation products for this segment at various locations in the United States and Canada. We manufacture our own components where we believe it adds significant value, but we rely on suppliers for the manufacture of some of the consumables, components, subassemblies and autosamplers used with, or included in, our systems, which are manufactured to our specifications. As with other products sold in this segment, we are not dependent on any one supplier and are not required to carry significant amounts of inventory to assure ourselves of a continuous allotment of goods from suppliers. We conduct all final testing and inspection of our products. We have established a quality control program, including a set of standard manufacturing and documentation procedures. All of our Protein Sciences Segment manufacturing sites are ISO 9001 or ISO 13485 certified or are in the process of being ISO certified.
 
The majority of our Reagent Solutions division products are shipped within one day of receipt of the customers' orders, while most of our Analytical Solutions products are shipped within one to two weeks of receipt of an order.
 
There was no significant backlog of orders for our Protein Sciences segment products as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or as of a comparable date for fiscal 2018.
 
Diagnostics and Genomics Segment 
 
The Diagnostics and Genomics segment also includes two divisions focused primarily in the diagnostics market – the Diagnostics division and the Genomics division.
 
Diagnostics and Genomics Segment Products
 
The Diagnostic division consists of regulated products traditionally used as calibrators and controls in the clinical setting. Also included are instrument and process control products for hematology, blood chemistry, blood gases, coagulation controls and reagents used in various diagnostic applications. Often we manufacture these reagents on a custom basis, tailored to a customer's specific diagnostic assay technology. We supply these reagents in various formats including liquid, frozen, or in lyophilized form. Most of these products are sold on an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) basis to instrument manufacturers with most products being FDA-cleared products.
 
The Genomics division includes products aimed at nucleic acid (RNA or DNA) analysis that can be used for diagnostic or research applications. Key product brands include Advanced Cell Diagnostics, or ACD, and Exosome Diagnostics. ACD products are aimed at RNA analysis of tissue while Exosome Diagnostics focuses on exosome-based liquid biopsy techniques that analyze genes or their transcripts. The first commercialized test from Exosome Diagnostics is a non-invasive urine-based assay for prostate cancer used as an aid in deciding the need for an initial biopsy.

Diagnostics and Genomics Segment Customers and Distribution Methods
 
Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) agreements represent the largest market for our Diagnostics division products. The majority of diagnostics sales are through OEM agreements, but we sell some of our diagnostics products directly to customers and, in Europe and Asia, also through distributors. The customers for the ACD research products include researchers in academia as well as investigators in pharmaceutical and biotech companies. We sell our products directly to those customers who are primarily located in North America, Europe and China, and through distributors elsewhere. In addition to being useful research tools, our RNA in situ hybridization assays have diagnostics applications as well, and several are currently under review by the FDA in partnership with diagnostics instrument manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies. We offer test services using our non-invasive urine-based assays for prostate cancer detection in the United States through a diagnostic laboratory regulated under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, or CLIA. Customers are patients prescribed such tests by their physicians.
 
No customers accounted for 10% or more of the reporting segment's consolidated net sales during fiscal years 2019, 2018, or 2017.
 
Diagnostics and Genomics Segment Competitors
 
In the Diagnostics division, the competitors for our hematology controls product line include Danaher Beckman Coulter and Streck. For our other control and calibrator products sold in this division, the principal competitors are Abbott Diagnostics, Beckman Coulter, Inc., Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc. and Sysmex Corporation. We compete based primarily on product performance, quality, and price in this division. SeraCare, HyTest Ltd and Thermo Fisher Scientific are additional competitors in the clinical diagnostic manufacturing and reagents markets.
 
Competitors in the Genomics division are varied, depending on the product line. While there are not any direct competitors for the RNA-based in situ hybridization products sold under the ACD brand, they are intended to be an alternative to immunohistochemistry assays and PCR-based diagnostic tests in certain circumstances. The non-invasive urine-based assay offered under our Exosome Diagnostics brand and used for prostate cancer biopsy decisions is supplemental to blood-based prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests, and is competitive with some other smaller companies that offer liquid biopsy-based alternatives such as 4kscore offered by Opko Health and SelectMDx offered by MDxHealth.
 
Diagnostics and Genomics Segment Manufacturing
 
The primary raw material for our hematology controls products is whole blood. We purchase human blood from commercial blood banks, and porcine and bovine blood from nearby meat processing plants. Although the cost of human blood has increased due to the requirement that it be tested for certain diseases and pathogens prior to use, the higher cost of these materials has not had a material adverse effect on our business thus far. Other controls are derived from various bodily fluids or cells from different animal species, which are then processed in-house to isolate the product of interest or from other bulk reagent suppliers that specialize in certain products. Our other reagent products are manufactured using a variety of suppliers, with no supplier representing a material portion of our business.
 
Most of the hematology controls products are shipped based on a preset, recurring schedule. However, the majority of our business in this segment are large orders shipped based on our customers' needs; we are highly dependent on our customers’ demand and inventory controls. Consequently, our revenues can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year.
 
Our Genomics division products and services are all synthesized from widely available products. We typically have several outside sources for all critical raw materials necessary for the manufacture of our products in this division. 
 
There was no significant backlog of orders for our Diagnostics and Genomics segment as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or as of a comparable date for fiscal 2018.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technologies and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets and trademarks, as well as customary contractual protections.
 
As of June 30, 2019, we had rights to 211 granted patents and approximately 175 pending patent applications.  In particular, products in the Analytical Solutions and Genomics divisions are protected primarily through pending patent applications and issued patents. In addition, certain of our products are covered by licenses from third parties to supplement our own patent portfolio.  Patent protection, if granted, generally has a life of 20 years from the date of the patent application or patent grant. We cannot provide assurance that any of our pending patent applications will result in the grant of a patent, whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims, and whether our claims will provide adequate coverage of our competitors' products or services.
 
In addition to pursuing patents on our products, we also preserve much of our innovation as trade secrets, particularly in the Reagent Solutions division of our Protein Sciences segment. We have taken steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology, in part by entering into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, corporate partners and, when needed, our advisors. See the description of risks associated with the Company's intellectual property in Item 1A of this Annual Report on form 10-K.
 
No assurance can be given that Bio-Techne's products do not infringe upon patents or proprietary rights owned or claimed by others. Bio-Techne has not conducted a patent infringement study for each of its products. Where we have been contacted by patent holders with certain intellectual property rights, Bio-Techne typically has entered into licensing agreements with patent holders under which it has the exclusive and/or non-exclusive right to use patented technology as well as the right to manufacture and sell certain patented products to the research and/or diagnostics markets.
 
Bio-Techne has obtained trademark registration in certain countries for certain of its brand and product names. Bio-Techne believes it has common law trademark rights to certain marks in addition to those which it has registered.
 
 6


SEASONALITY OF BUSINESS
 
Bio-Techne believes there is some seasonality as a result of vacation and academic schedules of its worldwide customer base, particularly for the Protein Sciences segment. A majority of Diagnostics division products are manufactured in large bulk lots and sold on a schedule set by the customer. Consequently, sales for that segment can be unpredictable, and not necessarily based on seasonality. As a result, we can experience material and sometimes unpredictable fluctuations in our revenue from this segment.
LAWS AND REGULATIONS
 
Our operations, and some of the products we offer, are subject to a number of complex and stringent laws and regulations governing the production, marketing, handling, transportation and distribution of chemicals, drugs and other similar products, including the operating and security standards of the Food and Drug Administration, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and various comparable state and foreign agencies. As Bio-Techne’s businesses also include export and import activities, we are subject to pertinent laws enforced by the U.S. Departments of Commerce, State and Treasury. Privacy laws in various jurisdictions impact our business in a number of ways, including requiring us to take care when processing employee and customer data. One of our products under our Exosome Diagnostics brand is offered as a test under a CLIA-certified laboratory; consequently, we must comply with governmental regulations relating to billing practices and financial relationships with physicians, hospitals, and health systems. While we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations, any noncompliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict our ability to provide competitive distribution services and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition. To date, none has had a material impact on our operations.
 
We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by a reduction in revenue associated with these customers. We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
Through its subsidiaries, Bio-Techne employed approximately 2,250 full-time and part-time employees as of June 30, 2019.
 
INVESTOR INFORMATION
 
We are subject to the information requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act). Therefore, we file periodic reports, proxy statements, and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC maintains an internet site (http://www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically.
 
Financial and other information about us is available on our web site (http://www.bio-techne.com/investors). We make available on our web site copies of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such material electronically or otherwise furnishing it to the SEC.
