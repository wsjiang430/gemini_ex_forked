On May 6, 2010, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Ultimate Novelty Sports Inc., an Ontario, Canada Corporation (“UNSI Canada”). On October 30, 2013, pursuant to a sale of subsidiary agreement (the “Sale of Subsidiary Agreement”) the Company sold all of the capital stock of UNSI Canada to Optimal, Inc., a Nevada corporation.
 
On January 29, 2014, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with Pure Health, Inc. (“Pure”), a Puerto Rican corporation (the “Pure Consulting Agreement”). The purpose of the Pure Consulting Agreement was to retain Pure to consult the Company with regard to the development of health and wellness products as well as nutritional supplements, including idea generation, preforming and designing formulations for products to be used in the health and nutrition market.
 
On March 6, 2014, the Company changed its name from Ultimate Novelty Sports, Inc. to Earth Science Tech, Inc. (the “Name Change”).
 
On May 28, 2014 the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) approved the Name Change and a change of trading symbol from UNOV to ETST.
 
On June 6, 2014, the Company filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada Articles of Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation and a Certificate of Designation creating a Preferred A class of stock with 10,000,000 preferred A shares (the “Preferred A Shares”) having a par value of $0.001 per share.
 
On March 6, 2015, the Company entered into a License and Distribution Agreement (the “I Vape License and Distribution Agreement”) with I Vape Vapor, Inc. a Minnesota corporation (“I Vape”). Pursuant to the I Vape License and Distribution Agreement the Company licensed to I Vape the rights to use the Company’s Ultra-High Grade CBD Rich Hemp Oil in I Vape’s E-Cigarettes within the U.S. As part of the I Vape License and Distribution Agreement, the Company formed Earth Science Tech Vapor One, Inc., a wholly owned Florida corporation subsidiary.
 
Today, ETST is a biotechnology company focused on unique nutraceuticals and bioceuticals designed to excel in industries such as health, wellness, nutrition, supplements, cosmetics and alternative medicine to improve the quality of life for consumers worldwide. ETST seeks to deliver non-prescription nutritional and dietary supplements that help with treating symptoms such as: chronic pain, joint pain, inflammation, seizures, high blood pressure, memory loss, depression, weight management, nausea, aging and overall wellness. This may include products such as CBD as a natural constituent of hemp oil, vitamins, minerals, herbs, botanicals, personal care products, homeopathies, functional foods and other products. These products will be in various formulations and delivery forms including capsules, tablets, soft gels, chewables, liquids, creams, sprays, powders, and whole herbs.
 
In particular, ETST is focused on researching and developing innovative hemp extracts and making them accessible worldwide. ETST plans to be a supplier of high quality hemp oil enriched with high-grade CBD. ETST’s primary goal is to advance different high quality hemp extracts with a broad profile of cannabinoids and additional natural molecules found in industrial hemp and to identify their distinct properties.
 
On January 11, 2019, the Company entered into an agreement with Aaron Decker, and Derrick West, individuals, pursuant to which the Company will transfer, set over and assign to Mr. Decker and Mr. West 95% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Kannabidioid, Inc. This transfer of KBD and its business places Mr. Decker and Mr. West or their corporate nominee in full control of KBD for all purposes, subject to their undertaking aggressively and assiduously to pursue the growth of Kannabidioid, Inc.’s business and to maximize its customer base, product line, and profitability. ETST entered into this agreement because management determined that the opportunities for the growth of its other product lines will require that it deploy its resources on these other product lines such that it’s better to allow another management team to build the KBD business. In allowing another management team to build the KBD business, it is expected that ETST will not only continue to benefit from the sales, but it may also be in a position to benefit from its growth without the necessity of deploying additional resources to realize that growth.
 
On January 11, 2019, the Company received notice that Strongbow Advisors, Inc. (“Strongbow”), and Robert Stevens (“Stevens”, and together with Strongbow, the “Receiver”) had been appointed by the Nevada District Court, as Receiver for the Registrant in Case No. A-18-784952-C.

The Company sought the appointment of the Receiver after it found itself in an imminent danger of insolvency following the issuance by an arbitration panel of an award (the “Award”) in the sum of $3,994,522.5 million in favor of Cromogen Biotechnology Corporation (“Cromogen”) in the matter entitled Cromogen Biotechnology Corporation vs. Earth Science Tech, Inc. (the “Cromogen Litigation”).
 
The Award consisted of a sum for breach of contract against the Company in the amount of $120,265.00, a sum for costs and fees against the Company in the amount of $111,057.00 and a sum for the claim of tortuous interference and conversion against the Company in the amount of $3,763,200.00. The District Court in Florida had confirmed the Award granted by the arbitration panel, denying however, the award of fees that the arbitration panel had granted Cromogen.
 
The Cromogen Litigation is now on appeal and the Company is optimistic about its prospects on appeal. Nevertheless, the outcome remains speculative and so notwithstanding its prospects for success on appeal, and faced with such a large judgment and the imminent danger of insolvency, the Company determined that it was in the best interest of its shareholders and creditors to seek protection under receivership and the appointment of a receiver. As of the date of this prospectus, the Company remains in imminent danger of insolvency as the outcome of the Cromogen Litigation remains speculative.
 
As part of the impact of the receivership, the Court issued a Writ of Injunction or “Blanket Stay” covering the Company and its assets during the time that the Company is in receivership. As a result of the “Blanket Stay” the Company’s estate is protected from creditors and interference with its administration is prevented while the Company’s financial issues are being fully analyzed and resolved. As part of this process, creditors will be notified and required to provide claims in writing under oath on or before the deadline stated in the notice provided by the Receiver or those claims will be barred under NRS §78.675. The Blanket Stay will remain in place unless otherwise waived by the Receiver, or it is vacated by the Court or alternatively, lifted by the Court, upon a “motion to lift stay” duly made and approved by the Nevada District Court.
 
The appointment of the Receiver was approved unanimously by the Board and by a majority of the Company’s shareholders. Strongbow and Stevens were selected because of their reputation in helping (i) companies restructure and (ii) to execute on their business plans, albeit under a debt and capital structure that allows them to succeed. Stevens and Strongbow assist companies by helping them raise the capital needed not only to pay debts, but build and grow their businesses. The Receiver, however, is an agent of the court, and will be independent and neutral in managing the Company’s operations and trying to preserve the Company’s value for the creditors and shareholders.
 
There are a number of possible outcomes to the receivership, including settlement and payment to creditors, reorganization, or liquidation. The intent of the Receiver is to reorganize the Company, pay or settle the Company’s debts and emerge from receivership. If the Receiver is not successful in mitigating the Company’s liabilities, the Company’s results could be materially adversely impacted and the Company may be forced to liquidate its business. 
 
On February 28, 2019, the Company entered into an Equity Financing Agreement (the “GHS Equity Financing Agreement”) and Registration Rights Agreement (the “GHS Registration Rights Agreement”) with GHS Investments LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (“GHS”). Under the terms of the Equity Financing Agreement, GHS agreed to provide the Company with up to $5,000,000 upon effectiveness of a registration statement on Form S-1 (the “Registration Statement”) filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”).
 
Following effectiveness of the Registration Statement, the Company shall have the discretion to deliver puts to GHS and GHS will be obligated to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share based on the investment amount specified in each put notice. Additionally, in accordance with the Equity Financing Agreement, the Company shall issue GHS a promissory note in the principal amount of $30,000 to offset transaction costs (the “Note”).

Current Operations
 
CORPORATE STRATEGY
 
In particular, ETST is focused on researching and developing innovative hemp extracts and making them accessible worldwide. ETST plans to be a supplier of high quality hemp oil enriched with high-grade CBD. ETST’s primary goal is to advance different high quality hemp extracts with a broad profile of cannabinoids and additional natural molecules found in industrial hemp and to identify their distinct properties.
 
Our missions are to educate the public on the many and varied nutritional and health benefits of CBD-rich hemp oil, to optimize purity in formulation, and to find new product delivery systems. Our corporate strategy in developing our operations is as follows.
 
To design and produce CBD enhanced nutraceutical products for sale to the general public. We intend to create high-grade CBD-rich hemp oil and other CBD containing products unique to the current market in the nutraceuticals industry. We believe that our formulations will set us apart from competing products for promoting health. We have formulated and produced our initial CBD products, intended for, subject to performance, treating various symptoms of diseases and ailments or for overall health. The Company plans to expand manufacturing and marketing of these CBD products with expansion of products over the next five years.
 
To offer a wide selection of health and nutrition products through online, clinics, pharmacies, and in-store retail. Through our wholly owned subsidiary, we plan to continue expanding retail sales of nutritional supplements through online, clinics, pharmacies, and in-store sales. Our product selection includes many high-quality supplement brands, and includes our proprietary CBD-rich hemp oil.
 
CONSUMER PRODUCTS
 
We seek to take advantage of an emerging worldwide trend to re-energize the production of hemp and to foster its many uses for consumers. Historically cultivated for industrial and practical purposes, hemp is used today for textiles, paper, auto parts, biofuel, cosmetics, animal feed, nutritional supplements, and much more. The market for hemp-based products is expected to increase substantially over the next five years.

Hemp-based CBD is one of at least 80 cannabinoids found in hemp, and is non-psychoactive. Our U.S. based operations oversee our raw material supply chain, raw material processing, product development and manufacturing, and sales and marketing. We will continue to scale-up our processing capability to accommodate new products in our pipeline.
 
We expect to realize revenue to fund our working capital needs through the sale of finished products and raw materials to third parties. However, in order to fund our drug development efforts, we will need to raise additional capital either through the issuance of equity and/or the issuance of debt. In the event we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital to fund our drug development efforts, we may need to curtail or delay such activity.
 
Consumer product extraction and quality
 
We believe our high-grade CBD-rich hemp oil contains the high quality natural CBD because it’s formulated using a wide array of cutting-edge technologies, including super critical extraction process (CO 2), isolation, and micron filtration. Super critical extraction is a gentle approach and the key method in the extraction of our CBD. The method exploits the fact that CO 2 at low temperature and under high pressure becomes liquid and thereby draws the cannabinoids and terpenes from the plant material. Using state-of-the-art equipment, carbon dioxide (CO 2) is compressed to upwards of 10,000 psi. At these extremes CO 2 becomes ‘super critical’ where it retains the properties of both a liquid and a gas at the same time. The cold temperature does not damage any heat-sensitive nutrients like vitamins or enzymes. When the super critical fluid is added to the nutrient-rich hemp it releases the phytonutrients. The CO 2 is then free and recycled, leaving a concentrated and pure extract that we believe is more easily digested. These low temperatures thru the extraction process preserve a broad spectrum of valuable and beneficial molecules that are often lost using other extraction methods. This gentle method permits the production of a purer form of CBD-rich hemp oil while conserving other valuable and beneficial molecules that are originally contained in the hemp plant. We believe that there are over 400 phytonutrients that exist in hemp plants.
 
Our CBD-rich hemp oil does not contain any synthetic cannabinoids and is not an isolate. It contains everything that is naturally occurring in the original industrial hemp plant. With our high quality CBD-rich hemp oil you benefit from the natural interaction of phytonutrients in their balanced wide-ranging form that may offer the most benefit for overall wellness. Our commercialized CBD based product line, High Grade Full Spectrum Cannabinoids, offers 7 distinct cannabinoids maximizing all the therapeutic benefits the industrial hemp plant has to offer.
 
Other competitors and companies may use certain methods for extracting hemp including toxic solvents and/or high heat which we believe are unsustainable, dangerous and don’t extract the full balance of nutrients from the industrial hemp plant. One of the most popular processes used to extract hemp oils is alcohol extraction, due to its simplicity and low costs. This may lead to a product that still contains trace amounts of alcohol, as it can be difficult to separate out after extraction. The alcohol extraction used by other companies and our competitors requires the hemp and alcohol mixture to be boiled for long periods of time, potentially damaging sensitive nutrients and important components of the oil. Most companies that claim to be full spectrum only contain 2-5 cannabinoids compared to the 7 we offer in our commercialized batches.
 
Our CBD-rich hemp oil is sourced from the high quality industrial hemp plants grown by generational family farmers. In order to produce consistent and nutritious CBD-rich oils, these hemp plants are grown domestically currently in Oregon and Kentucky.
 
We lab test our hemp oil multiple times during the manufacturing process, from seed to shelf. This includes being tested for cannabinoid panel content, terpenoids, pesticides, residual solvents, mycotoxins, and micros.
 
SUBSIDIARIES
 
The Company’s’ subsidiaries include Earth Science Tech Inc., Nutrition Empire LLC., Cannabis Therapeutics, Inc., Earth Science Pharmaceutical Inc., and Earth Science Foundation, Inc. (all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated on consolidation.)

PRODUCT REGULATION
 
We are subject to local and federal laws in our operating jurisdictions. We hold required licenses for product production and distribution and monitor changes in laws, regulations, treaties and agreements.
 
The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 known as the “2018 Farm Bill” is United States federal legislation signed into law on December 20, 2018 which provides much of the legal framework for the hemp-based CBD product category. The 2018 Farm Bill permanently removed “hemp” from the purview of the Controlled Substances Act, and accordingly, the Drug Enforcement Administration (the “DEA”) no longer has any claim to interfere with the interstate commerce of hemp products. Some of the immediate impact from this legislation includes the ability for farmers to access crop insurance and U.S. Department of Agriculture programs for certification and competitive grants. While the DEA is now officially not involved in hemp regulation, the FDA retains its authority to regulate ingestible and topical products, including those that contain hemp and hemp extracts such as CBD.
 
A range of federal regulations govern our product development, manufacturing, distribution, sales and marketing, including the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (the “DSHEA”). Under DSHEA, supplements are effectively regulated by the FDA for Good Manufacturing Practices under 21 CFR Part 111. DSHEA defines a “dietary supplement” as a product intended to supplement the diet that contains one or more of the following: (a) a vitamin; (b) a mineral; (c) an herb or other botanical; (d) an amino acid; (e) a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; or (f) a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any ingredient described in clause (a) through (e). Thus, the law permits a wide range of dietary ingredients in dietary supplements, including CBD which is an extract of a botanical (Cannabis sativa L. plant). CBD also falls under clause (e) as it is a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake.
 
MARKETS
 
The user market for CBD products and other nutraceuticals is generally an individual who has a specific health issue where a health advisor or distributor has provided or directed that user to our product. The market for nutraceuticals is subject to many influential factors, but the main issues affecting the market are consumer spending and government regulation.
COMPETITION
 
The nutraceutical industry is subject to significant competition and pricing pressures. We may experience significant competitive pricing pressures as well as competitive products. Several significant competitors may offer products with prices that may match or are lower than ours. We believe that the products we offer are generally competitive with those offered by other supplement and nutraceutical companies; however, we believe that our products are unique and will set themselves apart from competing products. It is possible that one or more of our competitors could develop a significant research advantage over us that allows them to provide superior products or pricing, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Continued pricing pressure or improvements in research and shifts in customer preferences away from natural supplements could adversely impact our customer base or pricing structure and have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
