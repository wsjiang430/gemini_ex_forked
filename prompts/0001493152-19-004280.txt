ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview
 
FAT Brands Inc., formed in March 2017 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fog Cutter Capital Group, Inc. (“FCCG”), is a leading multi-brand restaurant franchising company that develops, markets, and acquires predominantly fast casual restaurant concepts around the world. As a franchisor, we generally do not own or operate restaurant locations, but rather generate revenue by charging franchisees an initial franchise fee as well as ongoing royalties. This asset light franchisor model provides the opportunity for strong profit margins and an attractive free cash flow profile while minimizing restaurant operating company risk, such as long-term real estate commitments or capital investments. Our scalable management platform enables us to add new stores and restaurant concepts to our portfolio with minimal incremental corporate overhead cost, while taking advantage of significant corporate overhead synergies. The acquisition of additional brands and restaurant concepts as well as expansion of our existing brands are key elements of our growth strategy.
 
As of December 30, 2018, we were the owner and franchisor of the following restaurant brands:
 
Fatburger. Founded in Los Angeles, California in 1947, Fatburger (The Last Great Hamburger StandTM) has, throughout its history, maintained its reputation as an iconic, all-American, Hollywood favorite hamburger restaurant serving a variety of freshly made-to-order, customizable, big, juicy, and tasty Fatburgers, Turkeyburgers, Chicken Sandwiches, Impossible™ Burgers, Veggieburgers, French fries, onion rings, soft-drinks and milkshakes. With a legacy spanning over 70 years, Fatburger’s dedication to superior quality inspires robust loyalty amongst its customer base and has long appealed to American cultural and social leaders. We have counted many celebrities and athletes as past franchisees and customers, and we believe this prestige has been a principal driver of the brand’s strong growth. Fatburger offers a premier dining experience, demonstrating the same dedication to serving gourmet, homemade, custom-built burgers as it has since 1947. As of December 30, 2018, there were 158 franchised and sub-franchised Fatburger locations across 5 states and 18 countries.
 
Buffalo’s Cafe. Established in Roswell, Georgia in 1985, Buffalo’s Cafe (Where Everyone is FamilyTM) is a family-themed casual dining concept known for its chicken wings and 13 distinctive homemade wing sauces, burgers, wraps, steaks, salads and other classic American cuisine. Featuring a full bar and table service, Buffalo’s Cafe offers a distinctive dining experience affording friends and family the flexibility to share an intimate dinner together or to casually watch sporting events while enjoying extensive menu offerings. Beginning in 2011, Buffalo’s Express was developed and launched as a fast-casual, smaller footprint variant of Buffalo’s Cafe offering a limited version of the full menu with an emphasis on chicken wings, wraps and salads. Current Buffalo’s Express outlets are co-branded with Fatburger locations, providing our franchisees with complementary concepts that share kitchen space and result in a higher average unit volume (compared to stand-alone Fatburger locations). As of December 30, 2018, there were 18 franchised Buffalo’s Cafe and 89 co-branded Fatburger / Buffalo’s Express locations globally.
 
Ponderosa & Bonanza Steakhouse. Ponderosa Steakhouse, founded in 1965, and Bonanza Steakhouse, founded in 1963 (collectively, “Ponderosa”), offer the quintessential American steakhouse experience, for which there is strong and growing demand in international markets, particularly in Asia and the Middle East. Ponderosa and Bonanza Steakhouses offer guests a high-quality buffet and broad array of great tasting, affordably-priced steak, chicken and seafood entrées. Buffets at Ponderosa and Bonanza Steakhouses feature a large variety of all you can eat salads, soups, appetizers, vegetables, breads, hot main courses and desserts. An additional variation of the brand, Bonanza Steak & BBQ, offers a full-service steakhouse with fresh farm-to-table salad bar and a menu showcase of USDA flame-grilled steaks and house-smoked BBQ, with contemporized interpretations of traditional American classics. As of December 30, 2018, there were 85 Ponderosa and 14 Bonanza restaurants operating under franchise and sub-franchise agreements in 17 states in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Qatar and Taiwan.

Hurricane Grill & Wings. Founded in Fort Pierce, Florida in 1995, Hurricane Grill & Wings is a tropical beach themed casual dining restaurant known for its fresh, jumbo, chicken wings, 35 signature sauces, burgers, bowls, tacos, salads and sides. Featuring a full bar and table service, Hurricane Grill & Wings laid-back, casual, atmosphere affords family and friends the flexibility to enjoy dining experiences together regardless of the occasion. The acquisition of Hurricane Grill & Wings has been complementary to FAT Brands existing portfolio chicken wing brands, Buffalo’s Cafe and Buffalo’s Express. As of December 30, 2018, there were 56 franchised Hurricane Grill & Wings and 3 franchised Hurricane BTWs (Hurricane’s fast-casual burgers, tacos & wings concept), across 9 states.
 
Yalla Mediterranean. Founded in 2014, Yalla Mediterranean is a Los Angeles-based restaurant chain specializing in authentic, healthful, Mediterranean cuisine with an environmentally conscience and focus on sustainability. The word “yalla” which means “let’s go” is embraced in every aspect of Yalla Mediterranean’s culture and is a key component of our concept. Yalla Mediterranean offers a healthful Mediterranean menu of wraps, plates, and bowls in a fast-casual setting, with cuisine prepared fresh daily using, GMO-free, local ingredients for a menu that includes vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free and dairy-free options accommodating customers with a wide variety of dietary needs and preferences. The brand demonstrates its commitment to the environment by using responsibly-sourced proteins and utensils, bowls and serving trays made from compostable materials. Each of Yalla’s seven locations across California also feature on-tap selections of craft beers and fine wines. We intend to sell the existing Yalla locations to franchisees and expand the business through additional franchising.
 
Beyond our current brand portfolio, and the Hurricane Grill and Wings and Yalla Mediterranean acquisitions, we intend to acquire other restaurant franchise concepts that will allow us to offer additional food categories and expand our geographic footprint. In evaluating potential acquisitions, we specifically seek concepts with the following characteristics:
 

● | established, widely-recognized brands; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | steady cash flows; 
● | track records of long-term, sustainable operating performance; 
● | good relationships with franchisees; 
● | sustainable operating performance; 
● | geographic diversification; and 
● | growth potential, both geographically and through co-branding initiatives across our portfolio. 

 
Leveraging our scalable management platform, we expect to achieve cost synergies post-acquisition by reducing the corporate overhead of the acquired company – most notably in the legal, accounting and finance functions. We also plan to grow the top line revenues of newly acquired brands through support from our management and systems platform, including public relations, marketing and advertising, supply chain assistance, site selection analysis, staff training and operational oversight and support.
 
Our franchisee base consisted of 158 franchisees as of December 30, 2018. Of these franchisees, 136 operate in North America and 44 own multiple restaurant locations. System wide, our franchisees operated 334 restaurants as of December 30, 2018 (233 of which were located in North America), with store level sales in excess of $368 million in 2018. As of December 30, 2018, we had a total of 200 new unit development commitments which remain to be completed.


The FAT Brands Difference – Fresh. Authentic. Tasty.
 
Our name represents the values that we embrace as a company and the food that we provide to customers – Fresh. Authentic. Tasty (which we refer to as “FAT”). The success of our franchisor model is tied to consistent delivery by our restaurant operators of freshly prepared, made-to-order food that our customers desire. With the input of our customers and franchisees, we continually strive to keep a fresh perspective on our brands by enhancing our existing menu offerings and introducing appealing new menu items. When enhancing our offerings, we ensure that any changes are consistent with the core identity and attributes of our brands, although we do not intend to adapt our brands to be all things to all people. In conjunction with our restaurant operators (which means the individuals who manage and/or own our franchised restaurants), we are committed to delivering authentic, consistent brand experiences that have strong brand identity with customers. Ultimately, we understand that we are only as good as the last meal served, and we are dedicated to having our franchisees consistently deliver tasty, high-quality food and positive guest experiences in their restaurants.

In pursuing acquisitions and entering new restaurant brands, we are committed to instilling our FAT Brands values into new restaurant concepts. As our restaurant portfolio continues to grow, we believe that both our franchisees and diners will recognize and value this ongoing commitment as they enjoy a wider concept offering.
 
Competitive Strengths
 
We believe that our competitive strengths include:
 

● | Management Platform Built for Growth. We have developed a robust and comprehensive management and systems platform that supports the expansion of our existing brands while enabling the accretive and efficient acquisition and integration of additional restaurant concepts. We dedicate our considerable resources and industry knowledge to promote the success of our franchisees, offering them multiple support services such as public relations, marketing and advertising, supply chain assistance, site selection analysis, staff training and operational oversight and support. Furthermore, our platform is scalable and adaptable, allowing us to incorporate new concepts into the FAT Brands family with minimal incremental corporate costs. We intend to grow our existing brands as well as make strategic and opportunistic acquisitions that complement our existing portfolio of concepts providing an entrance into targeted restaurant segments. We believe that our platform is a key differentiator in pursuing this strategy. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Asset Light Business Model Driving High Free Cash Flow Conversion. We maintain an asset light business model requiring minimal capital expenditures by franchising our restaurant concepts to our owner / operators. The multi-brand franchisor model also enables us to efficiently scale the number of restaurant locations with very limited incremental corporate overhead and minimal exposure to store-level risk, such as long-term real estate commitments and increases in employee wage costs. Our multi-brand approach also gives us the organizational depth to provide a host of services to our franchisees, which we believe enhances their financial and operational performance. As a result, new store growth and accelerating financial performance of the FAT Brands network drive increases in our franchise fee and royalty revenue streams while expanding profit and free cash flow margins. 
● | Strong Brands Aligned with FAT Brands Vision. We have an enviable track record of delivering Fresh, Authentic, and Tasty meals across our franchise system. Our Fatburger and Buffalo’s concepts have built distinctive brand identities within their respective segments, providing made-to-order, high-quality food at competitive prices. The Ponderosa and Bonanza brands deliver an authentic American steakhouse experience with which customers identify. Hurricane Grill & Wings offer customers fresh, jumbo chicken wings with an assortment of sauces and rubs in a casual dining atmosphere, while our newest acquisition, Yalla Mediterranean offers a healthful Mediterranean menu of wraps, plates, and bowls in a fast-casual setting. By maintaining alignment with the FAT Brands vision across an expanding platform, we believe that our concepts will appeal to a broad base of domestic and global consumers. 
● | Experienced and Diverse Global Franchisee Network. We have new restaurant commitments of over 200 locations across our brands. We anticipate that our current franchisees will open more than 30 new restaurants annually for at least the next five years. The acquisition of additional restaurant franchisors will also increase the number of restaurants operated by our existing franchisee network. Additionally, our franchise development team has built an attractive pipeline of new potential franchisees, with many experienced restaurant operators and new entrepreneurs eager to join the FAT Brands family. 


● | Ability to Cross-Sell Existing Franchisees Concepts from the FAT Brands Portfolio. Our ability to easily, and efficiently, cross-sell our existing franchisees new brands from our FAT Brands portfolio affords us the ability to grow more quickly and satisfy our existing franchisees’ demands to expand their organizations. By having the ability to offer our franchisees a variety of concepts (i.e., a fast-casual better-burger concept, a fast-casual chicken wing concept, a casual dining concept and steakhouse concepts) from the FAT Brands portfolio, our existing franchisees are able to acquire the rights to, and develop, their respective markets with a well-rounded portfolio of FAT Brands concept offerings affording them the ability to strategically satisfy their respective market demands by developing our various concepts where opportunities are available. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Seasoned and Passionate Management Team. Our management team and employees are critical to our success. Our senior leadership team has more than 200 years of combined experience in the restaurant industry, and many have been a part of our team since the acquisition of the Fatburger brand in 2003. We believe that our management team has the track record and vision to leverage the FAT Brands platform to achieve significant future growth. In addition, through their holdings in FCCG, our senior executives own a significant equity interest in the company, ensuring long-term commitment and alignment with our public shareholders. Our management team is complemented by an accomplished Board of Directors.

Growth Strategy
 
The principal elements of our growth strategy include:
 

● | Opportunistically Acquire New Brands. Our management platform was developed to cost-effectively and seamlessly scale with new restaurant concept acquisitions. The recent acquisition of the Hurricane Grill & Wings and Yalla Mediterranean brands are a continuation of this growth strategy. We have identified food categories that appeal to a broad international base of customers, targeting the burgers, chicken, pizza, steak, coffee, sandwich and dessert segments for future growth. We have developed a strong and actionable pipeline of potential acquisition opportunities to achieve our objectives. We seek concepts with established, widely-recognized brands; steady cash flows; track records of long-term, good relationships with franchisees; sustainable operating performance; geographic diversification; and growth potential, both geographically and through co-branding initiatives across our portfolio. We approach acquisitions from a value perspective, targeting modest multiples of franchise-level cash flow valuations to ensure that acquisitions are immediately accretive to our earnings prior to anticipated synergies. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Optimize Capital Structure to Enable Profitable Growth through Acquisitions. While we believe our existing business can be funded through cash generated from current operations, we intend to finance future acquisitions of restaurant brands through the issuance of debt and equity financing placed with investors and issued directly to sellers of restaurant brands. We are actively pursuing various financing alternatives, with the goal of reducing and optimizing our all-in cost of capital and providing us with the means to pursue larger and more profitable acquisitions. 
● | Accelerate Same-Store Sales Growth. Same-store sales growth reflects the change in year-over-year sales for the comparable store base, which we define as the number of stores open for at least one full fiscal year. To optimize restaurant performance, we have embraced a multi-faceted same-store sales growth strategy. We utilize customer feedback and closely analyze sales data to introduce, test and perfect existing and new menu items. In addition, we regularly utilize public relations and experiential marketing, which we leverage via social media and targeted digital advertising to expand the reach of our brands and to drive traffic to our stores. Furthermore, we have embraced emerging technology to develop our own brand-specific mobile applications, allowing guests to find restaurants, order online, earn rewards and join our e-marketing providers. We have also partnered with third-party delivery service providers, including UberEATS, Grub Hub, Amazon Restaurants and Postmates, which provide online and app-based delivery services and constitute a new sales channel for our existing locations. Finally, many of our franchisees are pursuing a robust capital expenditure program to remodel legacy restaurants and to opportunistically co-brand them with our Buffalo’s Express and / or Fat Bar concepts (serving beer, wine, spirits and cocktails). 
● | Drive Store Growth through Co-Branding, Virtual Restaurants, and Cloud Kitchens. We franchise co-branded Fatburger / Buffalo’s Express locations, giving franchisees the flexibility of offering multiple concepts, while sharing kitchen space, resulting in a higher average check (compared to stand-alone Fatburger locations). Franchisees benefit by serving a broader customer base, and we estimate that co-branding results in a 20%-30% increase in average unit volume compared to stand-alone locations with minimal incremental cost to franchisees. Our acquisition strategy reinforces the importance of co-branding, as we expect to offer each of the complementary brands that we acquire to our existing franchisees on a co-branded basis.

-


 | In addition to driving growth through co-branding opportunities, we are leveraging the current industry trend of virtual restaurants, whereby one (or more) of our brands serves its food out of the kitchen of another brand for online delivery only, and cloud kitchens, whereby restaurants open without a customer-facing store-front solely for the purpose of servicing delivery or virtual kitchens. Virtual restaurants and cloud kitchens allow us to introduce our brands in geographic areas where previously unknown such as introducing selected menu items from Hurricane Grill & Wings to the southern California market through the preparation in and delivery from Fatburger franchised restaurants via a program with UberEats. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Extend Brands into New Segments. We have a strong track record of extending our brands into new segments, and we believe that we have a significant opportunity to capture new markets by strategically adapting our concepts while reinforcing the brand identity. In addition to dramatically expanding the traditional Buffalo’s Cafe customer base through Fatburger / Buffalo’s Express co-branding, we have also begun evaluating opportunities to leverage the Buffalo’s brand by promoting Buffalo’s Express on a stand-alone basis. Furthermore, we have also begun the roll-out of Fat Bars (serving beer, wine, spirits and cocktails), which we are opportunistically introducing to select existing Fatburger locations on a modular basis. Similarly, we plan to create smaller-scale, fast casual Ponderosa and Bonanza concepts, to drive new store growth, particularly internationally. 
● | Continue Expanding FAT Brands Internationally. We have a significant global presence, with international franchised stores in Canada, China, Qatar, Taiwan, Iraq, the United Kingdom, Indonesia, Tunisia, Singapore, Philippines, Panama, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Japan, Pakistan, and Egypt. We believe that the appeal of our Fresh, Authentic, and Tasty concepts is global, and we are targeting further penetration of Middle Eastern and Asian markets, particularly through leveraging the Buffalo’s, Ponderosa and Hurricane brands. 
● | Enhance Footprint in Existing Markets through Current Franchisee Networks. We had 158 franchisees who collectively operated more than 334 restaurants as of December 30, 2018. As noted, our existing and new franchisees have made new store commitments of over 200 locations across our brands, and we anticipate that our new and existing franchisees will open more than 30 new stores annually for at least the next four years. Beyond these existing commitments, we have found that many of our franchisees have grown their businesses over time, increasing the number of stores operated in their organizations and expanding their concept offerings across the FAT Brands portfolio of concepts. 
● | Attract New Franchisees in Existing and Unpenetrated Markets. In addition to the large pipeline of new store commitments from current franchisees, we believe the existing markets for Fatburger, Buffalo’s Cafe, Buffalo’s Express, Ponderosa, Bonanza, Hurricane, and Yalla locations are far from saturated and can support a significant increase in units. Furthermore, new franchisee relationships represent the optimal way for our brands to penetrate geographic markets where we do not currently operate. In many cases, prospective franchisees have experience in and knowledge of markets where we are not currently active, facilitating a smoother brand introduction than we or our existing franchisees could achieve independently. We generate franchisee leads through various channels, including franchisee referrals, traditional and non-traditional franchise brokers and broker networks, franchise development advertising, and franchise trade shows and conventions. 

Franchise Program – FAT Brands
 
General. We utilize a franchise development strategy as our primary method for new store growth by leveraging the interest of our existing franchisees and those potential franchisees with an entrepreneurial spirit looking to launch their own business. We have a rigorous franchisee qualification and selection process to ensure that each franchisee meets our strict brand standards.

Fatburger Franchise Agreements. For Fatburger locations, the current franchise agreement provides for an initial franchise fee of $50,000 per store ($65,000 per store internationally) and a royalty fee of 2% to 6% of net sales on a 15-year term. For 2018, the average royalty rate was 4.9%. In addition, the franchisee must also pay an advertising fee of approximately 3% of net sales on local marketing and approximately 1% of net sales on international marketing.
 
Buffalo’s Franchise Agreements. For Buffalo’s Cafe and Buffalo’s Express locations, the current franchise agreement provides for an initial franchise fee of $50,000 per store and a royalty fee of 2.5% to 6% of gross sales on a 15-year term. For 2018, the average royalty rate was 3.9%. In addition, the Buffalo’s Cafe franchisee agrees to pay an advertising fee of 2% of net sales on local marketing and 2% of net sales to the Buffalo’s Cafe advertising fund. For Buffalo’s Express locations, the franchisee pays approximately 1% of net sales on local store marketing and approximately 3% of net sales to the Buffalo’s Express advertising fund.

Yalla Mediterranean Franchise Agreements. Prior to our acquisition of Yalla Mediterranean in December 2018, the brand did not have a franchising program. We are currently in the process of converting the seven existing Yalla restaurants to franchise locations and developing a worldwide franchising effort similar to those of our other brands.
 
Development Agreements. We use development agreements to facilitate the planned expansion of Fatburger and Buffalo’s restaurants through single and multiple unit development. During 2018, almost all of our new Fatburger and Buffalo’s openings occurred as a result of existing development agreements. Each development agreement gives a developer the exclusive right to construct, own and operate Fatburger or Buffalo’s stores within a defined area. In exchange, the franchisee agrees to open a minimum number of stores in the area in a prescribed time period. Franchisees that enter into development agreements are required to pay a fee, which is credited against franchise fees due when the store is opened in the future. Franchisees may forfeit such fees and lose their rights to future development if they do not maintain the required schedule of openings.
 
Franchisee Support – FAT Brands
 
Marketing
 
Our Fresh, Authentic and Tasty values are the anchor that inspires our marketing efforts. Our resolve to maintain our premium positioning, derived from the FAT Brands’ values, is reinforced by our management platform, capital light business model, experienced and diverse global franchisee network and seasoned and passionate management team. Although our marketing and advertising programs are concept-specific, we believe that our patrons appreciate the value of their experiences visiting our establishments and, thus, the core of our marketing strategy is to engage and dialogue with customers at our restaurant locations as well as through social media.
 
Our Fresh, Authentic and Tasty values are an invitation for our guests to align with FAT Brands’ commitment to consistently deliver freshly prepared, made-to-order food that customers desire. We are dedicated to keeping a fresh perspective on our concepts, perfecting our existing menu offerings as well as introducing appealing new items. We ensure that any changes are consistent with the core identity of our brands, and we will not adapt our brands to be all things to all people.

Our marketing initiatives include a robust mix of local community marketing, in-store campaigns, product placements, partnerships, promotions, social media, influencer marketing, traditional media and word of mouth advertising. Corresponding with the evolutionary shift in how customers receive content and engage with media and brands today, we have also dramatically increased our focus on mobile, social, and digital advertising to leverage the content we generate from public relations and experiential marketing in order to better connect with customers, sharing information about new menu offerings, promotions, new store openings and other relevant FAT Brands information. Currently, across our brands, we have over 17,500 Twitter followers, 75,000 Instagram followers and over 1,000,000 Facebook likes. We communicate with customers in creative and organic ways that fortify our connections with them and increase brand awareness.
 
Site Selection and Development.
 
Our franchisees work alongside our franchise development department during the search, review, leasing and development process for a new restaurant location. Typically, it takes between 60 and 90 days from the time we sign an agreement with a franchisee until that franchisee signs a lease. When selecting a location, our team assists franchisees in seeking locations with the following site characteristics:

● | Average Daily Traffic: 35,000+ people 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Access: Easy, distinguishable, and preferably with signaled entry and intersection; two-to-three curb cuts to center and entry from two streets 
● | Activity Generators: Going home traffic side, easily accessible for lunchtime traffic (pedestrian and automobile), high-frequency specialty retail and storefront urban corridors with convenient parking 
● | Lease Terms: Five-year minimum with four five-year options; fixed rates preferred 
● | Visibility: Site and signage must be highly visible from street and/or traffic generators, ideally visible from at least 500 feet in two directions 

Supply Chain Assistance
 
FAT Brands has always been committed to seeking out and working with best-in-class suppliers and distribution networks. Our Fresh, Authentic and Tasty vision guides us in how we source and develop our ingredients, always looking for the best ways to provide top quality food that is as competitively priced as possible for our franchisees and customers. We utilize a third-party purchasing and consulting company that provides distribution, rebate collection, product negotiations, audits and sourcing services focusing on negotiating distributor, vendor and manufacturer contracts, thereby ensuring that our brands receive meaningful buying power for our franchisees. Our Supply Chain team has developed a reliable supply chain and continues to focus on identifying additional back-ups to avoid any possible interruption of service and product globally. We have a regional strategy for ground beef supply to ensure that we are always serving our proprietary blend of freshly ground and never frozen beef in our stores in the continental United States. Internationally, we utilize the same strategy market-by-market in each country in which our franchisees operate. Only when a fresh never frozen beef option is unavailable do we procure frozen beef, which is then freshly ground in stores. Domestically, we have the same, Southern California based, beef supplier for all of our U.S. Fatburger locations. We have the same, South East United States based, beef supplier for Buffalo’s Cafe. Ponderosa and Bonanza Steakhouses utilize contracted beef suppliers as does our Hurricane brand. Internationally, we have a select group of beef suppliers providing product to our franchisees market-by-market for each brand. We utilize the same procurement strategies for our poultry (chicken and turkey), veggie, hotdog and Mediterranean offerings.
 
Domestically, FAT Brands has distribution agreements with broadline national distributors as well as regional providers. Internationally, our franchisees have distribution agreements with different providers market-by-market. We utilize distribution centers operated by our distributors. Our broadline national distributors are the main purchasing link in the United States among many of our suppliers, and distribute most of our dry, refrigerated and frozen goods, non-alcoholic beverages, paper goods and cleaning supplies. Internationally, distributors are also used to provide the majority of products to our franchisees.
 
Food Safety and Quality Assurance. Food safety is a top priority of FAT Brands. As such, we maintain rigorous safety standards for our menu offerings. We have carefully selected preferred suppliers that adhere to our safety standards, and our franchisees are required to source their ingredients from these approved suppliers. Furthermore, our commitment to food safety is strengthened through the direct relationship between our Supply Chain and Field Consultant Assistance teams.

Management Information Systems. FAT Brands restaurants utilize a variety of back-office, computerized and manual, point-of-sale systems and tools, which we believe are scalable to support our growth plans. We utilize these systems following a multi-faceted approach to monitor restaurants operational performance, food safety, quality control, customer feedback and profitability.
 
The point-of-sale systems are designed specifically for the restaurant industry and we use many customized features to evaluate and increase operational performance, provide data analysis, marketing promotional tracking, guest and table management, high-speed credit card and gift card processing, daily transaction data, daily sales information, product mix, average transaction size, order modes, revenue centers and other key business intelligence data. Utilizing these point-of-sale systems back-end, web-based, enterprise level, software solution dashboards, our home office and Franchise Operations Consultant Support staff are provided with real-time access to detailed business data which allows for our home office and Franchise Operations Consultant Support staff to closely, and remotely, monitor stores performance and assist in providing focused and timely support to our franchisees. Furthermore, these systems supply sales, bank deposit and variance data to our accounting department on a daily basis, and we use this data to generate daily sales information and weekly consolidated reports regarding sales and other key measures for each restaurant with final reports following the end of each period.
 
In addition to utilizing these point-of-sale systems, FAT Brands utilizes systems which provide detailed, real-time (and historical) operational data for all locations, allowing our management team to track product inventories, equipment temperatures, repair and maintenance schedules, intra-shift team communications, consistency in following standard operating procedures and tracking of tasks. FAT Brands also utilizes a web-based employee scheduling software program providing franchisees, and their management teams, increased flexibility and awareness of scheduling needs allowing them to efficiently, and appropriately, manage their labor costs and store staffing requirements/needs. Lastly, FAT Brands utilizes a proprietary customer feedback system allowing customers to provide feedback in real-time to our entire management team, franchisees and store managers.
 
Field Consultant Assistance.
 
In conjunction with utilizing the FAT Brands Management Information Systems, FAT Brands has a team of dedicated Franchise Operations Consultant Support staff who oversee designated market areas and specific subsets of restaurants. Our Franchise Operations Consultant Support staff work in the field daily with franchisees, and their management teams, to ensure that the integrity of all FAT Brands concepts are upheld and that franchisees are utilizing the tools and systems FAT Brands requires in order to optimize and accelerate franchisee profitability. FAT Brands Franchise Operations Consultant Support staff responsibilities include (but are not limited to):

● | Conducting announced and un-announced store visits and evaluations 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Continuous training and re-training of new and existing franchise operations 
● | Conducting quarterly workshops for franchisees and their management teams 
● | Development and collection of monthly profit and loss statements for each store 
● | Store set-up, training, oversight and support for pre- and post- new store openings 
● | Training, oversight and implementation of in-store marketing initiatives 
● | Inspections of equipment, temperatures, food-handling procedures, customer service, products in store, cleanliness, and team member attitude 

Training, Pre-Opening Assistance and Opening Support
 
FAT Brands offers Executive level and Operational level training programs to its franchisees, pre-opening assistance and opening assistance. Once open, FAT Brands constantly provides ongoing operational and marketing support to our franchisees by assisting their management teams in effectively operating their restaurants and increasing their stores financial profitability.

Competition
 
As a franchisor, our most important customers are our franchisees, who own and operate FAT Brands restaurants. Our direct competitors for franchisees include well-established national, regional or local franchisors with franchises in the geographies or restaurant segments in which we operate or in which we intend to operate.
 
Our franchisees compete in the fast casual and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry, a highly competitive industry in terms of price, service, location, and food quality. The restaurant industry is often affected by changes in consumer trends, economic conditions, demographics, traffic patterns, and concern about the nutritional content of fast casual foods. Furthermore, there are many well-established competitors with substantially greater financial resources, including a number of national, regional, and local fast casual, casual dining, and convenience stores. The restaurant industry also has few barriers to entry and new competitors may emerge at any time.

Food safety is a top priority. As such, we maintain rigorous safety standards for each menu item. We have carefully selected preferred food suppliers that adhere to our safety standards, and our franchisees are required to source their ingredients from these approved suppliers.
Seasonality
 
Our franchisees have not historically experienced significant seasonal variability in their financial performance.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We own, domestically and internationally, valuable intellectual property including trademarks, service marks, trade secrets and other proprietary information related to our restaurant and corporate brands. This intellectual property includes logos and trademarks which are of material importance to our business. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks and service marks generally are valid as long as they are used and/or registered. We seek to actively protect and defend our intellectual property from infringement and misuse.
Employees
 
As of December 30, 2018, our company, including our subsidiaries, employed approximately 44 people. We believe that we have good relations with our employees.
 
Government Regulation
 
U.S. Operations. Our U.S. operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting our business, primarily laws and regulations concerning the franchisor/franchisee relationship, marketing, food labeling, sanitation and safety. Each of our franchised restaurants in the U.S. must comply with licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, which include health, sanitation, safety, fire and zoning agencies in the state and/or municipality in which the restaurant is located. To date, we have not been materially adversely affected by such licensing and regulation or by any difficulty, delay or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals.
 
International Operations. Our restaurants outside the U.S. are subject to national and local laws and regulations which are similar to those affecting U.S. restaurants. The restaurants outside the U.S. are also subject to tariffs and regulations on imported commodities and equipment and laws regulating foreign investment, as well as anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws.
 
See “Risk Factors” for a discussion of risks relating to federal, state, local and international regulation of our business.
