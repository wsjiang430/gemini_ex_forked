Myrtle Grove Share Purchase and Subscription Agreement
On July 26, 2019 (the “MG Closing Date”), Vertex Refining Myrtle Grove LLC (“MG SPV”), a Delaware limited liability company, which entity was formed as a special purpose vehicle in connection with the transactions, described in greater detail below, Vertex Operating, LLC, our wholly-owned subsidiary (“Vertex Operating”), Tensile-Myrtle Grove Acquisition Corporation (“Tensile-MG”), an affiliate of Tensile Capital Partners Master Fund LP, an investment fund based in San Francisco, California (“Tensile”), and solely for the purposes of the MG Guaranty (defined below), the Company, entered into and closed the transactions contemplated by a Share Purchase and Subscription Agreement (the “MG Share Purchase”).
Prior to entering into the MG Share Purchase, Vertex Operating’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Vertex Refining LA, LLC, (“Vertex LA”), transferred all of the operating assets owned by it and related to the planned development of the MG Refinery (as defined below), which the parties agreed had a fair market value of $22,666,667, to MG SPV in consideration for 21,667 Class A Units and 1,000 Class B Units of MG SPV, which units were distributed to Vertex Operating. At the closing of the MG Share Purchase (on the MG Closing Date), Vertex Operating sold 1,000 of the Class B Units to Tensile-MG in consideration of the payment to it of $1 million by Tensile-MG, and Tensile-MG purchased an additional 3,000 Class B Units directly from MG SPV for $3 million (less Tensile’s fees and expenses incurred in connection with the transaction, totaling $850,000).

As a result of the transaction, Tensile, through Tensile-MG, acquired an approximate 15% ownership interest in MG SPV, which owns the Company’s former Belle Chasse, Louisiana, re-refining complex (the “MG Refinery”). Vertex Operating owned the remaining 85% of MG SPV, but has since acquired 100% of MG SPV for $7.2 million, on April 1, 2022.

Heads of Agreement

On January 10, 2020, Vertex Operating entered into a Heads of Agreement (the “Heads of Agreement”) with Bunker One (USA) Inc., which is owned by Bunker Holding, a Danish holding company (“Bunker One”). Pursuant to the Heads of Agreement, the Company and Bunker One agreed to form a joint decision-making body (the “JDMB”) to focus on strategic matters related to the overall cooperation of the parties and to establish rules and procedures for identifying and undertaking joint projects. The JDMB has six members, three each from the Company and Bunker One.

The goal of the parties, pursuant to the Heads of Agreement and the JDMB, is to jointly develop and acquire direct or indirect equity or equity-related interests in projects and companies in the marine fuel sector in North America, with Bunker One focusing on opportunities related to the supply and optimization of marine fuels or components and the Company focusing on business opportunities relating to refining of bunker fuels.

For each project that the parties agree to pursue, the parties will enter into a form of Co-Operation and Joint Supply and Marketing Agreement (each a “Co-Operation JSMA”). The principal objective of each such Co-Operation JSMA will be the expansion of the business of each party by cooperating in the sourcing, storing, transportation, marketing and selling of products, where: (a) Vertex is primarily responsible for the sourcing and storing of the product (bunker fuels); (b) Bunker One is primarily responsible for the transporting, blending, marketing, selling and delivering of the product (bunker fuels); (c) Bunker One is responsible for the risk management/exposure (e.g. hedging) of the bunker fuels; and (d) Bunker One is the exclusive seller of the product to third parties.

The Heads of Agreement also allows for certain projects outside of the scope of Co-Operation JSMA’s which will be subject to separate Authorization for Expenditures agreed to by the JDMB.

The Heads of Agreement has a term of ten years, beginning effective on January 1, 2020, and continuing through April 30, 2029, provided that the agreement extends for additional five-year periods thereafter unless either party provides the other at least 120 days’ notice of non-renewal before any such automatic renewal date. The agreement can also be terminated by either party upon an event of default (as described in the Heads of Agreement), subject to required thirty days’ notice of such event of default and the opportunity for the breaching party to cure. The Heads of Agreement contains standard and customary events of default, including failure to pay amounts when due, failure to comply with the terms of the agreement, insolvency and the occurrence of a Change of Control, each subject to the terms of the agreement. A Change of Control is defined in the agreement as any party (a) engaged in the bunkering business (i.e., the supplying of fuel used by ships), as to Bunker One, or (b) engaged in the refining business, as to Vertex, obtaining control of such applicable party by way of any transaction or series of transactions.

The Heads of Agreement also contains a right of first refusal provision, whereby if at any time Bunker One, or any of its U.S. affiliates (each a “Bunker One Party”), proposes to issue, sell, transfer, assign, or otherwise directly or indirectly dispose of (x) all or any substantial portion of its bunkering business in the United States, or, if mutually agreed, outside of the United States and/or (y) the controlling equity interests in any corporation, limited liability company or partnership that owns all or any substantial portion of the bunkering business, held by such Bunker One Party for value, the Bunker One Party is required to provide the Company written notice of such event and the Company is provided the right to make an offer to purchase such entity/assets, from such Bunker One Party, subject to the terms of the Heads of Agreement.
Additionally, under the Heads of Agreement, at any time Bunker One determines to extend its existing bunkering business to any port in North America that is not served by Bunker One as of August 1, 2019, Bunker One is required to extend to the Company the right to elect to expand the terms and conditions of the Heads of Agreement to include any such new port.

Finally, under the Heads of Agreement, if at any time the Company acquires a supply of material that the Company intends to sell in Texas, Louisiana or Alabama and that is suitable for use in Bunker One’s bunkering business in such area from a third party, or produces additional material for sale in such area, the Company is required to provide Bunker One the right to purchase such supply/material pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Heads of Agreement.

JSMA

Also, on January 10, 2020, Vertex Operating entered into a Joint Supply and Marketing Agreement (the “JSMA”), with Bunker One. The JSMA is effective as of May 1, 2020, and provides for Bunker One to acquire 100% of the production from the Company’s Marrero, Louisiana re-refining facility (which produces approximately 100,000 barrels per month of a bunker suitable fuel for offshore use and use as a marine vessel’s propulsion system (“Bunker Fuel”)) at the arithmetic mean of Platts #2 USGC Pipe and Platt’s ULSD USGC Waterborne on agreed pricing days less an agreed upon discount, adjusted every three months.

Pursuant to the JSMA, the parties agreed to the percentages pursuant to which net profit will be split between the parties, relating to the sale of such Bunker Fuel by Bunker One, which is to be sold in Texas, Louisiana, Alabama and areas immediately adjacent thereto if mutually agreed (collectively, the “Area”).

Pursuant to the JSMA, (i) the Company is primarily responsible for the sourcing and storing of the feedstock which is used to produce the Bunker Fuel, (ii) Bunker One is primarily responsible for the transporting, blending, marketing, selling and delivering of the Bunker Fuel, (iii) Bunker One is responsible for the risk management/exposure (e.g., hedging) of the Bunker Fuel, and (iv) Bunker One is the exclusive seller of the Bunker Fuel to third parties.

The Bunker Fuel is meant for blending by Bunker One into other products for the purpose of being transformed into bunker suitable fuel for a marine vessel’s propulsion system and/or marketable wholesale products in various other markets for sale by Bunker One to customers in the Area.

Pursuant to the JSMA, the Company agreed that during the term of the agreement, neither the Company, nor any affiliate of the Company, would sell any Bunker Fuel to any customers for their use as bunker fuel other than pursuant to the terms of the Agreement.

Payment for the Bunker Fuel is required to be made by Bunker One within three days after invoiced by the Company, and at the end of each three months during the term of the agreement, Bunker One is required to provide a detailed accounting 
to the Company setting forth the consideration due to the Company and the calculation of such amounts. The agreement also provides for a yearly accounting by Bunker One and true up of amounts paid and due throughout such year.

The JSMA has a term from May 1, 2020 to April 30, 2029, provided that the term is automatically renewable for additional five-year periods thereafter unless either party provides the other at least 120 days prior written notice of non-renewal, prior to any automatic renewal date. The agreement can also be terminated by either party upon an event of default (as described in the JSMA), subject to required ten days’ notice of such event of default and the opportunity for the breaching party to cure. The Heads of Agreement contains standard and customary events of default, including failure to pay amounts when due, failure to comply with the terms of the agreement and insolvency, each subject to the terms of the agreement. In the event that the individual or group of individuals who ultimately own or control each party or such party’s parent as of May 1, 2020 no longer has the right or ability to control or cause the direction of the management and policies of such entity, the agreement can be terminated immediately by the party not subject to such change of control.
The JSMA prohibits either party from promoting activities which compete against the other party’s business in the Area for the term of the agreement and for two years thereafter.

Heartland Share Purchase and Subscription Agreement

On January 17, 2020 (the “Heartland Closing Date”), a Share Purchase and Subscription Agreement (the “Heartland Share Purchase”) by and among HPRM LLC (“Heartland SPV”), a Delaware limited liability company, which entity was formed as a special purpose vehicle in connection with the transactions, described in greater detail below, Vertex Operating, Tensile-Heartland Acquisition Corporation (“Tensile-Heartland”), an affiliate of Tensile, and solely for the purposes of the Heartland Guaranty (defined below), the Company, was entered into.

Prior to entering into the Heartland Share Purchase, the Company transferred 100% of the ownership of Vertex Refining OH, LLC, its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary (“Vertex OH”) to Heartland SPV in consideration for 13,500 Class A Units, 13,500 Class A-1 Preferred Units and 11,300 Class B Units of Heartland SPV and immediately thereafter contributed 248 Class B Units to Vertex Splitter, as a contribution to capital.

Vertex OH owns the Company’s Columbus, Ohio, Heartland facility, which produces a base oil product that is sold to lubricant packagers and distributors.

Pursuant to the Heartland Share Purchase, Vertex Operating sold Tensile-Heartland the 13,500 Class A Units and 13,500 Class A-1 Preferred Units of Heartland SPV in consideration for $13.5 million. Also, on the Heartland Closing Date, Tensile-Heartland purchased 7,500 Class A Units and 7,500 Class A-1 Units in consideration for $7.5 million directly from Heartland SPV.

Concurrently with the closing of the transactions described above, and pursuant to the terms of the Heartland Share Purchase, the Company, through Vertex Operating, purchased 1,000 newly issued Class A Units from MG SPV at a cost of $1,000 per unit ($1 million in aggregate).

Recent Transactions
Mobile Refinery Acquisition
Effective April 1, 2022, we completed the acquisition of a 75,000 bpd crude oil refinery ten miles north of Mobile, in Saraland, Alabama (the “Mobile Refinery”) and related logistics assets, which include a deep-water draft, bulk loading terminal facility with 600,000 Bbls of storage capacity for crude oil and associated refined petroleum products located in Mobile, Alabama (the “Blakeley Island Terminal”). The terminal includes a dock for loading and unloading vessels with a pipeline tie-in, as well as the related logistics infrastructure of a high-capacity truck rack with 3-4 loading heads per truck, each rated at 600 gallons per minute (the “Mobile Truck Rack”). The Mobile Refinery currently processes heavy and sour crude to produce heavy olefin feed, regular gasoline, premium gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel fuel.
The Company paid a total of $75.0 million in consideration for the acquisition of the Mobile Refinery. In addition, we paid $16.4 million for previously agreed upon capital expenditures, miscellaneous prepaids and reimbursable items and an $8.7 million technology solution comprising the ecosystem required for the Company to run the Mobile Refinery after the acquisition. The Company also purchased certain crude oil and finished products inventories for $130.2 million owned by Shell at the Mobile Refinery.
As a result of the Mobile Refinery purchase, Vertex Refining and Shell Trading (US) Company (“STUSCO”) entered into a Crude Oil & Hydrocarbon Feedstock Supply Agreement (the “Crude Supply Agreement”) pursuant to which STUSCO agreed to sell to Vertex Refining, NV, LLC (“Vertex Refining”), and Vertex Refining agreed to buy from STUSCO, all of the crude oil and hydrocarbon feedstock requirements of the Mobile Refinery, subject to certain exceptions set forth therein. The agreement provides that STUSCO is the exclusive supplier for the Mobile Refinery’s requirement for crude oil and hydrocarbon feedstock.
Additionally, as a result of the Mobile Refinery purchase, we entered into several agreements with Macquarie Energy North America Trading Inc (“Macquarie”). Under these agreements (together, the “Inventory Financing Agreement”), Macquarie agreed to finance the Mobile Refinery’s crude supply and inventories, and Vertex agrees to provide storage and terminalling services to Macquarie. At the time of the acquisition, Macquarie agreed to finance $124.3 million of the $130.2 million of opening inventories. 
Macquarie Transactions
On April 1, 2022 (the “Commencement Date”), Vertex Refining entered into a Supply and Offtake Agreement (the “Supply and Offtake Agreement”) with Macquarie, pertaining to crude oil supply and offtake of finished products located at the Mobile Refinery acquired on April 1, 2022. On the Commencement Date, pursuant to an Inventory Sales Agreement and in connection with the Supply and Offtake Agreement, Macquarie purchased from Vertex Refining all crude oil and finished products within the categories covered by the Supply and Offtake Agreement and the Inventory Sales Agreement, which were held at the Mobile Refinery and a certain specified third party storage terminal, which were previously purchased by Vertex Refining as part of the acquisition of the Mobile Refinery.
Pursuant to the Supply and Offtake Agreement, beginning on the Commencement Date and subject to certain exceptions, substantially all of the crude oil located at the Mobile Refinery and at a specified third party storage terminal from time to time will be owned by Macquarie prior to its sale to Vertex Refining for consumption within the Mobile Refinery processing units. Also pursuant to the Supply and Offtake Agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions and certain exceptions set forth therein, Macquarie will purchase from Vertex Refining substantially all of the Mobile Refinery’s output of certain refined products and will own such refined products while they are located within certain specified locations at the Mobile Refinery. Macquarie takes title to the refined products stored in our storage tanks until they are sold to our retail locations or to third parties. We record the inventory owned by Macquarie on our behalf as inventory with a corresponding accrued liability on our balance sheet because we maintain the risk of loss until the refined products are sold to third parties and we have an obligation to repurchase it.
Pursuant to the Supply and Offtake Agreement and subject to the terms and conditions therein, Macquarie may during the term of the Supply and Offtake Agreement procure crude oil and refined products from certain third parties which may be sold to Vertex Refining or third parties pursuant to the Supply and Offtake Agreement and may sell Refined Products to Vertex Refining or third parties (including customers of Vertex Refining).
The obligations of Vertex Refining and any of its subsidiaries under the Supply and Offtake Agreement and related transaction documents are guaranteed by the Company. The obligations of Vertex Refining and any of its subsidiaries under the Supply and Offtake Agreement and related transaction documents are also secured by a Pledge and Security Agreement in favor of Macquarie, discussed below, executed by Vertex Refining. In addition, the Supply and Offtake Agreement also requires that Vertex Refining post and maintain cash collateral (in the form of an independent amount) as security for Vertex Refining’s obligations under the Supply and Offtake Agreement and the related transaction documents. The amount of cash collateral is subject to adjustments during the term.
Pursuant to the Supply and Offtake Agreement, Vertex Refining and Macquarie are in discussions to cooperate to develop and document, procedures relating to the unwinding and termination of the agreement and related agreements, in the event of the expiration or early termination of the Supply and Offtake Agreement. The parties also agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate mutually agreeable terms for Macquarie’s intermediating of renewable feedstocks and renewable diesel that will be utilized and/or produced by Vertex Refining in connection with and following a planned renewable diesel conversion project at the Mobile Refinery (including providing Macquarie a right of first refusal in connection therewith), for 90 days after the Commencement Date (the “RD Period”), which discussions are ongoing. If, by the end of the RD Period, Macquarie and Vertex Refining, each acting in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, have not been able to reach commercial agreement regarding the entry into a renewable diesel intermediation, Vertex Refining may elect to terminate the Supply and Offtake Agreement by providing notice of any such election to Macquarie; provided that no such election may be effective earlier than the date falling 90 calendar days following the date on which such notice is delivered. The agreement is also subject to termination upon the occurrence of certain events, including the termination of certain agreements relating to the delivery of crude oil to and the offtake of products from the Mobile Refinery. Upon an early termination of the Supply and Offtake Agreement, Vertex Refining is required to pay amounts relating to such termination to Macquarie including, among other things, outstanding unpaid amounts, amounts owing with respect to terminating transactions under the Supply and Offtake Agreement and related transaction documents, unpaid ancillary costs, and breakage costs, losses and out-of-pocket costs with respect to the termination, liquidation, maintenance or reestablishment, or redeployment of certain hedges put in place by Macquarie in connection with the transactions contemplated by the agreement, and Vertex Refining is required to pay other termination fees and amounts to Macquarie in the event of any termination of the agreement. Additionally, upon the termination of the Supply and Offtake Agreement, the outstanding obligations of Vertex Refining and Macquarie to each other will be calculated and reduced to an estimated net settlement payment which will be subject to true-up when the final settlement payment has been calculated following termination.
The Supply and Offtake Agreement requires Vertex Refining to prepare and deliver certain forecasts, projections and estimates and comply with financial statement delivery obligations and other disclosure obligations. The agreement also requires Vertex Refining to provide Macquarie notice of certain estimated monthly crude oil delivery, crude oil consumption, product production, target inventory levels and product offtake terms, which Macquarie has the right to reject, subject to certain disclosure requirements.
The Supply and Offtake Agreement has a 24 month term following the Commencement Date, subject to the performance of customary covenants, and certain events of default and termination events provided therein (certain of which are discussed in greater detail below), for a facility of this size and type. Additionally, either party may terminate the agreement at any time, for any reason, with no less than 180 days prior notice to the other.
The price for crude oil purchased by the Company from Macquarie and for products sold by the Company to Macquarie within each agreed product group, in each case, is equal to a pre-determined benchmark, plus a pre-agreed upon differential, subject to adjustments and monthly true-ups.
Vertex Refining is required to pay Macquarie various monthly fees in connection with the Supply and Offtake Agreement and related arrangements, including, without limitation, (1) an inventory management fee, calculated based on the value of the inventory owned by Macquarie in connection with the Supply and Offtake Agreement, (2) a lien inventory fee based upon the value of certain inventory on which Macquarie has a lien, (3) a per barrel crude handling fee based upon the volume of crude oil Macquarie sells to Vertex Refining, (4) per barrel crude oil and products intermediation fees for each barrel of crude oil which Macquarie buys from a third party and each barrel of products Macquarie sells to a third party, in each case, in connection with the Supply and Offtake Agreement, and (5) a services fee in respect of which Macquarie agrees to make Crude Oil and Products available to the Company in accordance with the weekly nomination procedure as set forth in the 
Supply and Offtake Agreement. Vertex Refining will also be responsible for certain payments relating to Macquarie’s hedging of the inventory it owns in connection with the Supply and Offtake Agreement, including the costs of rolling hedges forward each month, as well as any costs (or gains) resulting from a mismatch between the Company’s projected target inventory levels (which provide the basis for Macquarie’s hedge position) and actual month end inventory levels.
In connection with the entry into the Supply and Offtake Agreement, Vertex Refining entered into various ancillary agreements which relate to supply, storage, marketing and sales of crude oil and refined products including, but not limited to the following: Inventory Sales Agreement, Master Crude Oil and Products Agreement, Storage and Services Agreement, and a Pledge and Security Agreement (collectively with the Supply and Offtake Agreement, the “Supply Transaction Documents”).
The Company agreed to guarantee the obligations of Vertex Refining and any of its subsidiaries arising under the Supply Transaction Documents pursuant to the entry into a Guaranty in favor of Macquarie.
Also on the Commencement Date, Vertex Refining, Macquarie and certain parties subject to crude oil supply and products offtake agreements with Vertex Refining, relating to the Mobile Refinery, entered into various tripartite agreements (the “Tripartite Agreements”), whereby Vertex Refining granted Macquarie the right, on a rolling daily or monthly basis, as applicable, to elect to assume Vertex Refining’s rights and obligations under such crude oil supply and products offtake agreements in connection with the performance of the Supply and Offtake Agreement, and the counterparties thereto are deemed to have consented to Macquarie’s assuming such obligations. Such Tripartite Agreements also provided for certain interpretations of the provisions of such supply and offtake agreements between Vertex Refining and such third parties in connection with Macquarie’s right to elect to assume Vertex Refining’s rights and obligations under such agreements. The Tripartite Agreements remain in place until the termination of the agreements to which they relate, or the earlier termination thereof as set forth in the Tripartite Agreements, including in the event of certain events of default by the parties thereto under the modified crude oil supply and products offtake agreements or the Supply and Offtake Agreement and related transaction documents and also in the event of the termination of the Supply and Offtake Agreement. Macquarie, Vertex Refining and a third party offtaker also entered into a tripartite agreement pursuant to which certain storage capacity within the Mobile Refinery which Macquarie had leased pursuant to the Storage and Services Agreement was effectively made available to such third party consistent with the terms agreed by such party and Vertex Refining in its underlying products offtake agreement. Macquarie, Vertex Refining and a third party storage terminal operator also entered into a tripartite agreement relating to the storage of Macquarie-owned crude oil in such terminal in connection with the Supply and Offtake Agreement.
Vertex Refining’s obligations under the Supply and Offtake Agreement and related transaction documents (other than the hedges which are secured and guaranteed on a pari passu basis under the Loan and Security Agreement) were unconditionally guaranteed by the Company pursuant to the terms of a Guaranty entered into on April 1, 2022, by the Company in favor of Macquarie (the “Guaranty”).
Term Loan
On April 1, 2022 (the “Closing Date”), Vertex Refining; the Company, as a guarantor; substantially all of the Company’s direct and indirect subsidiaries, as guarantors (together with the Company, the “Initial Guarantors”); certain funds and accounts under management by BlackRock Financial Management, Inc. or its affiliates, as lenders (“BlackRock”), certain funds managed or advised by Whitebox Advisors, LLC, as lenders (“Whitebox”), certain funds managed by Highbridge Capital Management, LLC, as lenders (“Highbridge”), Chambers Energy Capital IV, LP, as a lender (“Chambers”), CrowdOut Capital LLC, as a lender (“CrowdOut Capital”), CrowdOut Credit Opportunities Fund LLC, as a lender (collectively with BlackRock, Whitebox, Highbridge, Chambers and CrowdOut Capital, the “Lenders”); and Cantor Fitzgerald Securities, in its capacity as administrative agent and collateral agent for the Lenders (the “Agent”), entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the “Loan and Security Agreement”).
Pursuant to the Loan and Security Agreement, the Lenders agreed to provide a $125 million term loan to Vertex Refining (the “Initial Term Loan”), the proceeds of which, less agreed upon fees and discounts, were held in escrow prior to the Closing Date, pursuant to an Escrow Agreement. On the Closing Date, net proceeds from the term loans, less the agreed upon fees and discounts, as well as certain transaction expenses, were released from escrow to Vertex Refining in an aggregate amount of $94 million.
On May 26, 2022, each of the Initial Guarantors (including the Company), Vertex Refining OH, LLC, which is indirectly wholly-owned by the Company ("Vertex OH"), Heartland SPV, and Tensile-Heartland Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“Tensile-Heartland”, and together with Vertex Ohio and Heartland SPV, the “Additional Guarantors”, and the Additional Guarantors, together with the Initial Guarantors, the “Guarantors”, and the Guarantors, together with Vertex Refining, the “Loan Parties”), entered into an Amendment Number One to Loan and Security Agreement (“Amendment No.

Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)
The COVID-19 pandemic and actions of governments and others in response thereto previously resulted in significant business and operational disruptions, including business closures, supply chain disruptions, travel restrictions, stay-at-home orders, and limitations on the availability and effectiveness of the workforce. The worldwide vaccine rollouts in 2021 have allowed governments to ease COVID-19 restrictions and lockdown protocols; and to date, our operations have for the most part been deemed an essential business under applicable governmental orders based on the critical nature of the products we offer.
We experienced a disruption in feedstock supply during 2020, 2021 and 2022 due to COVID-19 and significant volatility in the price of feedstocks and finished products during the same period. Recently the Biden administration has announced that it plans to end COVID-19 national and public health emergency orders on May 11, 2023.
We do not currently expect any material continued impact from COVID-19 moving forward; however, we will continue to evaluate our business operations based on new information as it becomes available and will make changes that we consider necessary in light of any new developments regarding the pandemic.
Description of Business Activities:
We are an energy transition company specializing in refining and marketing high-value conventional and lower-carbon alternative transportation fuels. We are engaged in operations across the petroleum value chain, including refining, collection, aggregation, transportation, storage and sales of aggregated feedstock and refined products to end-users. All of these products are commodities that are subject to various degrees of product quality and performance specifications. 
We operate in two segments: 
(1) Refining and Marketing, and
(2) Black Oil and Recovery.
Our Refining and Marketing segment manages the refining of crude oil and distributes finished products across the southeastern United States through a high-capacity truck rack, together with deep and shallow water distribution points capable of supplying waterborne vessels. 
Our Black Oil and Recovery segment aggregates and manages the re-refinement of used motor oil and other petroleum by-products and sells the re-refined products to end customers. 
Refining and Marketing Segment
Our Refining and Marketing segment is engaged in the refining and distribution petroleum products and includes the Mobile Refinery and related operations. As described above, effective April 1, 2022, we completed the acquisition of the Mobile Refinery, a 75,000 bpd crude oil refinery ten miles north of Mobile, in Saraland, Alabama and related logistics assets, which include a deep-water draft, bulk loading terminal facility with 600,000 Bbls of storage capacity for crude oil and associated refined petroleum products located in Mobile, Alabama (the “Blakeley Island Terminal”). The terminal includes a dock for loading and unloading vessels with a pipeline tie-in, as well as the related logistics infrastructure of a high-capacity truck rack with 3-4 loading heads per truck, each rated at 600 gallons per minute (the “Mobile Truck Rack”). The Mobile Refinery currently processes heavy and sour crude to produce heavy olefin feed, regular gasoline, premium gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel fuel. 
In addition, we aggregate a diverse mix of feedstocks petroleum distillates, transmix and other off-specification chemical products. These feedstock streams are purchased from pipeline operators, refineries, chemical processing facilities and third-party providers. We have a toll-based processing agreement in place with Monument Chemical Port Arthur, LLC (formerly with KMTEX) (“Monument Chemical”) to re-refine feedstock streams, under our direction, into various end products that we specify. Monument Chemical uses industry standard processing technologies to re-refine our feedstocks into pygas, gasoline blendstock and marine fuel cutterstock. We sell all of our re-refined products directly to end-customers or to processing facilities for further refinement. In addition, we are distributing refined motor fuels such as gasoline, blended gasoline products and diesel used as engine fuels, to third party customers who typically resell these products to retailers and end consumers.
Black Oil and Recovery Segment
Discontinued operations of Vertex include our Heartland Assets and Operations, which is part of our Black Oil business, Refer to “Part II” – “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”, Note 24, “Discontinued Operations” for additional information. 
Our Black Oil business is engaged in operations across the entire used motor oil recycling value chain including collection, aggregation, transportation, storage, refinement, and sales of aggregated feedstock and re-refined products to end users. We collect and purchase used oil directly from generators such as oil change service stations, automotive repair shops, manufacturing facilities, petroleum refineries, and petrochemical manufacturing operations. We own a fleet of 65 collection vehicles, which routinely visit generators to collect and purchase used motor oil and perform other collection services. We also aggregate used oil from a diverse network of approximately 30 suppliers who operate similar collection businesses to ours.
We manage the logistics of transport, storage and delivery of used oil to our customers. We own a fleet of 25 transportation trucks and more than 80 aboveground storage tanks with over 8.0 million gallons of storage capacity. These assets are used by both the Black Oil segment and the Refining and Marketing segment. In addition, we also utilize third parties for the transportation and storage of used oil feedstocks. Typically, we sell used oil to our customers in bulk to ensure efficient delivery by truck, rail, or barge. In many cases, we have contractual purchase and sale agreements with our suppliers and customers, respectively. We believe these contracts are beneficial to all parties involved because it ensures that a minimum volume is sold from collectors and generators, a minimum volume is purchased by our customers, and we are able to minimize our inventory risk by a spread between the costs to acquire used oil and the revenues received from the sale and delivery of used oil. All contracts are treated as normal purchase normal sale. Also, as discussed above under “Description of Business Activities”, from time to time, when market conditions warrant (i.e., when oil prices are sufficiently high), we have used our proprietary TCEP technology to re-refine used oil into marine fuel cutterstock. Due to the decline in oil prices and challenges in obtaining feedstock during the first quarter of 2020, we have used TCEP solely to pre-treat our used motor oil feedstock prior to shipping to our facility in Marrero, Louisiana since the first quarter of 2020. In addition, at our Marrero, Louisiana facility, we produce a Vacuum Gas Oil (VGO) product that is sold to refineries as well as to the marine fuels market. At our Columbus, Ohio facility (Heartland Petroleum), divested on February 1, 2023, we produce a base oil product that is sold to lubricant packagers and distributors.
We currently provide our services in 15 states, primarily in the Gulf Coast, Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. For the rolling twelve-month period ending December 31, 2022, we aggregated approximately 86.3 million gallons of used motor oil and other petroleum by-product feedstocks and managed the re-refining of approximately 79.5 million gallons of used motor oil with our proprietary TCEP, VGO and Base Oil processes.
Our Black Oil and Recovery segments include two business lines. The Black Oil business collects and purchases used motor oil directly from third-party generators, aggregates used motor oil from an established network of local and regional collectors, and sells used motor oil to our customers for use as a feedstock or replacement fuel for industrial burners. We operate a refining facility that uses our proprietary TCEP and we also utilize third-party processing facilities. TCEP’s original purpose was to refine used oil into marine cutterstock; however, in the third quarter of fiscal 2015, that use ceased to be economically accretive, and instead, we operated TCEP for the purposes of pre-treating our used motor oil feedstock prior to shipping to our facility in Marrero, Louisiana. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the original purpose of TCEP once again became economically viable and at that time we switched to using TCEP to refine used oil into marine cutterstock; provided that with the decline in oil prices and challenges in obtaining feedstock during early 2020, we switched back to using TCEP for the purposes of pre-treating our used motor oil feedstock prior to shipping to our facility in Marrero, Louisiana, and continuing through the filing date of this Report. Our Recovery business includes a generator solutions company for the proper recovery and management of hydrocarbon streams as well as metals which includes transportation and marine salvage services throughout the Gulf Coast.
We also operate a facility in Marrero, Louisiana, which facility re-refines used motor oil and also produces VGO and a re-refining complex in Belle Chasse, Louisiana, which we call our Myrtle Grove facility.
The Company’s Recovery business includes a generator solutions company for the proper recovery and management of hydrocarbon streams, the sales and marketing of Group III base oils through January 2021, and other petroleum-based products, together with the recovery and processing of metals.
Thermal Chemical Extraction Process
We own the intellectual property for our patented TCEP. TCEP is a technology which utilizes thermal and chemical dynamics to extract impurities from used oil which increases the value of the feedstock. We intend to continue to develop our TCEP technology and design with the goal of producing additional re-refined products, which may include lubricating base oil.
TCEP differs from conventional re-refining technologies, such as vacuum distillation and hydrotreatment, by relying more heavily on chemical processes to remove impurities rather than temperature and pressure. Therefore, the capital requirements to build a TCEP plant are typically much less than a traditional re-refinery because large feed heaters, vacuum distillation columns, and a hydrotreating unit are not required. The end product currently produced by TCEP is used as fuel oil cutterstock. Conventional re-refineries produce lubricating base oils or product grades slightly lower than base oil that can be used as industrial fuels or transportation fuel blendstocks.
We currently estimate the cost to construct a new, fully-functional, commercial facility using our TCEP technology, with annual processing capacity of between 25 and 50 million gallons at another location would be approximately $10 - $15 million, which could fluctuate based on throughput capacity. The facility infrastructure would require additional capitalized expenditures which would depend on the location and site specifics of the facility. Our TCEP technology converts feedstock into a low sulfur marine fuel that can be sold into the new 0.5% low sulfur marine fuel specification mandated under International Maritime Organization (IMO) rules which went into effect on January 1, 2020. As described above, due to the decline in oil prices and challenges in obtaining feedstock in the early part of 2020, we are currently using TCEP for the purposes of pre-treating our used motor oil feedstock prior to shipping to our facility in Marrero, Louisiana. We have no current plans to construct any other TCEP facilities at this time. 
Organizational Structure 
    The following chart reflects our current organization structure, including significant subsidiaries (all of which are wholly-owned, except as discussed below):
Our Industry
Conventional Refining
The petroleum refining industry is a competitive landscape comprising an array of fully integrated national and multinational oil companies that engage in diverse activities within the refining sector. These activities include exploration, 
production, transportation, refining, marketing, retail fuel and convenience stores, and independent refiners. Within the industry, our principal competitors are the petroleum refiners based in the Gulf Coast Region. 
Given the nature of the industry, the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks is a crucial competitive factor that must be continually monitored. We analyze our refinery complexity, efficiency, and product mix to make informed decisions on allocating resources and maximizing our profitability. Distribution and transportation costs are also essential competitive factors that we actively manage in an attempt to minimize our expenses while maintaining the quality of our products. Additionally, regulatory compliance costs such as Renewable Fuel Standards are closely monitored to ensure we remain compliant while working towards minimizing the associated costs.
Used Oil Re-Refining
The used oil recycling industry comprises generators, collectors, aggregators, processors, re-refiners, and end-users. Generators produce used oil through oil changes on vehicles, machinery, and heavy equipment. Collectors are intermediaries who collect used oil from generators and transport it to aggregators, processors, and re-refiners. Aggregators purchase used oil and petroleum by-products from multiple collectors and deliver those as feedstock to processors and re-refiners. Processors and re-refiners convert used oil or petroleum by-products into higher-value feedstock or end-products using vacuum distillation and hydrotreating processes. Re-refined lubricating base oil is of equal quality and lasts as long as virgin base oil, while intermediate products are used as industrial fuels or transportation fuel blend stocks.
The market value of recycled oil is based on its end-use, while the financial and environmental benefits of recycling used oil are dependent on the extent to which the used oil is re-refined, and the price spread between natural gas and crude oil. Environmental regulations prohibit the disposal of used oil in sewers or landfills due to the heavy metals and other contaminants that make it detrimental to the environment if improperly disposed. Re-refined oil significantly reduces the amount of toxic heavy metals, greenhouse gases, and other pollutants introduced into the environment, conserves petroleum that would have otherwise been refined into virgin base stock oil, and is a more environmentally responsible option than burning used oil as an industrial fuel. With the increasing demand for high-quality, environmentally responsible products, we believe that the used oil recycling market has significant growth potential through increasing the percentage of recycled oil that is re-refined rather than burned as a low-cost industrial fuel.
Our Competitive Strengths
Large, Diversified Feedstock Supply Network.
We obtain our feedstock supply through a combination of direct collection activities and purchases from third-party suppliers. We believe our balanced direct and indirect approach to obtaining feedstock is highly advantageous because it enables us to maximize total supply and reduce our reliance on any single supplier and the risk of not fulfilling our minimum feedstock sale quotas. We collect feedstock directly from over 4,500 generators including oil change service stations, automotive repair shops, manufacturing facilities, petroleum refineries and petrochemical manufacturing operations, as well as brokers. We aggregate used oil from a diverse network of approximately 30 suppliers who operate similar collection businesses to ours. 
Strategic Relationships.
We have established relationships with key feedstock suppliers, storage and transportation providers, oil re-refineries, and end-user customers. We believe our relationships with these parties are strong, in part due to our high level of customer service, competitive prices, and our ability to contract (for purchase or sale) long-term, minimum monthly feedstock commitments. We believe that our strategic relationships could lead to contract extensions and expanded feedstock supply or purchase agreements.
Logistics Capabilities.
We have extensive expertise and experience managing and operating feedstock supply chain logistics and multimodal transportation services for customers who purchase our feedstock or higher-value, re-refined products. We believe that our scale, infrastructure, expertise, and contracts enable us to cost effectively transport product and consistently meet our customers’ volume, quality and delivery schedule requirements.
Diversified End Product Sales.
We believe that the diversity of the products we sell reduces our overall risk and exposure to price fluctuations. Prices for petroleum-based products can be impacted significantly by supply and demand fluctuations which are not correlated with general commodity price changes. For instance, in a rising commodity price environment with a significant over-supply of base oil, the price of base oil may fall precipitously while the price of gasoline increases; and in a falling commodity price environment with a shortage of base oil, the price of base oil may increase precipitously while the price of gasoline falls. We offer a diversified product mix consisting of used motor oil, fuel oil, pygas, and gasoline blendstock. We can also control our mix of end products by choosing to either resell collected feedstock or re-refine it into a higher-value product.
Management Team.
We are led by a management team with expertise in petroleum refining, recycling, finance, operations, and re-refinement technology. Each member of our senior management team has more than 23 years of industry experience. We believe the strength of our management team will help our success in the marketplace.
Products and Services
We generate substantially all of our revenue from the sale of eight categories of products and certain services discussed below. All of these products are commodities that are subject to various degrees of product quality and performance specifications.
Distillates
Distillates are finished fuel products such as gasoline, jet fuel and diesel fuels.
Base Oil
Base oil is an oil to which other oils or substances are added to produce a lubricant. Typically, the main substance in lubricants, base oils, are refined from crude oil.
Pygas
Pygas, or pyrolysis gasoline, is a product that can be blended with gasoline as an octane booster or that can be distilled and separated into its components, including benzene and other hydrocarbons.
Industrial Fuel
Industrial fuel is a distillate fuel oil which is typically a blend of lower quality fuel oils. It can include diesel fuels and fuel oils such as No. 1, No. 2 and No. 4 diesel fuels that are historically used for space heating and power generation. Industrial fuel is typically a fuel with low viscosity, as well as low sulfur, ash, and heavy metal content, making it an ideal blending agent.
Oil Collection Services
Oil collection services include the collection, handling, treatment and sales of used motor oil and products which include used motor oil (such as oil filters) which are collected from our customers. 
Metals
Metals consist of recoverable ferrous and non-ferrous recyclable metals from manufacturing and consumption. Scrap metal can be recovered from pipes, barges, boats, building supplies, surplus equipment, tanks, and other items consisting of metal composition. These materials are segregated, processed, cut-up and sent back to a steel mill for re-purposing.
Other re-refinery products
Other re-refinery products include the sales of asphalt, condensate, recovered products, and other petroleum products.
VGO/Marine fuel sales
VGO/Marine fuel sales relate to the sale of low sulfur fuel meeting the criteria for IMO 2020 compliant marine fuels.
The way that the product categories above and our services fit into our two operating segments are described below. For further description of individual products, please refer to the Glossary of terms at the beginning of this document.

(1) The Refining and Marketing segment consists primarily of the sale of refined hydrocarbon products such as gasoline, distillates, jet fuel, intermediates refined at the Mobile Refinery and pygas; and industrial fuels, which are produced at a third-party facility (Monument Chemical).
(2) The Black Oil segment continued operations consist primary of the sale of (a) other re-refinery products, recovered products, and used motor oil; (b) specialty blending and packaging of lubricants, (c) transportation revenues; and (d) the sale of VGO (vacuum gas oil)/marine fuel; (e) petroleum products which include base oil and industrial fuels—which consist of used motor oils, cutterstock and fuel oil generated by our facilities; (f) oil collection services—which consist of used oil sales, burner fuel sales, antifreeze sales and service charges; (g) the sale of other re-refinery products including asphalt, condensate, recovered products, and used motor oil; (h) sale of ferrous and non-ferrous recyclable Metal(s) products that are recovered from manufacturing and consumption; and (i) revenues generated from trading/marketing of Group III Base Oils. On February 1, 2023, the Company sold its Heartland Assets and Operations (which forms a part of the Black Oil segment), and as such, has determined to present only the Company’s Heartland Assets and Operations as discontinued operations.
(3) Other refinery products include the sales of base oil, cutterstock and hydrotreated VGO, LPGs, sulfur and vacuum tower bottoms (VTB).
(4) Metals consist of recoverable ferrous and non-ferrous recyclable metals from manufacturing and consumption. Scrap metal can be recovered from pipes, barges, boats, building supplies, surplus equipment, tanks, and other items consisting of metal composition. These materials are segregated, processed, cut-up and sent back to a steel mill for re-purposing.
(5) Other re-refinery products include the sales of asphalt, condensate, recovered products, and other petroleum products.
Suppliers
In our Refining and Marketing segment we purchase crude oil from third party suppliers and compete for these products in the open market. 
In our Black Oil segment, we conduct business with a number of used oil generators, as well as a large network of suppliers that collect used oil from used oil generators. In our capacity as a collector of used oil, we purchase feedstock from approximately 4,500 businesses, such as oil change service stations, automotive repair shops, manufacturing facilities, petroleum refineries, and petrochemical manufacturing operations, which generate used oil through their operations.
Customers
The Black Oil segment sells used oil, VGO, base oil and other petroleum feedstocks to numerous customers in the Gulf Coast and Midwest regions of the United States. The primary customers of its products are packagers, distributers, 
blenders and industrial burners, as described above as well as re-refiners of the feedstock. The Black Oil segment is party to various feedstock sale agreements whereby we sell used oil feedstock to third parties. The agreements provide for customers to purchase certain minimum gallons of used oil feedstock per month at a price per barrel equal to our direct costs, plus certain commissions, based on the quality and quantity of the used oil we supply.
The Recovery segment does not rely solely on contracts, but mainly on the spot market as well as a strategic network of customers and vendors to support the purchase and sale of its products which are commodities. It also relies on project-based work which it bids on from time to time of which there is no guarantee or assurance of repeat business. 
Competition
All aspects of the energy refining industry are very competitive. We compete with various other refining companies on the Gulf Coast. Our competitors include major integrated, national, and independent energy companies. Many of these competitors have greater financial and technical resources and staff which may allow them to better withstand and react to changing and adverse market conditions. Our profitability is dependent on refined product margins which can fluctuate significantly based on conditions out of our control. In addition, crude supply can have a large impact on profitability. Our refining business sources and obtains all of our crude oil from third-party sources and competes globally for crude oil and feedstocks. 
The industrial waste and brokerage of petroleum products industries are highly competitive. There are numerous small to mid-size firms that are engaged in the collection, transportation, treatment and brokerage of virgin and used petroleum products. Competitors include, but are not limited to: Safety-Kleen, Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Clean Harbors, Inc.), Rio Energy, Inc., Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc., and Origin Americas LLC (formerly Flex Oil Service, LLC). These competitors actively seek to purchase feedstock from local, regional and industrial collectors, refineries, pipelines and other sources. Competition for these feedstocks may result in increasing prices to obtain used motor oil and transmix feedstocks critical to the success of our business. In order to remain competitive, we must control costs and maintain strong relationships with our feedstock suppliers. Our network of generators and collectors minimizes our reliance on any single supplier. A portion of the sales of the collected and aggregated used motor oil product are based on supply contracts which include a range of prices which change based on feedstock quality specifications and volumes. This pricing structure helps to insulate us from inventory risk by ensuring a spread between costs to acquire used motor oil feedstock and the revenues received for delivery of the feedstock. We believe that price and service are the main competitive factors in the used motor oil collection industry. We believe that our ability to accept and transport large volumes of oil year round gives us an advantage over many of our competitors. In addition, we believe that our storage capacity and ability to process the streams of products we receive as well as our ability to transport the end product by barge, rail and truck provide further advantages over many of our competitors.
Employees
The Company works diligently to attract the best talent from a diverse range of sources in order to meet the current and future demands of our business. We have established relationships with trade schools, world-class universities, professional associations and industry groups to proactively attract talent.
We have a strong employee value proposition that leverages our unique culture, collaborative working environment, shared sense of purpose, desire to do the right thing and ground-breaking work to attract talent to our Company. Although we have a broad footprint in our business, our people feel like they are amongst friends and can be themselves. We empower them to find new and better ways of doing things and the scale of our business means that careers can develop in exciting and unexpected directions.
In 2022, we hired 312 new employees at our Company which includes the new employees of our recently acquired Mobile facility. When we hire talent, they tend to stay at the Company. As of February 15, 2023, we employed 497 full-time employees. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. The average employee has 3.6 years of service. 
Seasonality
The industrial hydrocarbon recovery business is seasonal to the extent that it is dependent on streams from seasonal industries. For example, asphalt plants burn recycled waste oil in their process, placing pricing and supply availability constraints on the industry during the good weather construction and road building seasons. In our current markets, road paving typically occurs from late spring to early fall. Therefore, it is somewhat easier to procure certain waste streams during winter months when competition for used motor oil feedstock is historically not as strong. Currently we are seeing increased demand for used motor oil feedstocks throughout the year due to the addition of re-refining technologies in the marketplace.
Governmental Regulation, Including Environmental Regulation and Climate Change
Our operations are subject to stringent United States federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to health and safety or the protection of the environment. Additional laws and regulations, or changes in the interpretations of existing laws and regulations, that affect our business and operations may be adopted, which may in turn impact our financial condition. 
    Additionally, the U.S. Departments of Transportation, Coast Guard and Homeland Security as well as various federal, state, local and foreign agencies exercise broad powers over our transportation operations, generally governing such activities as authorization to engage in motor carrier operations, safety and permits to conduct transportation business. We may also become subject to new or more restrictive regulations that the Departments of Transportation and Homeland Security, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency or other authorities impose, including regulations relating to engine exhaust emissions, the hours of service that our drivers may provide in any one time-period, security and other matters.
Our compliance challenges arise from various legislative and regulatory bodies influenced by political, environmental, health and safety concerns.
For example, changes in federal regulations relating to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether and new sulfur limitations for product shipped in domestic pipelines resulted in tightened specifications of gasoline blendstock that we were refining, causing a corresponding decrease in revenue and gross margin growth during 2016, as compared to prior years. This change in regulation, as well as other emission-related regulations, had a material impact on the entire petroleum industry, and we adapted and managed our operations by finding materials better suited to comply with these regulations. As such, it is possible that future changes in federal regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results from operations.
We must also obtain and maintain a range of federal, state and local permits for our various logistical needs as well as our planned industrial processes.
The following is a summary of the more significant existing health, safety and environmental laws and regulations to which our operations are subject.
Hazardous Substances and Waste
The United States Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended, referred to as “CERCLA” or the “Superfund” law, and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain defined persons, including current and prior owners or operators of a site where a release of hazardous substances occurred and entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these “responsible persons” may be liable for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies.
In the course of our operations, we occasionally generate materials that are considered “hazardous substances” and, as a result, may incur CERCLA liability for cleanup costs. Also, claims may be filed for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other pollutants. We also generate solid wastes that are subject to the requirements of the United States Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, or “RCRA,” and comparable state statutes.
Although we use operating and disposal practices that are standard in the industry, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been released at properties owned or leased by us now or in the past, or at other locations where these hydrocarbons and wastes were taken for treatment or disposal. Under CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws, we could be required to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater), or to perform remedial activities to prevent future contamination.
Air Emissions
The Clean Air Act, as amended, or “CAA,” and similar state laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain approvals or permits for construction, modification or operation of certain projects or facilities and may require use of emission controls.
Global Warming and Climate Change
Various state governments and regional organizations have enacted, or are considering enacting, new legislation and promulgating new regulations governing or restricting the emission of GHG, including from refineries, re-refineries, other facilities, vehicles and equipment. At the federal level, the EPA has already made findings and issued regulations that require us to establish and report an inventory of greenhouse gas emissions. Legislative and regulatory proposals for restricting GHG emissions or otherwise addressing climate change could require us to incur additional operating costs and could adversely affect demand for the refined oil and other finished products that we sell or the cost of the raw materials and other feedstocks that we purchase. The potential increase in our operating costs could include new or increased costs to obtain permits, operate and maintain our equipment and facilities, install new emission controls on our equipment and facilities, acquire allowances to authorize our greenhouse gas emissions, pay taxes related to our greenhouse gas emissions and administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program.
Additionally, the development of a federal renewable energy standard, or the development of additional or more stringent renewable energy standards at the state level could reduce the demand for refined oil and other of our finished products, thereby adversely impacting our earnings, cash flows and financial position. A cap-and-trade program generally would cap overall greenhouse gas emissions on an economy-wide basis and require major sources of greenhouse gas emissions or major fuel producers to acquire and surrender emission allowances. A federal cap and trade program or expanded use of cap and trade programs at the state level could impose direct costs on us through the purchase of allowances and could impose indirect costs by incentivizing consumers to shift away from fossil fuels. In addition, federal or state carbon taxes could directly increase our costs of operation and similarly incentivize consumers to shift away from fossil fuels.
In addition, activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at sources of funding for fossil-fuel energy companies, which has resulted in an increasing number of financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities. Ultimately, this may make it more difficult and expensive for us to secure funding. Members of the investment community have also begun to screen companies such as ours for sustainability performance, including practices related to greenhouse gases and climate change, before investing in our securities. Any efforts to improve our sustainability practices in response to these pressures may increase our costs, and we may be forced to implement technologies that are not economically viable in order to improve our sustainability performance and to meet the specific requirements to perform services for certain customers.
These various legislative, regulatory and other activities addressing greenhouse gas emissions could adversely affect our business, including by imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from, our equipment and operations, which could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations. Limitations on greenhouse gas emissions could also adversely affect demand for oil and gas, which could lower the value of our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition and liquidity.
Compliance with GHG laws or taxes could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources.
Environmental Matters
Like other petroleum refiners, we are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. These laws generally provide for control of pollutants released into the environment and require responsible parties to undertake remediation of hazardous waste disposal. These governmental entities may also propose or assess fines or require corrective actions for these asserted violations. Except as disclosed below, we do not anticipate that any such matters currently known to management will have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 
Water Discharges
We operate facilities that are subject to requirements of the United States Clean Water Act, as amended, or “CWA,” and analogous state laws for regulating discharges of pollutants into the waters of the United States and regulating quality standards for surface waters. Among other things, these laws impose restrictions and controls on the discharge of pollutants, including into navigable waters as well as the protection of drinking water sources. Spill prevention, control and counter-measure requirements under the CWA require implementation of measures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a hydrocarbon spill. Other requirements for the prevention of spills are established under the United States Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended, or “OPA”, which amended the CWA and applies to owners and operators of vessels, including barges, offshore platforms and certain onshore facilities. Under OPA, regulated parties are strictly liable for oil spills and must establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to cover liabilities related to an oil spill for which such parties could be statutorily responsible.
Federal Renewable Fuels Standard Program
The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program was created under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which amended the Clean Air Act. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (“EISA”) further amended the CAA by expanding the RFS program. The EPA implements the program in consultation with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Department of Energy. 
The RFS program is a national policy that requires a certain volume of renewable fuel to replace or reduce the quantity of petroleum-based transportation fuel, heating oil or jet fuel. The four renewable fuel categories under the RFS are: (1) biomass-based diesel; (2) cellulosic biofuel; (3) advanced biofuel; and (4) total renewable fuel.
According to the EPA, for a fuel to qualify as a renewable fuel under the RFS program, the EPA must determine that the fuel qualifies under the statute and regulations. Among other requirements, fuels must achieve a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as compared to a 2005 petroleum baseline. The EPA has approved fuel pathways under the RFS program under all four categories of renewable fuel. Advanced pathways already approved include ethanol made from sugarcane; jet fuel made from camelina; cellulosic ethanol made from corn stover; compressed natural gas from municipal wastewater treatment facility digesters; and others.
The EPA continues to review and approve new pathways, including for fuels made with advanced technologies or with new feedstocks. Certain biofuels are similar enough to gasoline or diesel that they do not have to be blended, but can be simply “dropped in” to existing petroleum-based fuels. These drop-in biofuels directly replace petroleum-based fuels and hold particular promise for the future. 
Obligated parties under the RFS program are refiners or importers of gasoline or diesel fuel. Compliance is achieved by blending renewable fuels into transportation fuel, or by obtaining credits (called “Renewable Identification Numbers”, or RINs) to meet an EPA-specified Renewable Volume Obligation (RVO). The EPA calculates and establishes RVOs every year through rulemaking, based on the CAA volume requirements and projections of gasoline and diesel production for the coming year. The standards are converted into a percentage and obligated parties must demonstrate compliance annually.
RINs are generated when a producer makes a gallon of renewable fuel and at the end of the compliance year and RINs can be traded between parties. Obligated parties can buy gallons of renewable fuel with RINs attached and can also buy RINs on the market. Obligated parties can carry over unused RINs between compliance years. They may also carry a compliance deficit into the next year; however, this deficit must be made up the following year. 
We generate RINs through the blending of biofuels and plan to generate additional RINs through our renewal biodiesel operations at the Mobile Refinery. To the degree the Company is unable to blend the required amount of biofuels to satisfy its RINs obligation, RINs must be purchased on the open market to avoid penalties and fines. The Company records its RINs obligation on a net basis in accrued expenses when its RINs liability is greater than the amount of RINs earned and purchased in a given period and in Prepaid and other current assets when the amount of RINs earned and purchased is greater than the RINs liability.
State Environmental Regulations
Our operations involve the storage, handling, transport and disposal of bulk waste materials, some of which contain oil, contaminants and other regulated substances. Various environmental laws and regulations require prevention, and where necessary, cleanup of spills and leaks of such materials and some of our operations must obtain permits that limit the discharge of materials. Failure to comply with such environmental requirements or permits may result in fines and penalties, remediation orders and revocation of permits. Specifically, in Texas, we are subject to rules and regulations promulgated by the Texas Railroad Commission and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, including those designed to protect the environment and monitor compliance with water quality. In Louisiana, we are subject to rules and regulations promulgated by the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources as to environmental and water quality issues, and the Louisiana Public Service Commission as to allocation of intrastate routes and territories for waste water transportation. We believe that we are in compliance with regulations in the states where we conduct business.
Occupational Safety and Health Act
We are subject to the requirements of the United States Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, or “OSHA,” and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of employee health and safety. OSHA’s hazard communication standard 
requires that information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations be maintained and provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens.
Transportation Regulations
We may conduct interstate motor carrier (trucking) operations that are subject to federal regulation by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, or “FMCSA,” a unit within the United States Department of Transportation, or “USDOT.” The FMCSA publishes and enforces comprehensive trucking safety regulations, including rules on commercial driver licensing, controlled substance testing, medical and other qualifications for drivers, equipment maintenance, and drivers’ hours of service, referred to as “HOS.” The agency also performs certain functions relating to such matters as motor carrier registration (licensing), insurance, and extension of credit to motor carriers’ customers. Another unit within USDOT publishes and enforces regulations regarding the transportation of hazardous materials, or “hazmat.” 
In December 2010, the FMCSA launched a program called Compliance, Safety, Accountability, or “CSA,” in an effort to improve commercial truck and bus safety. A component of CSA is the Safety Measurement System, or “SMS,” which analyzes all safety violations recorded by federal and state law enforcement personnel to determine a carrier’s safety performance. The SMS is intended to allow the FMCSA to identify carriers with safety issues and intervene to address those problems. Although our trucking operations currently hold a “Satisfactory” safety rating from FMCSA (the best rating available), the agency has announced a future intention to revise its safety rating system by making greater use of SMS data in lieu of on-site compliance audits of carriers. We cannot predict the effect such a revision may have on our safety rating.
Our intrastate trucking operations are also subject to various state environmental transportation regulations discussed under “Environmental Regulations” above. Federal law also allows states to impose insurance and safety requirements on motor carriers conducting intrastate business within their borders, and to collect a variety of taxes and fees on an apportioned basis reflecting miles actually operated within each state.
HOS regulations establish the maximum number of hours that a commercial truck driver may work. HOS rules, which are intended to reduce the risk of fatigue and fatigue-related crashes and harm to driver health, prohibits a driver from driving if more than eight hours have passed since the driver’s last off-duty or sleeper berth break of at least 30 minutes and limits the use of the restart to once a week, which, on average, results in a maximum work week of 70 hours. 
A new regulation primarily impacting our marine bunker fuel production is known as “IMO 2020”. On January 1, 2020, the International Maritime Organization (the “IM”) implemented a new regulation for a 0.50% global sulphur cap for marine fuels. Under the new global cap, ships that traverse the oceans will be required to use marine fuels with a sulphur content of no more than 0.50%, versus the prior limit of 3.50%, in an effort to reduce the amount of sulphur oxide and decrease pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the global shipping fleet. 
Our Marrero facility produces and sells IMO 2020 compliant bunker fuel.
Inflation and Commodity Price Risk
We have seen increases in costs when comparing to the prior year as well as inflationary and supply chain pressures across our business in areas such as labor, transportation, supplies and overall energy related expenses. We purchase petroleum and petroleum by-products for consolidation and delivery, as well as for our own refining operations. By virtue of constant changes in the market value of petroleum products, we are exposed to fluctuations in both revenues and expenses. We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of crude oil, No. 6 Fuel Oil and refined petroleum products. To reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows, we use commodity derivative instruments, such as futures and options. Our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors.
We primarily use commodity derivative instruments as economic hedges, which are not designated as hedging instruments, and we use fair value and cash flow hedges from time to time. 
Our objectives for holding economic hedges are to (i) manage price volatility in certain feedstock and refined petroleum product inventories and fixed-price purchasing, and (ii) lock in the price of forecasted feedstock, refined petroleum product, and refined petroleum product sales at existing market prices. 
The purchase of our used motor oil feedstock tends to track with natural gas pricing due to the market’s typical practice of substituting used motor oil for natural gas as a fuel source for various industrial processes. On the other hand, the 
prices of the products that may in the future be generated through the re-refining processes that we hope to develop are expected to track with market pricing for marine diesel and vacuum-gas oil. The recent rise in oil prices has increased the spread between the price of used motor oil, feedstock and re-refining end-products.
