 Developing Next Generation Cell and Gene Therapy 
 EB-101 for the Treatment of Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (RDEB) 
 Disease Overview 
 RDEB belongs to a group of genetic skin disorders known more broadly as epidermolysis bullosa (“EB”). Patients with RDEB have a defect in the COL7A1 gene resulting in the inability to produce Type VII collagen, which plays an important role in anchoring the dermal and epidermal layers of the skin. RDEB patients have extremely fragile skin resulting in severe, chronic, blistering, mutilating scarring of the hands and feet, joint contractures, strictures of the esophagus, a high risk of developing aggressive squamous cell carcinomas, infections, and risk premature death.
 The two most common subtypes of RDEB are Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa — Severe (“RDEB-GS”); and Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa — Generalized Other (“RDEB-GO”). The two subtypes differ in the specific genetic mutation type which correlates with defects in Collagen VII formation and results in different phenotypes. Individuals with RDEB-GS produce little or no Collagen VII. They have generalized blistering from birth that results in extensive scarring, sparse hair, and blistering of the mucous membranes. Patients with RDEB-GO produce some functional, albeit abnormal, Collagen VII and therefore have more variable and generally less severe disease manifestation. Nevertheless, as described in natural history studies and in the NEBR registry (Fine, J., 2016), some patients with RDEB-GS and RDEB-GO have persistent blistering, severe systemic complications and are at a higher risk of premature death. As observed in the RDEB Registry, patients with RDER-GS and RDEB-GO have a twenty times and five times, respectively, greater probability of death at the age of 30 years than the general population.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 The incidence and prevalence of RDEB are not well defined. To date, the estimated incidence of 0.2-6.65 per million births and prevalence of 3.5-20.4 per million people have been primarily characterized by limited analyses of clinical databases or registries. Using genetic modeling of pathogenic variants of the COL7A1 gene, we estimate the incidence of RDEB to be 95 per million births in the US, of which 3% are RDEB-GS. Considering the relative mortality rates of RDEB-GS, RDEB-GO, and general population, we estimate a prevalence of RDEB from 700 to 4,000 patients in the US (most likely estimate of 2,500 patients), many of whom could benefit from a treatment such as EB-101. This estimate is similar to the number of RDEB patients registered with DEBRA, an advocacy group in the US devoted to the patient community with EB. 
 From a natural history study conducted by Stanford University in 2017 (Solis, D., et al., 2017), RDEB-GS and RDEB-GO patients have on average eight chronic and recurrent wounds of varying sizes per patient, with the majority of wounds being >20cm2. Chronic wounds are defined as those that stay open for more than 12 weeks. Recurrent wounds partially heal but easily re-blister, with most wounds re-blistering within three weeks of healing. The larger wounds carry the highest burden, including pain, pruritis, and risk of infection. 
 Current Management of RDEB 
 At present, there are no approved treatments available for RDEB in the U.S or Europe. The management of RDEB currently consists of supportive wound care to limit contamination/infection and reduce mechanical forces that produce new blisters. Wound care usually includes treatment of new blisters by lancing and draining. Wounds are then dressed with a non-adherent material, covered with padding for stability and protection, and secured with an elastic wrap for integrity.
 Individuals with RDEB have increased caloric and protein needs due to the increased energy utilized in wound healing, while oral intake is limited by oral and esophageal involvement. Infants and children with RDEB may require nutritional support, including a gastrostomy feeding tube. Anemia is typically treated with iron supplements and transfusions as needed. 
 We estimate that the annual cost of symptom supportive care for a RDEB patient is in the range of approximately $20,000 to $400,000 per year. 
 Surveillance is important for individuals with RDEB. Biopsies of abnormal-appearing wounds that do not heal may be recommended in some types of RDEB due to predisposition to squamous cell carcinoma. Screening for deficiencies of iron, zinc, vitamin D, selenium, and carnitine is typically recommended after the first year of life. Routine echocardiograms are recommended to identify dilated cardiomyopathy, and bone mineral density studies are recommended to identify osteoporosis. It is also typically recommended to avoid activities and bandages (including all adhesives) that may traumatize the skin.
 Program Status 
 EB-101 is an autologous, gene-corrected cell therapy in which the normal COL7A1 gene is inserted into a patient’s own skin cells (keratinocytes) and transplanted back to the patient to restore normal Type VII collagen expression and skin function. From preliminary clinical data and expert input, we expect EB-101 to be a potential treatment choice for most wounds, and currently the only product candidate being evaluated as a treatment for larger wounds. EB-101 has been granted both RMAT and Breakthrough designations, FDA and EU Orphan Drug designations and FDA Rare Pediatric Disease designation. 
 Results from a completed Phase I/​II study (Phase I/II gene transfer for recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (NCT01263379)) that enrolled 7 patients with chronic RDEB wounds at Stanford University showed that EB-101 was well-tolerated and resulted in significant and durable wound healing (Siprashvili, Z., et al., 2016). The Phase I/​II study showed significant and durable healing of large chronic wounds, with up to five years of follow-up. There have been no reported serious adverse events observed to date. Continuous Type VII collagen expression was observed for more than two years post treatment. There has been no detection of replication competent retrovirus (RCR) up to four years. 
 The Company expects to initiate a pivotal clinical trial evaluating the potential of EB-101 for the treatment of RDEB in the middle of 2019. The VITAL™ Study will be a multicenter, randomized, Phase III clinical trial assessing 10-15 patients treated with EB-101. The primary endpoint of the study will

 be the proportion of EB-101 treated wounds with >50% healing at three months, compared with untreated wound site on the same patient. Secondary endpoints will include patient reported outcomes such as pain and itch and investigator global assessment of wounds. 
 ABO-102 and ABO-101 for the treatment of Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) III (Sanfilippo syndrome) 
 Disease Overview 
 MPS III (Sanfilippo syndrome) is a group of four inherited lysosomal storage diseases, described as type A, B, C or D, which cause enzyme deficiencies that result in the abnormal accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (sugars) in body tissues. The incidence of MPS III (all four types combined) is estimated to be 1 in 70,000 births. 
 Mucopolysaccharides are long chains of sugar molecules used in the building of connective tissues in the body. Lysosomes are responsible for a continuous process of replacing used materials and breaking them down for disposal. Children with MPS IIIA are missing a lysosomal enzyme that is essential in breaking down used mucopolysaccharides, specifically heparan sulfate (“HS”). The partially broken down heparan sulfate remains stored in cells in the body causing progressive lysosomal and cell damage and eventually cell death. Babies may show little sign of the disease, but as more cells become damaged, symptoms start to appear within the first few years of life. 
 In MPS III, the predominant glycosaminoglycan accumulation occurs in the brain and spinal cord, resulting in cognitive decline, motor dysfunction, and eventual death. Most patients with the rapidly progressing form of MPS III never reach a cognitive function above that of an unaffected 3-year-old child. Accumulation also occurs in other organs, leading to liver enlargement and soft tissue coarsening. To date, there is no cure for MPS III and treatments are largely supportive. 
 Program Status 
 Abeona is developing next-generation AAV-based gene therapies for MPS IIIA and MPS IIIB (Sanfilippo syndrome Type A and Sanfilippo syndrome Type B), ABO-102 and ABO-101, respectively, which involve a one-time intravenous administration that delivers a normal copy of the defective gene to cells of the central nervous system (“CNS”) with the aim of reversing the effects of the genetic errors that cause the disease. Both viral constructs utilize the neurotropism of the serotype AAV9 to cross the blood brain barrier (“BBB”) and deliver the functional copy of the gene to the CNS.
ABO-102 for MPS IIIA
 Preclinical in vivo efficacy studies in animals with MPS IIIA showed that a single dose of ABO-102 significantly restored normal cell and organ function, corrected neurological deficits, increased neuromuscular control, and increased the lifespan by more than 100% one year after treatment compared with untreated control animals. These results are consistent with studies from several laboratories suggesting AAV treatment could potentially benefit patients with MPS III. In addition, safety studies conducted in animal models of MPS IIIA have demonstrated that delivery of ABO-102 is well tolerated with minimal side effects. ABO-102 was granted Fast Track and RMAT designations by the FDA, FDA and EU Orphan Drug designations and FDA Rare Pediatric Disease designation. 
 On December 6, 2018, we reported updated clinical data from the ongoing Phase I/II gene transfer clinical trial of scAAV9.U1a.hSGSH for Mucopolysaccharidosis IIIA (NCT02716246), our investigational gene therapy for the treatment of MPS IIIA. In the trial, subjects received a single intravenous injection of ABO-102 to facilitate systemic delivery, including to the CNS, of a corrective copy of the gene associated with onset and progression of MPS IIIA. Subjects were evaluated at multiple time points post-injection for safety assessments and signals of biopotency and clinical activity. The results showed a robust and durable reduction of heparan sulfate levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (“CSF”), denoting transgene expression in the CNS, and a durable reduction of liver volume. Effects were notable within 30 days post ABO-102 administration and remained stable with up to 2+ years of follow-up. No treatment related serious adverse events (“SAEs”) have been reported to date.

  ABO-101 for MPSIIIB
 In the ABO-101 program for MPS IIIB, subjects in our ongoing clinical study (Phase I/II gene transfer clinical trial of rAAV9.CMV.hNAGLU for Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) IIIB (NCT03315182)) receive a single, intravenous infusion of ABO-101, which uses an AAV vector to introduce the functional NAGLU gene to treat patients with MPS IIIB disease. Subjects will be evaluated at multiple time points post-injection for safety assessments and efficacy parameters. The clinical program is supported by a Natural History Study which included potential efficacy assessments consisting of neurocognitive evaluations, biochemical assays and MRI data generated over one year of follow-up assessments. 
 Preclinical in vivo efficacy studies in mice with MPS IIIB showed that a single dose of ABO-101 significantly restored normal cell and organ function, corrected neurological deficits, increased neuromuscular control, and normalized lifespan compared with untreated control animals. In addition, safety studies conducted in MPS IIIB and wildtype mice and in non-human primates have demonstrated that systemic delivery of ABO-101 is well tolerated with minimal side effects. 
 The first patient in the Phase I/​II clinical trial for ABO-101 (“AAV-NAGLU”) was enrolled in 2017 at Nationwide Children’s Hospital (“NCH”) in Columbus, Ohio. Preliminary results observed in the initial U.S. trial enrollment to date demonstrate a clinically relevant biomarker response and a favorable safety profile. A second patient was enrolled in this study in January 2019, also at NCH. 
 In September 2018, we received authorization to move forward with a Phase I/​II clinical trial in Spain. The clinical study was approved by the Agencia Espanola de Medicamentos y Productos Sanitarios and is being conducted at Hospital Clinico Universitario of Santiago de Compostela, Spain. This will be our second clinical trial conducted in Europe, alongside the ongoing Phase I/​II clinical trial for patients with MPS IIIA (Sanfilippo syndrome type A). Abeona first initiated this trial in the United States. We have plans to activate additional clinical sites in the U.S., and abroad to facilitate patient enrollment. 
 Preclinical Programs 
 ABO-202 for the treatment of CLN1 disease, also known as infantile Batten disease (or Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis) (“NCL”) 
 Disease Overview 
 CLN1 disease (also known as infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis or Batten disease type 1) is a severe neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disease, currently with no approved treatment. It is caused by mutations in the CLN1 gene, encoding the soluble lysosomal enzyme palmitoyl-protein thioesterase-1 (“PPT1”). 

 6

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 In the classic form, rapidly progressive clinical features appear between the ages of 6 and 24 months, including speech and motor deterioration, refractory epilepsy, ataxia, myoclonus, and visual loss. By five years of age, CLN1 disease patients with the classic infantile form are typically poorly responsive and are no longer communicative. Death follows a few years after disease onset. Patients with low level of residual PPT1 activity develop a later onset form of CLN1 disease characterized by similar symptoms, but with slower progression. Patients with later onset of CLN1 generally succumb to the disease in the second decade. 
 There is no approved treatment for patients with CLN1 and the current care option is supportive and palliative. Gene therapy is proposed as a potential treatment for CLN1. 
 ABO-202 is designed to replace the faulty gene in affected cells and restore functionality of the protein. This therapy’s viral construct, utilizing the AAV9 serotype, is able to cross the blood brain barrier (“BBB”) to deliver the CLN1 gene to the CNS. The AAV9 trans-BBB neurotropism is advantageous because of involvement of the CNS in disease progression. This potential therapy is designed to allow the transformed cells to properly express the functional protein, and target PPT1 protein to the correct site of action, which in this case is the lysosomal matrix. The corrected enzyme can be secreted by transduced CNS cells and be taken up by neighboring cells via mannose 6-phosphate-mediated endocytosis and trafficked to the lysosome, cross-correcting substrate storing cells. This enables a potential therapeutic effect that goes beyond the initial transduction efficiency of the drug product. This in vivo gene therapy offers the possibility of a one-time treatment by inserting a healthy copy of the CLN1 gene and allowing the body to start making the missing enzyme, therefore slowing or halting CLN1 disease progression. 
 Program Status 
 On February 12, 2018, we announced that the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation (“ODD”) to our ABO-202 program. We have also secured an exclusive, worldwide license for AAV9 for treatment of CLN1. This therapeutic approach is a scAAV9 vector with codon-optimized CLN1 transgene (“AAV-CLN1”), an AAV-based gene therapy for the treatment of infantile Batten disease. 
 An investigational new drug (“IND”) application is expected to be filed in this first quarter of 2019, with the clinical study initiation expected later in 2019. 
 The preclinical data for ABO-202 were presented at our Research & Development Day on December 6, 2018 and a slightly updated version of the presentation was delivered at the WORLD Congress of Lysosomal Storage Diseases in Orlando, FL on February 6, 2019. Key findings included: 
 •

 CLN1 mice recapitulate the major features of the human disease manifestations; 
 ​
 •

 The study data showed that a single intrathecal (“IT”) injection of self-complementary adeno-associated virus 9 (scAAV9) encoding the human CLN1 gene administered to CLN1 mice at 1 week and 1 month (pre-symptomatic) and 12 weeks significantly increased their survival, improved behavior and reduced motor deficits; higher IT doses further improved longevity and function, suggesting that methods increasing CNS exposure may be beneficial and provided some survival and behavioral benefit to symptomatic CLN1 mice; 
 ​
 •

 A combination delivery approach administering ABO-202 by both intravenous and intrathecal routes to symptomatic animals (at 20 weeks) increased survival efficacy by >50% over intrathecal alone, and thus indicate a potential for treatment of patients with more advanced disease manifestations; and 
 ​
 •

 Consistent with other AAV studies for lysosomal storage disease, early intervention (i.e., treatment at a younger age) yielded better results compared with animals treated later, which required higher doses for the same benefit.

 ABO-201 for the treatment of CLN3 disease, also known as juvenile Batten disease (or Juvenile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinoses) (“CLN3 Disease”) 
 Disease Overview and Program Status 
 CLN3 disease is a rare, fatal, autosomal recessive (inherited) disorder of the nervous system that typically begins between 4 and 8 years of age. Often the first noticeable sign of CLN3 disease is vision

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 impairment, which tends to progress rapidly and eventually result in blindness. As the disease progresses, children experience loss of previously acquired skills (developmental regression). This regression usually begins with the loss of the ability to speak in complete sentences. Children then lose motor skills, such as the ability to walk or sit. They also develop movement abnormalities that include rigidity or stiffness, slow or diminished movements (hypokinesia), and stooped posture. Beginning in mid- to late childhood, affected children may have recurrent seizures (epilepsy), heart problems, behavioral problems, and difficulty sleeping. Normal life expectancy is greatly reduced. Most people with juvenile Batten disease live into their twenties or thirties. As of December 31, 2018, no specific treatment is known that can halt or reverse the symptoms of CLN3 disease. 
 CLN3 disease is the most common form of a group of disorders known as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (“NCLs”). Collectively, all forms of NCL affect an estimated 2 to 4 in 100,000 live births in the United States. NCLs are more common in Finland, where approximately 1 in 12,500 individuals are affected, as well as Sweden, other parts of northern Europe, and Newfoundland, Canada. 
 CLN3 disease is the most common form of Batten disease. Mutations associated with CLN3 disrupt the function of cellular structures called lysosomes. Lysosomes are compartments in the cell that normally digest and recycle different types of molecules. Lysosome malfunction leads to a buildup of fatty substances called lipopigments and proteins within these cell structures. These accumulations occur in cells throughout the body, but neurons in the brain seem to be particularly vulnerable to damage. The progressive functional impairment and eventual death of cells, especially in the brain, leads to vision loss, seizures, and intellectual decline in children with CLN3 disease. 
 ABO-201 (scAAV9.CLN3) is being developed as an AAV9-based gene therapy that has shown preclinical efficacy following delivery of a normal copy of the CLN3 gene to a mouse model of CLN3 disease. Preclinical studies have previously demonstrated reduced lysosomal storage and decreased astrocyte/microglia activation in the CNS as well as improved motor function. 
 Next-Generation Gene Therapy Treatments anchored in AIM™ Vector Platform 
 In 2016, we licensed a library of first-generation novel AAV capsids from the University of North Carolina. In partnership with academic institutions, our scientific research teams have identified vectors within the AIM™ capsid library showing strong potential to successfully target and reach the central nervous system, lung, skin, muscle, liver and other tissues. Based on continuing research being conducted by Abeona and our research partners, we see demonstrated improvements in gene delivery to specific tissues compared to currently available AAV technology. Viral vectors, which have shown increased tissue tropisms with potential for delivering treatment of cystic fibrosis and eye disorders, are supporting Abeona product programs in cystic fibrosis and retinal disorders. AIM™ vectors also have the potential for redosing previously treated AAV subjects in various disease states.
 ABO 401 for the Treatment of Cystic Fibrosis 
 Disease Overview 
 Cystic Fibrosis (“CF”) is a progressive, genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (“CFTR”) gene. Malfunction of this gene affects cells that produce mucus, sweat and digestive juices. In unaffected individuals, these secreted fluids are normally thin and slippery, but in cystic fibrosis, a defective gene causes the secretions to become sticky and thick. Instead of acting as a lubricant, the secretions plug up tubes, ducts and passageways, especially in the lungs and pancreas, and cause repeated lung infections and difficulty breathing, and impaired pancreas function and digestive abnormalities. 
 Cystic fibrosis affects at least 30,000 people in the United States; between 900 and 1,000 new cases are diagnosed every year. 
 Program Status 
 The preclinical ABO-401 program has demonstrated vector delivery to the lungs of unaffected mice. Study results also demonstrate CFTR transgene expression that has corrected the underlying chloride current deficit in CF animals. Pre-clinical data suggest ABO-401, based on the AAV204 vector, efficiently

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 targets lung cells and that ABO-401 corrects the underlying cystic fibrosis chloride channel deficit, regardless of underlying mutations of the CF transmembrane conductance regulators, including the most common CF mutation, delta-F508. 
 ABO-50X for the treatment of genetic eye disorders 
 Program Overview 
 Eighty percent of genetic eye disorders occur in the photoreceptors and a correction of mutations in the retina has been accomplished by several groups using AAV gene therapy delivered through subretinal injection. Intravitreal delivery of small volume gene therapies constitutes an attractive alternative to deliver gene therapy to the retina in an out-patient setting. 
Program Status 
 We reported non-human primate data suggesting that next-generation AIM™ AAV vectors can be used to efficiently target the retinal epithelium after intravitreal injection, creating the potential for new pipeline candidates that can address multiple eye disorders. 
 Also presented were data showing that certain AIM™ capsids demonstrated high tropisms for central nervous system tissue can evade neutralizing antibodies against naturally occurring AAV serotype, and potentially enable redosing in patients that have previously received an AAV injection. 
 Polymer Hydrogel Technology (PHT™) 
 MuGard® (mucoadhesive oral wound rinse) for mucositis, stomatitis, aphthous ulcers, and traumatic ulcers
 MuGard is our legacy marketed product for the management of oral mucositis, a frequent side-effect of cancer therapy for which there is no other established treatment. MuGard, a proprietary nanopolymer formulation, received marketing clearance from the FDA in the U.S. as well as the applicable regulatory authorities in Europe, China, Australia, New Zealand and Korea. We launched MuGard in the U.S. in 2010 and licensed MuGard for commercialization in the U.S. to AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AMAG) in 2013. We licensed MuGard to RHEI Pharmaceuticals, N.V. for China and other Southeast Asian countries in 2010; Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. for South Korea in 2014; and Norgine B.V. for the European Union, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Lichtenstein, Australia and New Zealand in 2014. 
 Establishing Leadership Position in Commercial-Scale Gene and Cell-Therapy Manufacturing 
 We have established a cGMP manufacturing facility to increase quality control, enhance supply chain control, increase supply capacity and manufacturing efficiency for clinical trials related to our product candidates and ensure commercial demand is met in the event our therapies receive marketing approval. Our facility is led by a team of highly-skilled production, process/assay development and QA/QC scientists with expertise in cell and gene therapy, particularly in cell culture, formulation, upstream, downstream and purification manufacturing. We have completed the first 6,000 square feet stage of our planned 26,000 square feet manufacturing build-out of a state-of-the-art process cGMP production facility for the manufacturing of cell and gene therapies at our Cleveland, Ohio location. The facility is designed to initially manufacture clinical drug product with later intent of manufacturing commercial grade cGMP drug product. The second stage of the build-out is underway and includes an 8,000 square feet state-of-the-art lab space to support our expanding quality control and process/assay development teams. 
 Additionally, we are working to advance our in-house manufacturing capabilities for our LZRSE COL7A1 retroviral autologous cell replacement therapy (EB-101) for the treatment of RDEB. The product is manufactured as a multilayer cellular sheet containing corrected keratinocytes that is fastened to a petrolatum gauze backing with surgical hemoclips. It is applied over wound areas, where they are expected to produce keratinocytes with normal Type VII collagen, providing wound coverage and allowing for wound healing.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 We are developing manufacturing capabilities that use a chemical method we refer to as transfection for our AAV-based vector product candidates. We insert many copies of DNA plasmids encoding the specific therapeutic gene sequence, or transgene, into human embryonic kidney cells (HEK) 293 using adherent and suspension vector production technologies. During an incubation period following transfection, each cell produces vectors through biosynthesis using the natural machinery available within the cell. At the end of the incubation period, the newly generated vectors are collected from the cells that have been broken apart or, alternatively, from the cell culture medium. We continue to maintain focus on cGMP compliance and ensuring adequate supply to support our future clinical activity. 
 We have established and maintained strong and collaborative contract manufacturing relationships with third-party companies specializing in the manufacturing of gene therapy material to complement our process and assay development needs. 
 We have made significant investments in developing optimized manufacturing processes and believe that our processes and methods provide a comprehensive manufacturing process developed to date for EB-101 and AAV-based vector therapies, including: 
 •

 sufficient scale to support commercial manufacturing requirements for our product candidates; 
 ​
 •

 processes related to biopsy, cell collection, storage and transportation as part of manufacturing for EB-101; 
 ​
 •

 processes related to product release testing for EB-101; 
 ​
 •

 stable manufactured AAV vectors with sufficient longevity so that a small number of initial batches will likely provide adequate supply; 
 ​
 •

 proprietary AAV vector manufacturing processes and techniques that produce a highly purified product candidate; 
 ​
 •

 multiple assays to accurately characterize our process and the AAV vectors we produce; 
 ​
 •

 a series of purification processes, which may be adapted and customized for multiple different AAV capsids, with a goal of higher concentrations of active vectors, and that are essentially free of empty capsids; and 
 ​
 •

 establishing transportation and packaging processes and materials for finished EB-101 product. 
 ​
 We believe these improvements, and our continued investment in our manufacturing platform, will enable us to develop best-in-class, next-generation gene therapy products. We are working towards receiving FDA cGMP validation of our facility in Cleveland to produce commercial supply of EB-101.

We additionally may rely on regulatory protection afforded through data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions where available. 
 Our success may depend in part on our ability to: obtain and maintain patent and other protections for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and intellectual property rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, having made, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable licenses, patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. In some cases, these rights may need to be enforced by third-party licensors. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of manufacturing the same. 
 We are actively seeking U.S. and international patent protection for a variety of technologies, including the following: research tools and methods, methods for transferring genetic material into cells, AAV-based biological products, methods of designing novel AAV constructs, methods for treating diseases of interest and methods for manufacturing our products. We also intend to seek patent protection or rely upon trade secret rights to protect other technologies that may be used to discover and validate targets and that may be used to identify and develop novel biological products. We seek protection, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements. We are a party to various license agreements that give us rights to use specific technologies in our research and development, and future commercialization.

REGENXBIO will also receive low double-digit royalties on net sales of products incorporating the licensed intellectual property. 
 We continue to explore strategies to support patent grant extensions for all of our licensed portfolios. 
 U.S. Biologic Products Development Process 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates biologic products including gene therapy products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”), and 

 11

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 regulations implementing these laws. The FDCA, PHSA and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, advertising and promotion of biologic products. Applications to the FDA are required before conducting human clinical testing of biologic products. Additionally, each clinical trial protocol for a gene therapy product candidate is reviewed by the FDA and, in limited instances NIH, through its Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (“RAC”). FDA approval also must be obtained before marketing of biologic products. 
 Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (“CBER”) regulates gene therapy products. Within CBER, the review of gene therapy and related products is consolidated in the Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies (“OCTGT”) and the FDA has established the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee (“CTGTAC”), a panel of medical and scientific experts and consumer representatives, to advise CBER on its reviews. CBER works closely with NIH and the RAC, which makes recommendations to NIH on gene therapy issues and engages in a public discussion of scientific, safety, ethical and societal issues related to proposed and ongoing gene therapy protocols. The FDA has issued a growing body of guidance documents on chemistry, manufacturing and control (“CMC”), clinical investigations and other areas of gene therapy development, all of which are intended to facilitate the industry’s development of gene therapy products. 
 The process required by the FDA before a biologic product candidate may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
 •

 completion of preclinical laboratory tests and in vivo studies in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”) regulations and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations; 
 ​
 •

 submission to the FDA of an application for an Investigational New Drug exemption (“IND”), which allows human clinical trials to begin unless the FDA objects within 30 days; 
 ​
 •

 approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”), reviewing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated; 
 ​
 •

 performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) regulations, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended use; 
 ​
 •

 preparation and submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application (“BLA”), for marketing approval that includes substantial evidence of safety, purity and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials; 
 ​
 •

 satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biologic product candidate is produced to assess compliance with cGMP and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biologic product candidate’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity; 
 ​
 •

 potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and 
 ​
 •

 payment of user fees and the FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA. BLA or new drug application (“NDA”), application fees for products designated as orphan drugs by the FDA are waived. 
 ​
 Before testing any biologic product candidate on humans, including a gene therapy product candidate, the product candidate must undergo preclinical testing. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as in vivo studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. 

 12

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 If a gene therapy trial is conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving NIH funding for recombinant DNA research, prior to the submission of an IND to the FDA, a protocol and related documents must be submitted to, and the study registered with, the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities (“OBA”), pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules (“NIH Guidelines”). Compliance with the NIH Guidelines is mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving NIH funds for research involving recombinant DNA. However, many companies and other institutions, not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines, voluntarily follow them. NIH is responsible for convening the RAC that discusses protocols that raise novel or particularly important scientific, safety or ethical considerations at one of its quarterly public meetings. The OBA will notify the FDA of the RAC’s decision regarding the necessity for full public review of a gene therapy protocol. RAC proceedings and reports are posted to the OBA website and may be accessed by the public. 
 The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. With gene therapy protocols, if the FDA allows the IND to proceed, but the RAC decides that full public review of the protocol is warranted, the FDA will request at the completion of its IND review that sponsors delay initiation of the protocol until after completion of the RAC review process. The FDA also may impose clinical holds on a biologic product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. 
 Human clinical trials under an IND 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the biologic product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, which generally are physicians not employed by, or under the control of, the trial sponsor. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. 
 Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers items such as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject, or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Clinical trials involving recombinant DNA also must be reviewed by an institutional biosafety committee (“IBC”), a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research that utilizes recombinant DNA at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment. 
 Human clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
 •

 Phase I:   The biologic product candidate initially is introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early understanding of its effectiveness. In the case of some product candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product candidate may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 
 ​

​
  13

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 •

 Phase II:   The biologic product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. 
 ​
 •

 Phase III:   The biologic product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to generate sufficient data to statistically confirm the efficacy and safety of the product for approval. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 
 ​
 Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase IV clinical trials, may be conducted after initial approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. 
 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. 
 Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, NIH and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events; any findings from other trials, in vivo laboratory tests or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects; or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. 
 The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biologic product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 Additional regulation for gene therapy clinical trials 
 In addition to the regulations discussed above, there are a number of additional standards that apply to clinical trials involving the use of gene therapy. The FDA has issued various guidance documents regarding gene therapies, which outline additional factors that the FDA will consider at each of the above stages of development and relate to, among other things: the proper preclinical assessment of gene therapies; the CMC information that should be included in an IND application; the proper design of tests to measure product efficacy in support of an IND or BLA application; and measures to observe delayed adverse effects in subjects who have been exposed to investigational gene therapies when the risk of such effects is high. Further, the FDA usually recommends that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by 10 years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire. 
 NIH and the FDA have a publicly accessible database, the Genetic Modification Clinical Research Information System, which includes information on gene therapy trials and serves as an electronic tool to facilitate the reporting and analysis of adverse events on these trials. 
 Compliance with cGMP requirements 
 Manufacturers of biologics must comply with applicable cGMP regulations. Manufacturers and others involved in the manufacture and distribution of such products also must register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Both domestic and foreign manufacturing establishments must register and provide additional information to the FDA upon their initial participation in the manufacturing process. Establishments may be subject to periodic, unannounced inspections by government authorities to ensure compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Discovery of problems may result in a 

 14

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 government entity placing restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, and may extend to requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities comply with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specification. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional preclinical studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biologic product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product candidate in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents or of causing other adverse events with the use of biologic products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other requirements, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biologic product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biologic product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 U.S. review and approval processes 
 The results of the preclinical tests and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s CMC and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. 
 For gene therapies, selecting patients with applicable genetic defects is a necessary condition to effective treatment. For the therapies we are currently developing, we believe that diagnoses based on symptoms, in conjunction with existing genetic tests developed and administered by laboratories certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (“CLIA”), are sufficient to select appropriate patients and will be permitted by the FDA. For future therapies, however, it may be necessary to use FDA-cleared or FDA-approved diagnostic tests to select patients or to assure the safe and effective use of therapies in appropriate patients. The FDA refers to such tests as in vitro companion diagnostic devices. On July 31, 2014, the FDA announced the publication of a final guidance document describing the agency’s current thinking about the development and regulation of in vitro companion diagnostic devices. The final guidance articulates a policy position that, when safe and effective use of a therapeutic product depends on a diagnostic device, the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic device at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. The final guidance allows for two exceptions to the general rule of concurrent drug/device approval, namely, when the therapeutic product is intended to treat serious and life-threatening conditions for which no alternative exists, and when a serious safety issue arises for an already approved therapeutic agent, and no FDA-cleared or FDA-approved companion diagnostic test is yet available. At this point, it is unclear how the FDA will apply this policy to our future gene therapy candidates, or even to our current products. Should the FDA deem genetic tests used for selecting appropriate patients for our therapies to be in vitro companion diagnostics requiring FDA clearance or approval, we may face significant delays or obstacles in obtaining approval for a BLA. 
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biologic product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product candidate is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biologic product candidate for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. 
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDA’s fee schedule, effective for fiscal year 2019, the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such as a BLA, is $2,588,478. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee of $309,915. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for product candidates designated as orphan drugs, unless the product candidate also includes a non-orphan indication.

 15

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 The FDA reviews a BLA within 60 days of submission to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In that event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth, substantive review of the BLA. 
 The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product candidate is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, has an acceptable purity profile and whether the product candidate is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product candidate’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biologic products or biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) is necessary to assure the safe use of the product candidate. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required. 
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product candidate is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product candidate unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities comply with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product candidate within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements. 
 On the basis of the BLA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information for the FDA to reconsider the application. If those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. 
 If a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase IV clinical trials, designed to further assess a biologic product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. 
 The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review of BLAs under the PDUFA. One such goal is to review 90% of standard BLAs in 10 months after the FDA accepts the BLA for filing, and 90% of priority BLAs in six months, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date. 
 Orphan drug designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a biologic product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing 

 16

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 and making a biologic product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
 If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, meaning that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biologic product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or if the party holding the exclusivity fails to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the same indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan medicinal product status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, benefits. 
 Expedited development and review programs 
 The FDA is authorized to expedite the review of BLAs in several ways. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a biologic product candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a Fast Track product concurrent with or after the filing of the IND. Biologic products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to have greater interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track BLA before the application is complete, a process known as rolling review. 
 Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval. 
 •

  Breakthrough therapy designation:   To qualify for the breakthrough therapy program, product candidates must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence must indicate that such product candidates may demonstrate substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. The FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product candidate receives: intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program; intensive involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative and cross-disciplinary review; and rolling review. 
 ​
 •

  Priority review:   A product candidate is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious condition and, if approved, it would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious condition compared to marketed products. The FDA aims to complete its review of priority review applications within six months as opposed to 10 months for standard review. 
 ​
 •

  Accelerated approval:   Drug or biologic products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval. Accelerated approval means that a product candidate may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity and prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials. 
 ​

​
  17

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Fast Track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. 
 Finally, with passage of the 21st Century Cures Act (the “Cures Act”) in December 2016, Congress authorized the FDA to accelerate review and approval of products designated as regenerative advanced therapies. A product is eligible for this designation if it is a regenerative medicine therapy (which may include a cell therapy) that is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of a regenerative advanced therapy designation include early interactions with the FDA to expedite development and review, benefits available to breakthrough therapies, potential eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints. 
 Post-approval requirements 
 Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biologic products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP requirements. Manufacturers are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biologic products include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse events, reporting updated safety and efficacy information and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. If the product is subject to official lot release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA, together with a release protocol, showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency and effectiveness of biologic products. 
 A sponsor also must comply with the FDA’s advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. 
 Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal actions and adverse publicity. These actions could include refusal to approve pending applications or supplemental applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, suspension or termination of clinical trial by an IRB, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines or other monetary penalties, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications to healthcare professionals or patients, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits or other civil or criminal penalties.
 U.S. patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of product candidates, some of a sponsor’s U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period generally is one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time 

 18

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved biologic product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The United State Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”), in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. 
 Pediatric exclusivity 
 Pediatric exclusivity is a type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States that, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if a BLA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to, and accepted by, the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection that cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot accept or approve a biosimilar application. 
 Biosimilars and exclusivity 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (“PPACA”), created an abbreviated approval pathway for biologic products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biologic product, referred to as biosimilars. For the FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must find that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and proposed biosimilar product. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. 
 A reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product. An application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following approval of the reference product, and it may not be approved until 12 years thereafter. These exclusivity provisions only apply to biosimilars — companies that rely on their own data and file a full BLA may be approved earlier than 12 years. 
 The 21st Century Cures Act 
 On December 13, 2016, President Obama signed the Cures Act into law. The Cures Act is designed to modernize and personalize healthcare, spur innovation and research and streamline the discovery and development of new therapies through increased federal funding of particular programs. It authorizes increasing funding for the FDA to spend on innovation projects. The new law also amends the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize and expand funding for the NIH. The Cures Act establishes the NIH Innovation Fund to pay for the cost of development and implementation of a strategic plan, early stage investigators and research. It also charges NIH with leading and coordinating expanded pediatric research. Further, the Cures Act directs the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to expand surveillance of neurological diseases. 
 With amendments to the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”), Title III of the Cures Act seeks to accelerate the discovery, development and delivery of new medicines and medical technologies. To that end, and among other provisions, the Cures Act reauthorizes for four years the priority review voucher program for certain drugs intended to treat rare pediatric diseases; creates a new priority review voucher program for drug applications determined to be material threat medical countermeasure applications; revises the FDCA to streamline review of combination product applications; requires the FDA to evaluate the potential use of “real world evidence” to help support approval of new indications for approved drugs; provides a new “limited population” approval pathway for antibiotic and antifungal drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections; and authorizes the FDA to designate a drug as a “regenerative advanced therapy,” thereby making it eligible for certain expedited review and approval designations.

 Government regulation outside of the United States 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, sponsors are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of biologic products. Because biologically-sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries. 
 Whether or not a sponsor obtains FDA approval for a product, a sponsor must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application, much like the IND, prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a request for a Clinical Trial Authorization (“CTA”) must be submitted to the competent regulatory authorities and the competent Ethics Committees in the European Union Member States in which the clinical trial takes place, much like the FDA and the IRB, respectively. Once the CTA request is approved in accordance with the European Union and the European Union Member State’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. 
 The requirements and processes governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCPs and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 Failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, fines, suspension, variation or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 
 European Union regulation and exclusivity 
 To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational biologic product under European Union regulatory systems, applicants must submit a marketing authorization application (“MAA”). The grant of marketing authorization in the European Union for products containing viable human tissues or cells such as gene therapy medicinal products is governed by Regulation 1394/2007/EC on advanced therapy medicinal products, read in combination with Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, commonly known as the Community code on medicinal products. Regulation 1394/2007/EC lays down specific rules concerning the authorization, supervision and pharmacovigilance of gene therapy medicinal products, somatic cell therapy medicinal products and tissue engineered products. Manufacturers of advanced therapy medicinal products must demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of their products to the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) which provides an opinion regarding the application for marketing authorization. The European Commission grants or refuses marketing authorization in light of the opinion delivered by EMA. 
 Innovative medicinal products are authorized in the European Union based on a full marketing authorization application (as opposed to an application for marketing authorization that relies on data in the marketing authorization dossier for another, previously approved medicinal product). Applications for marketing authorization for innovative medicinal products must contain the results of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials conducted with the medicinal product for which marketing authorization is sought. Innovative medicinal products for which marketing authorization is granted are entitled to eight years of data exclusivity. During this period, applicants for approval of generics or biosimilars of these innovative products cannot rely on data contained in the marketing authorization dossier submitted for the innovative medicinal product to support their application. Innovative medicinal products for which marketing authorization is granted are also entitled to 10 years of market exclusivity. During these 10 years of market exclusivity, no generic or biosimilar medicinal product may be placed on the European Union market even if a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization can be submitted to the competent regulatory authorities in the European Union Member States. The overall 10-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity and the innovator is able

 to gain the period of data exclusivity, another company, nevertheless, could also market another competing medicinal product for the same therapeutic indication if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials. 
 Products receiving orphan designation in the European Union can receive 10 years of market exclusivity. During this 10-year period, the competent authorities of the European Union Member States and European Commission may not accept applications or grant marketing authorization for other similar medicinal product for the same orphan indication. There are, however, three exceptions to this principle. Marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product for the same orphan indication if: 
 •

 The second applicant can establish in its application that its medicinal product, although similar to the orphan medicinal product already authorized, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; 
 ​
 •

 The holder of the marketing authorization for the original orphan medicinal product consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or 
 ​
 •

 The holder of the marketing authorization for the original orphan medicinal product cannot supply sufficient quantities of orphan medicinal product. 
 ​
 An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the European Union for the conduct of pediatric trials. The 10-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation; for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. 
 The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the European Union are similar, in principle, to those in the United States. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers. The application for orphan medicinal product designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. Orphan medicinal product designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
 In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 (the “Clinical Trials Regulation”), which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC (the “Clinical Trials Directive”). The new Clinical Trials Regulation is still pending. Until the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable, all clinical trials performed in the European Union are required to be conducted in accordance with the Clinical Trials Directive, which will be repealed on the day of entry into application of the Clinical Trial Regulation. It will however still apply three years from that day to (i) clinical trials applications submitted before the entry into application and (ii) clinical trials applications submitted within one year after the entry into application if the sponsor opted for the previous system. The Clinical Trial Regulation will overhaul the current system of approvals for clinical trials in the EU. Specifically, the legislation, which will be directly applicable in all member states, aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the EU. For instance, the legislation provides for a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point and strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical trial applications. 
 Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations 
 Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and use of pharmaceutical products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with third-party payors, existing or potential customers and referral sources are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, and these laws and regulations may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which manufacturers market, sell and distribute the products for which they obtain marketing approval. Such restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following: 
 •

 the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or kind, in exchange for, or to induce, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made 
 ​

 under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers, on the one hand, and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. The PPACA amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to commit a violation; 
 •

 the federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the civil False Claims Act (the “FCA”), which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, or making a false statement to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, also may implicate the FCA. In addition, the PPACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA; 
 ​
 •

 the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, certain other healthcare providers and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members; 
 ​
 •

 the federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; and 
 ​
 •

 state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 ​
 Violation of the laws described above or any other governmental laws and regulations may result in penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and imprisonment. Furthermore, efforts to ensure that business activities and business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations can be costly.
 Data Privacy and Security 
 •

 the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 
 ​
 •

 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and its implementing regulations, which imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the transmission, security and privacy of protected health information; and

 the General European Data Protection Regulation, which became applicable May 25, 2018, harmonizes data privacy laws across Europe. This Regulation lays down rules relating to the protection with regard to the processing of personal data and rules relating to the transfer of personal data, as well as an individual’s right to the protection of personal data, including medical information and clinical trial related data. 
 ​
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States, sales of any product candidates for which regulatory approval for commercial sale is obtained will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities and health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 In the EU, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. EU member states may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements. 
 Health Reform 
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of reform proposals to change the healthcare system. There is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. In the United States, for example, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected and continues to face major uncertainty due to the status of major legislative initiatives surrounding healthcare reform.
Additional Regulation 
 In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern the use, handling and disposal of various biologic, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. Equivalent laws have been adopted in other countries that impose similar obligations.

 U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), prohibits U.S. corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business abroad or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Equivalent laws have been adopted in other foreign countries that impose similar obligations. 
Competition
 Companies that are currently engaged in gene therapy or companies not yet focused on developing gene and cell therapies could at any time decide to develop therapies relevant to our business. Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of product candidates and commercializing those product candidates. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for product candidates and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors’ product candidates may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any product candidate we may commercialize and may render our treatments obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates. 
 Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and subject registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 
 We anticipate facing intense and increasing competition as new product candidates enter the market and advanced technologies become available. We expect any product candidates that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their product candidates more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.
