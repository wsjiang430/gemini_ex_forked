     ITEM 1.    BUSINESS 
  Overview 
         We are a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development of novel anti-infective agents to treat serious infections. We have two product candidates that have been submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, for approval: lefamulin, potentially the first pleuromutilin antibiotic available for oral and intravenous (or IV) administration in humans, for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, or CABP and CONTEPO, a potentially first-in-class epoxide antibiotic for IV use in the United States for complicated urinary tract infections, or cUTI. We may potentially develop lefamulin and CONTEPO for additional indications. Both lefamulin formulations and CONTEPO were granted Qualified Infectious Disease Product, or QIDP, and Fast Track designation by the FDA, enabling priority review of the New Drug Applications, or the NDAs by the FDA. 



Lefamulin 

         Lefamulin is a semi-synthetic pleuromutilin antibiotic discovered and developed by our team with the potential to be first-in-class for IV and oral administration in humans. It inhibits the synthesis of bacterial protein, which is required for bacteria to grow by binding with high affinity and specificity at molecular targets that are different than other antibiotic classes. Based on results from two global, Phase 3 clinical trials, we believe lefamulin is well-positioned for use as first-line monotherapy for the treatment of CABP due to its novel mechanism of action, targeted spectrum of activity, resistance profile, achievement of substantial drug concentrations in lung tissue and fluid, availability of oral and IV formulations and a generally well-tolerated profile. We believe lefamulin represents a potentially important new treatment option for the five to six million adults in the United States diagnosed with CABP each year. 
         We submitted two NDAs to the FDA for the oral and IV formulations of lefamulin for the treatment of CABP in December 2018. The FDA has granted us a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, target action date of August 19, 2019 for lefamulin. We plan to submit a marketing authorization application for lefamulin in Europe in the first half of 2019. The two NDAs for lefamulin are supported by two pivotal, Phase 3 clinical trials (known as LEAP 1 and LEAP 2) that evaluated the safety and efficacy of IV and oral lefamulin compared to moxifloxacin in the treatment of adults with CABP, including the option to switch from IV to oral administration and a short course oral treatment with lefamulin. In both LEAP 1 and LEAP 2, lefamulin was demonstrated to be non-inferior to moxifloxacin, and met both the FDA and European Medicines Agency, or EMA primary and secondary efficacy endpoints for the treatment of CABP. Lefamulin was also shown to be generally well-tolerated when administered both orally and intravenously. 
         We believe that pleuromutilin antibiotics can help address the major public health threat posed by bacterial resistance, which the World Health Organization, or WHO, characterized in 2017 as one of the biggest threats to human health. Increasing resistance to antibiotics used to treat CABP is a growing concern and has become an issue in selecting the appropriate initial antibiotic treatment prior to determining the specific microbiological cause of the infection, referred to as empiric treatment. For example, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, has classified  Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most common respiratory pathogen, as a serious threat to human health as a result of increasing resistance to currently available antibiotics. In addition, the CDC recently reported on the growing evidence of widespread resistance to macrolides, widely used antibiotics that disrupt bacterial protein synthesis, in  Mycoplasma pneumoniae, a common cause of CABP that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Furthermore,  Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, or MRSA, which has also been designated as a serious threat to human health by the CDC, 
 1

   has emerged as a more common cause of CABP in some regions of the world, and a possible pathogen to be covered with empiric therapy. 
         As a result of increasing resistance to antibiotics and the wide array of potential pathogens that cause CABP, the current standard of care for hospitalized patients with CABP whose treatment is initiated in the hospital usually involves first-line empiric treatment with a combination of antibiotics (cephalosporins and macrolides) to address all likely bacterial pathogens or monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone. Combination therapy presents the logistical challenge of administering multiple drugs with different dosing regimens, with some drugs available only as IV, and increases the risk of drug-drug interactions and the potential for serious side effects. Fluoroquinolones are associated with safety and tolerability concerns, including a relatively high risk for developing Clostridium difficile infection and increasing rates of resistance for uropathogens. We believe these concerns have resulted in a decreasing use of fluoroquinolones and restriction of their use within a growing number of hospitals. 
         The FDA has communicated safety information about fluoroquinolones, advising that when used systemically, in the form of tablets, capsules and injectable, fluoroquinolones are associated with disabling and potentially permanent serious side effects. In December 2018, the FDA warned prescribers of an increase in the occurrence of rare but serious events of ruptures or tears in the main artery of the body, called the aorta. These tears, called aortic dissections, or ruptures of an aortic aneurysm can lead to dangerous bleeding or even death. Prior communications pertaining to the safety of fluoroquinolones occurred in July 2018 (significant decreases in blood sugar and certain mental health side effects), July 2016 (disabling side effects of the tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, and central nervous system), May 2016 (restricting use for certain uncomplicated infections), August 2013 (peripheral neuropathy), and July 2008 (tendinitis and tendon rupture). The European Medicines Agency has also reviewed this class and have modified prescribing information restricting use, as well as outlining some of the safety risks. 
         Fluoroquinolones are typically administered in combination with other antibiotics, if community-acquired MRSA is suspected. In addition, many currently available antibiotic therapies are only available for IV administration and are prescribed for seven to fourteen days, meaning continued treatment requires prolonged hospitalization or a switch to a different antibiotic administered orally, with the attendant risk that the patient might respond differently. 
         Effective January 1, 2017, the Joint Commission & Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, began requiring all U.S. hospitals to have Antibiotic Management guidelines, also known as "Stewardship" Committees, in place to identify antibiotics most appropriate and targeted to each individual patient's infection. Past efforts to "cast the widest net possible" with broad-spectrum antibiotics that affect many types of bacteria have caused problems, such as C. difficile infections, by killing good bacteria or increased antibiotic resistance in other bacteria in different areas of the body. Additionally, in 2016, the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America, or IDSA/SHEA, updated their Antibiotic Stewardship guidelines for antibiotic use. We believe that three key goals from these guidelines are applicable to the treatment of CABP:
 

 Reduce the risk of antibiotics associated with a high risk of C. difficile infections; 
 Increase use of oral antibiotics as a strategy to improve outcomes or decrease costs; and 
 Reduce antibiotic therapy to the shortest effective duration. 

         Consistent with the Antimicrobial Stewardship principles, we believe that lefamulin could be well suited as either a first-line or second-line empiric monotherapy for the treatment of CABP patients in the hospital setting, outpatient-transition of care or in the community setting, because of its novel mechanism of action, complete spectrum of activity for CABP pathogens, including against multidrug 
 2

   resistant strains, achievement of substantial drug concentrations in lung fluids and lung immune cells, and flexibility as step down oral agent with both the IV and oral formulations and favorable safety and tolerability profile. 
 


CONTEPO 

         On July 24, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Zavante Therapeutics, Inc., or Zavante, a privately-held late clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel therapies to improve the outcomes of hospitalized patients. Zavante's lead product candidate is CONTEPO (fosfomycin for injection, previously referred to as ZTI-01 and ZOLYD). 
         We submitted an NDA for marketing approval of CONTEPO for the treatment of cUTI including AP in adults in the United States, to the FDA in October 2018. The NDA submission is utilizing the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway and is supported by a robust data package, including a pivotal Phase 2/3 clinical trial (known as ZEUS), which met its primary endpoint of statistical non-inferiority to piperacillin/tazobactam in patients with cUTI, including AP. The FDA has granted us a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA target action date of April 30, 2019 for CONTEPO. 
         The prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is increasing and is considered a significant threat to global health. In particular, the CDC and the WHO consider antibiotic resistance to be an urgent and critical threat to human health. The prevalence of lactamase enzymes among Gram-negative pathogens threatens the usefulness of many beta -lactam antibiotics and has resulted in greater reliance on last line antibiotics, including carbapenems. Complicated urinary tract infections, or cUTIs, including acute pyelonephritis, or AP, are among the most common infections due to multi-drug resistant, or MDR bacteria, including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE, and are often healthcare-associated. Global mortality attributable to CRE infections has been estimated in some studies to be over 20% and reflects the need for safe, alternative, carbapenem-sparing options. 
         CONTEPO is a novel, potentially first-in-class investigational IV antibiotic in the United States with a broad spectrum of Gram-negative and Gram-positive activity, including activity against most MDR strains such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-, or ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Intravenous fosfomycin has been approved for a number of indications and utilized for over 45 years in Europe to treat a variety of serious bacterial infections, including cUTIs. CONTEPO utilizes a new dosing regimen that optimizes its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. We believe these attributes, the extensive clinical experience worldwide and the positive efficacy and safety results from the Phase 2/3 clinical trial support CONTEPO as a first-line treatment for cUTIs, including AP, suspected to be caused by MDR pathogens. At least 20% of cUTIs are caused by MDR bacteria and limited treatment options are available in the U.S. In addition, non-clinical data have shown that CONTEPO acts in combination with certain other antibiotics to improve bacterial killing. 
   Our Strategy 
         Our goal is to become a biopharmaceutical company focused on the commercialization of novel anti-infective products. The key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are: 


 Maximize the commercial potential of CONTEPO for cUTI's and lefamulin for
CABP.  We own exclusive, worldwide rights to lefamulin and US rights to CONTEPO and we have out licensed the rights to lefamulin in China. We
expect that our initial target patient population for lefamulin will consist of patients with moderate to severe CABP and the initial target population for CONTEPO will be hospitalized patients with
complicated urinary tract infections. If either or both CONTEPO or lefamulin receives marketing approval from the FDA, we plan to commercialize them in the United States with our own targeted sales
and marketing organization that we plan to expand beyond its current levels. We believe both CONTEPO and lefamulin have innovative profiles which, if approved, would support their adoption in the 

 3

   

United
States for adult cUTI patients treaded in the hospital and CABP patients, respectively, treated as in-patients in a hospital setting. Lefamulin also has the opportunity to be adopted as
outpatient transition of care from the hospital, which we believe represents a significant commercial opportunity. We believe that we will be able to effectively communicate CONTEPO's and lefamulin's
differentiating characteristics and key attributes to clinicians, hospital pharmacies and payors with the goal of establishing favorable reimbursement as well as a favorable formulary status in
targeted hospitals. Outside the United States we expect to utilize a variety of types of collaboration, distribution and other marketing arrangements with one or more third parties to commercialize
lefamulin in such markets. We currently have a team of regional business directors and medical science liaisons in the field performing educational and market development activities, respectively. We
initially plan to use a targeted hospital-based sales force to promote both lefamulin formulations and CONTEPO, if approved. 


 Pursue the continued development of lefamulin in additional
indications.  We are evaluating the cost and benefits of the continued development of lefamulin for indications in addition to CABP. Pediatric
oral formulation development is ongoing, and we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial in pediatric patients in mid-2018. We believe lefamulin has potential to treat acute bacterial skin and skin
structure infection (ABSSSI), ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP) or hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP) and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). In addition, we may explore
longer duration of treatment with lefamulin to support development of a treatment for osteomyelitis and prosthetic joint infections. We believe that lefamulin would be differentiated from other
treatment options for these potential indications because of its novel mechanism of action, spectrum of activity, including activity against multi-drug resistant pathogens, achievement of substantial
concentrations in relevant tissues, availability as both an IV and oral formulation and favorable safety and tolerability profile. 
 Pursue the development of CONTEPO for a pediatric
indication.  We are evaluating the continued development of CONTEPO for use in pediatric patients with cUTIs. In June 2018, we initiated a
Phase 1, non-comparative, open-label study of the pharmacokinetics and safety of a single dose of CONTEPO in pediatric subjects less than 12 years of age. 
 Evaluate business development opportunities and potential
collaborations.  We may expand our product pipeline through opportunistically in-licensing or acquiring the rights to complementary products,
product candidates and technologies for the treatment of a range of infectious diseases or other hospital-based products that could utilize our planned commercial infrastructure. We plan to evaluate
the merits of entering into collaboration agreements with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies that may contribute to our ability to efficiently advance our product candidates, build our
product pipeline, concurrently advance a range of research and development programs and leverage our commercial infrastructure. Potential collaborations may provide us with funding and access to the
scientific, development, regulatory and commercial capabilities of the collaborators. We also plan to encourage local and international government entities and non-government organizations to provide
additional funding and support for our development programs. 

 Background 
   Anti-Bacterial Market and Scientific Overview 
         Bacteria are broadly classified as Gram-positive or Gram-negative. Gram-positive bacteria possess a single membrane and a thick cell wall and turn dark-blue or violet when subjected to a laboratory staining method known as Gram's method. Gram-negative bacteria have a thin cell wall layered between an inner cytoplasmic cell membrane and a bacterial outer membrane and, as a result, do not retain the violet stain used in Gram's method. Antibiotics that are active against both Gram-positive 
 4

   and Gram-negative bacteria are referred to as broad spectrum, while those that are active only against a select subset of Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria are referred to as narrow spectrum. Bacteria that cause infections are often referred to as bacterial pathogens. Because it often takes from 24 to 48 hours to definitively diagnose the particular bacterial pathogen causing an infection, the causative pathogen often remains unidentified and narrow spectrum antibiotics are not generally used as empiric monotherapy for first-line treatment of hospitalized patients with serious infections. 
         Since the introduction of antibiotics in the 1940s, numerous new antibiotic classes have been discovered and developed for therapeutic use. The development of new antibiotic classes and new antibiotics within a class is important because of the ability of bacteria to develop resistance to existing mechanisms of action of currently approved antibiotics. However, the pace of discovery and development of new antibiotic classes slowed considerably in the past few decades. The CDC estimates that the pathogens responsible for more than 70% of U.S. hospital infections are resistant to at least one of the antibiotics most commonly used to treat them. The CDC also estimated in 2013, based on data collected from evaluations performed between 2006 and 2011, that annually in the United States at least two million people become infected with bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics and at least 23,000 people die as a direct result of these infections. 
         Antibiotic resistance is primarily caused by genetic mutations in bacteria selected by exposure to antibiotics that do not kill all of the bacteria. In addition to mutated bacteria being resistant to the drug used for treatment, many bacterial strains can also become cross-resistant, meaning that they become resistant to multiple classes of antibiotics. As a result, the effectiveness of many antibiotics has declined, limiting physicians' options to treat serious infections and exacerbating a global health issue. For example, the WHO estimated in 2014 that people with infections caused by MRSA, a highly resistant form of bacteria, are 64% more likely to die than people with a non-resistant form of the infection. Resistance can increase the cost of healthcare because of the potential for lengthier hospital stays and more intensive care. Growing antibiotic resistance globally, together with the low level of investment in research and development, is considered one of the biggest global health threats. In 2010, the WHO stated that antibiotic resistance is one of the three greatest threats to human health. Partially in response to this threat, the U.S. Congress passed the GAIN Act in 2012, which provides incentives, including access to expedited FDA review for approval, fast track designation and five years of potential data exclusivity extension for the development of new QIDPs. Additional legislation is also being considered in the United States, including the Antibiotic Development to Advance Patient Treatment Act of 2013, which is intended to accelerate the development of anti-infective products, and the Developing an Innovative Strategy for Antimicrobial Resistant Microorganisms Act of 2014, which is intended to establish a new reimbursement framework to enable premium pricing of anti-infective products. 
         In 2017, sales of antibiotics totaled approximately $42 billion globally. Although judicious use of antibiotics is important to reduce the rate of antibiotic resistance, this approach alone cannot fully address the threat from increasing antibiotic resistance. New antibiotics, and particularly new antibiotic classes, are needed to ensure the availability of effective antibiotic therapy in the future. 
   Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia (CABP) 
   Market Overview 
         The U.S. National Center for Health Statistics estimated that between 1988 and 1994 there were approximately 5.6 million cases of pneumonia per year in the United States. More recently, based on our combined analysis of the CDC's 2007 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and 2013 data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project we estimate that over 5.0 million adults are treated annually for CABP in the United States and that the majority of these adult CABP patients have their treatment initiated in a hospital, including 
 5

   emergency departments. According to the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, or HCUP, in 2013, approximately 3.1 million adults sought treatment in a U.S. hospital for CABP. In addition, in 2013, approximately 2.4 million adults were admitted to U.S. hospitals for in-patient care with a diagnosis of CABP and approximately 700,000 adults were seen in an emergency department at U.S. hospitals for treatment of CABP and then released. 
         Additionally, in 2014, based on CDC data approximately 50,000 patients died from CABP in the United States. Based on data collected from July 1, 2012 through June 30, 2015, on the Medicare.gov Hospital Compare website, the current national rate of readmissions for Medicare pneumonia patients is 17.1%, which is the percentage of patients who have had a recent hospital stay that must return to a hospital for unplanned care within 30 days of being discharged. The national average death rate for Medicare pneumonia patients, excluding Medicare Advantage plan data, is 16.3%, which is the percentage of patients who die, for any reason, within 30 days of admission to a hospital. 
         Based on data from LexisNexis® Risk Solutions, a leading provider of healthcare data and analytics solutions, as well as analysis of data from US hospitals and other healthcare facilities, we determined that the number of adult CABP patients who were treated with antibiotic therapy in hospitals in the United States exceeded 3.8 million for full-year 2016. Our analysis of the LexisNexis data also indicates that approximately 2.4 million of these adult CABP patients were treated as inpatients with IV/injectable antibiotics, and we find that the majority of CABP patients enter the hospital inpatient setting following the initiation of antibiotic therapy during an Emergency Department (ED) visit. Additionally, our analyses show that approximately 1.4 million adult CABP patients were treated with antibiotic courses (IV or oral) in the ED or as hospital outpatients and subsequently released without hospital admission. 
         Additionally, approximately 1.4 million adult CABP patients were treated with antibiotic courses (IV or oral) in the ED or as hospital outpatients and subsequently released without hospital admission. Furthermore, as a result of our market research in 2017-18, we believe that once adult CABP patients are released from ED stays or are discharged from U.S. hospitals, approximately 60-70%, receive antibiotic oral outpatient prescriptions as continuation of their antibiotic treatment. As hospitals look to minimize the total cost of care and duration of hospital stay for CABP patients toward improved outcomes, efficient transition of adult CABP inpatients to an oral antibiotic treatment as outpatient therapy can significantly reduce days of hospitalization and overall treatment cost. 
         IQIVA estimated that in 2017 approximately 2 million adult CABP patients were actively treated with antibiotics from prescribers in community clinics, e.g. primary care offices and at other non-hospital based sites of urgent care. As a result, we believe that approximately 6 million CABP patients are treated with antibiotics in the United States on an annual basis and 6 out of every 10 adult CABP patients have treatment initiated in a hospital setting versus. the community setting. 
   Causes of CABP 
         Pneumonia can be caused by a variety of micro-organisms, with bacteria being the most common identifiable cause. CABP refers to bacterial pneumonia that is acquired outside of a hospital setting. Signs and symptoms of CABP include cough, fever, sputum production and chest pain. A number of different types of bacteria can cause CABP, including both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Pneumonia that is caused by atypical bacterial pathogens often has different symptoms and responds to different antibiotics than pneumonia caused by pathogens referred to as typical bacteria. However, atypical bacteria are not uncommon. The most common bacterial pathogens noted in current treatment guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America, or IDSA, for hospitalized CABP patients who are not in the intensive care unit are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Legionella species. In addition, IDSA notes the emergence of resistance to commonly utilized antibiotics for CABP, specifically drug-resistant 
 6

    S. pneumoniae and community-acquired MRSA, or CA-MRSA, as a major consideration in choosing empiric therapy. However, a majority of patients do not have a pathogen identified using routine diagnostic tests available to physicians. 
   Currently Available Treatment Options 
         In 2007, based on the most likely bacteria to cause CABP, IDSA and the American Thoracic Society, or ATS, recommend empiric treatment of hospitalized patients with CABP who do not require treatment in an intensive care unit with either:


 a combination of a cephalosporin, an antibiotic that disrupts the cell wall of bacteria, plus a macrolide, an antibiotic that disrupts
bacterial protein synthesis; or 
 monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone, an antibiotic that disrupts bacterial protein synthesis. 

         In the event CA-MRSA is suspected, these guidelines recommend that vancomycin, an antibiotic that disrupts the cell wall of bacteria, or linezolid, an antibiotic that disrupts bacterial protein synthesis, be used or added to the current regimen. 
         In addition, physicians need to be aware of the local susceptibility profiles of the common bacterial pathogens associated with CABP because of increasing resistance to first-line antibiotics. For example, rates of pneumococcal resistance to recommended first-line macrolides exceed 40% in some areas, while resistance in M. pneumoniae associated with severe disease has been recently reported by the CDC in the United States. 
   Limitations of Currently Available Treatment Options 
         When confronted with a new patient suffering from a serious infection caused by an unknown pathogen, a physician may be required to quickly initiate first-line empiric antibiotic treatment, often with a combination of antibiotics, to stabilize the patient prior to definitively diagnosing the particular bacterial infection. However, currently available antibiotic therapies for first-line empiric treatment of CABP suffer from significant limitations. 
 Bacterial Resistance and Spectrum of Activity 
         As a result of bacterial resistance, the effectiveness of many antibiotics has declined. For example, the CDC estimates that in 30% of severe  S. pneumoniae cases, the bacterial pathogen is fully resistant to one or more clinically relevant antibiotics, with 44% of strains resistant to a macrolide in the United States. In addition, fluoroquinolone resistance in S. pneumoniae has increased from less than 0.5% to more than 3% of cases in some regions of North America, which parallels increased total fluoroquinolone prescriptions. Antibiotic resistance has a significant impact on mortality and contributes heavily to healthcare system costs worldwide. According to the CDC, cases of resistant pneumococcal pneumonia result in 32,000 additional doctor visits, approximately 19,000 additional hospitalizations and 7,000 deaths each year. None of the currently available treatment options provides a spectrum of antibacterial coverage as a monotherapy that sufficiently covers all of the most common bacterial causes of CABP, including multi-drug resistant strains. 
 Difficult, Inconvenient and Costly Regimens 
         Currently available antibiotics used to treat CABP and other serious infections can be difficult, inconvenient and costly to administer. Physicians typically prefer IV administration for patients hospitalized with more serious illness to ensure adequate delivery of the drug rapidly. Many IV antibiotics are prescribed for seven to 14 days or more and patients can be hospitalized for much or all of this period or require in-home IV therapy. The diagnosis related group, or DRG, reimbursement 
 7

   system often used in the U.S. hospital setting pays a fixed fee for an episode of CABP that may not fully compensate hospitals for the duration of hospitalized care. Prolonged IV treatment that extends the period of hospitalization may cause hospital costs to increase in excess of the fixed reimbursement fee, resulting in significant negative impact on healthcare institutions. In addition, to address all likely bacterial pathogens in a patient with a more serious illness, IDSA guidelines recommend using a combination of antibiotics. Combination therapy presents the logistical challenge of administering multiple drugs with different dosing regimens and increases the risk of drug-drug interactions. While IV treatment delivers the drug more rapidly than is possible orally, once a patient is stabilized, oral treatment with the same drug would allow for more convenient and cost-effective out-patient treatment. Because many commonly used antibiotics are only available in IV form, a switch to an oral therapy requires changing to a different antibiotic, which may be less effective for the patient. 
   Adverse Effects 
         Currently available antibiotic therapies can have serious side effects. These side effects may include severe allergic reaction, decreased blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, suppression of platelets, pain and inflammation at the site of injection, muscle, renal and oto-toxicity, optic and peripheral neuropathies and headaches. At times, these side effects may be significant and require discontinuation of therapy. As a result, some treatments require clinicians to closely monitor patients' blood levels and other parameters, increasing the expense and inconvenience of treatment. This risk may be increased with combination therapy, which exposes patients to potential adverse effects from each of the antibiotics used in treatment. For example, fluoroquinolones are associated with tendon rupture and peripheral neuropathy. In addition, fluoroquinolones have been associated with an increased frequency of C. difficile colitis, an overgrowth of a bacteria in the colon that produces a toxin that results in inflammation of the colon and repeated bouts of watery diarrhea. This has resulted in limitations on the use of fluoroquinolones in several countries. In November 2015, the FDA convened an Advisory Committee meeting to review the benefits and risks of fluoroquinolones in less severe indications, such as uncomplicated UTI, acute bacterial sinusitis and acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. Based on the committee's recommendation, in July 2016, the FDA approved changes to the labels of fluoroquinolones to indicate that fluoroquinolones should be reserved for use in patients who have no other treatment options for the indications mentioned above, because the risk of these serious side effects generally outweighs the benefits in these patients. These changes included a requirement that a separate patient Medication Guide be given with each prescription that describes the safety issues associated with this class of drugs. In December 2018, an FDA review found that fluoroquinolone antibiotics can increase the occurrence of rare but serious events of ruptures or tears in the main artery of the body, called the aorta. These tears, called aortic dissections, or ruptures of an aortic aneurysm can lead to dangerous bleeding or even death. They can occur with fluoroquinolones for systemic use given by mouth or through an injection. 
   cUTIs
  Market Overview 
         Infections due to a bacterial pathogen that is resistant to three or more antibiotic classes have become increasingly common and present a risk to our fight against infectious diseases and the management of complications in vulnerable patients. According to the CDC, more than two million hospital infections caused by bacteria resistant to one or more antibiotics occur every year in the United States, and over 23,000 patients with an antibiotic-resistant pathogen die each year. 
         The prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is increasing and is considered a significant threat to global health. In particular, the CDC and the WHO consider antibiotic resistance to be an urgent and critical threat to human health. The prevalence of Beta-lactamase enzymes among Gram-negative 
 8

   pathogens threatens the usefulness of many Beta-lactam antibiotics and has resulted in greater reliance on last line antibiotics, including carbapenems. 
         CUTIs, including AP, are among the most common infections due to MDR bacteria, including CRE, and are often healthcare-associated. Global mortality attributable to CRE infections has been estimated in some studies to be over 20% and reflects the need for safe, alternative, carbapenem-sparing 
         Surveillance and epidemiological studies suggest that some traditional, first-line antibiotics may no longer be acceptable choices for early therapy. In one large-scale surveillance study, approximately one out of three patients hospitalized in the United States with cUTI, a complicated intra-abdominal infection, hospital-associated pneumonia, or a bloodstream infection did not receive timely effective antibiotic therapy, and this delay was associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The rate of antibiotic resistance appears to be two to four times higher in patients who were admitted to the hospital from a nursing home or were recently hospitalized. Antibiotic therapy within the past six months has also been identified as a risk factor for antibiotic resistance. 
         New classes of antibiotics that are effective against drug-resistant pathogens are needed for early, appropriate treatment of serious infections in hospitalized patients and to treat patients who have failed to respond to standard, first-line antibiotics due to acquired drug resistance. 
         For over 45 years, oral and IV formulations of fosfomycin have been used in the European Union, Africa, Asia, and South America, and an oral formulation of fosfomycin has been used in the United States and Canada for the treatment of a variety of indications. Oral fosfomycin is available in the United States as single-dose therapy for cystitis and is noted as an appropriate treatment option for cystitis in treatment guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the CDC. However, oral administration of fosfomycin provides inadequate concentrations required for treatment of more serious infections due to its limited bioavailability and dose-limiting gastrointestinal tolerability. 
         Outside of the United States, IV fosfomycin is approved for patients with a variety of infections, often severe, including cUTI, bacteremia, osteomyelitis, nosocomial lower respiratory tract infections, surgical site infections, bone and joint infections, endocarditis, skin infections and bacterial meningitis. The efficacy and safety profile of IV fosfomycin has been established by more than 45 years of clinical use outside of the United States and has been evaluated in more than 60 clinical studies. Fosfomycin has retained high in vitro activity with a low and stable resistance profile, and continues to be suitable for use as a monotherapy for cUTI despite long term use. 
   Causes of cUTIs 
         cUTI is defined as a clinical syndrome characterized by pyuria and a documented microbial pathogen on culture of urine or blood, accompanied by local and systemic signs and symptoms, including fever, chills, malaise, flank pain, back pain or costo-vertebral angle pain or tenderness that occur in the presence of a functional or anatomical abnormality of the urinary tract, or in the presence of catheterization. Indwelling urethral catheters account for 70% to 80% of cUTIs, or 1 million cases per year in the United States. Catheter-associated UTI is the most common cause of secondary bloodstream infections and is linked to increased morbidity and mortality. Patients with pyelonephritis, regardless of underlying abnormalities of the urinary tract, are considered a subset of patients with cUTI. 
         cUTI are usually caused by a greater variety of pathogens, with a greater likelihood of associated antimicrobial resistance, than uncomplicated UTIs, or uUTIs. Escherichia coli, or E. coli, is isolated in approximately 75% to 95% of uUTIs and approximately 50% of cUTIs and is the most common etiologic agent of cUTIs. Additional commonly-identified Gram-negative uropathogens include other Enterobacteriaceae (such as Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp., Enterobacter cloacae) and non-fermenting 
 9

   Gram-negative bacilli (such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or P. aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter spp.). Gram-positive organisms, such as Enterococci and coagulase-negative Staphylococci, may also be contributing pathogens. 
   Limitations of Currently Available Treatment Options 
         We believe bacterial resistance against antimicrobials has created the need for more antibiotic treatment options, particularly among MDR, Gram-negative bacilli (including CRE, ESBL, producers, and MDR P. aeruginosa). Gram-negative antimicrobial resistance is particularly common among urinary tract pathogens. Enterobacteriaceae, including E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, or K. pneumoniae, may acquire plasmids that encode ESBLs and confer resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and other broad-spectrum antibiotics. Third-generation cephalosporins and Beta-lactamase inhibitors, or BLIs, are also commonly ineffective against Enterobacteriaceae that generate AmpC enzymes. 
         The recent spread into hospitals of Enterobacteriaceae expressing emergent Beta-lactamases, including members of the serine carbapenemases and metallo-Beta-lactamases, endanger antibiotic options. The lack of available and effective antibiotic classes for these organisms has created an unmet medical need. For example, infections with CRE are difficult to treat, as there are limited treatment choices available. Mortality rates as high as 40% to 50% have been associated with CRE infections, making them a serious threat to public health. The available treatment choices are associated with serious potential toxicity, in the case of colistin and aminoglycosides, or concerns of allergy or hypersensitivity, in the case of Beta-lactams or penicillin derivatives. 
   Our Solution: CONTEPO for the Treatment of cUTI 
 

 CONTEPO is an IV formulation of fosfomycin and the sole member of the epoxide antibiotic class. 
 CONTEPO has a different mechanism of action than other IV antibiotics in the United States. 
 CONTEPO has a broad spectrum of in vitro activity against a variety of clinically important MDR
Gram-negative pathogens, including ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, CRE, and Gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus, or MRSA, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. 
 CONTEPO has demonstrated in in vitro studies additivity or synergy when used in combination
with other classes of antibiotic agents in pre-clinical trials. 
 CONTEPO has a small molecular size, which may enable high levels of tissue penetration and facilitates renal elimination, both of which are
important for treatment of cUTIs. 
 CONTEPO is supported by a long history of IV fosfomycin use outside the United States in a variety of indications, including cUTI. 
 CONTEPO has completed the ZEUS Study, a pivotal registrational Phase 2/3 clinical trial in cUTI, achieving non-inferiority to an
active comparator. 

         CONTEPO is a potentially first-in-class epoxide IV antibiotic in the United States with a broad spectrum of bactericidal Gram-negative and Gram-positive activity, including activity against many contemporary MDR strains that threaten hospitalized patients. IV fosfomycin has an extensive commercial history in markets outside the United States, where it has been used broadly for over 45 years to treat a variety of indications, including complicated urinary tract infections, bacteremia, pneumonia and skin infections. 
 10

          
        CONTEPO works differently than other IV antibiotics approved in the United States. CONTEPO inhibits an early step in bacterial cell wall synthesis, so the cell wall lacks integrity and the bacteria die quickly. We believe that because of its different mechanism of action, we have not observed any cross resistance to date between CONTEPO and any of the existing classes of intravenous antibiotics. In addition, CONTEPO has demonstrated in in vitro studies an additive or synergistic antibacterial effect with other classes of antibiotics when used in combination therapy, and has been shown to restore susceptibility in resistant strains. 
   Our Product Development Pipeline 
   Lefamulin 
   Overview 
         Lefamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of the naturally occurring antibiotic, pleuromutilin, which was originally identified from a fungus called Pleurotus mutilius. Lefamulin inhibits the synthesis of bacterial protein, which is required for bacteria to grow. Lefamulin acts by binding to the peptidyl transferase center, or PTC, on the bacterial ribosome in such a way that it interferes with the interaction of protein production at two key sites known as the "A" site and the "P" site, resulting in the inhibition of bacterial proteins and the cessation of bacterial growth. Lefamulin's binding occurs with high affinity, high specificity and at molecular sites that are different than other antibiotic classes. We believe that lefamulin's novel mechanism of action is responsible for the lack of cross-resistance with other antibiotic classes that we have observed in our preclinical studies and clinical trials and a low propensity for development of bacterial resistance to lefamulin. The binding of lefamulin to the PTC on the bacterial ribosome is depicted in the graphic below. 
 
        We believe that lefamulin is well suited to be used empirically as monotherapy for the treatment of respiratory tract infections, such as CABP, because of its spectrum of antibacterial activity against both the typical and atypical pathogens causing CABP, including multi-drug resistant pathogens such as MRSA. In addition, in preclinical studies, lefamulin showed potent antibacterial activity against a variety of Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria and atypical bacteria, including multi-drug resistant strains. In preclinical studies and in Phase 1 clinical trials, lefamulin achieved substantial concentrations in the epithelial lining fluid, or ELF, of the lung, the site infected during pneumonia. Lefamulin also provides the ability to switch from IV to oral therapy and maintain therapy with the same antibacterial treatment. The efficacy of lefamulin in humans has been shown in a 
 11

   proof-of-concept clinical Phase 3 trial with 207 patients with ABSSSI (acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections) comparing two lefamulin doses (100 mg and 150 mg i.v. q12 h) with vancomycin (³ 1 000 mg) over 5-14 days. This trial enrolled patients with severe skin and skin structure infections, excluding any patients with minor and uncomplicated infections. In total, 90.8 % of patients in the Modified Intent to Treat, or mITT population had S. aureus infection; 69.1 % of patients had MRSA. There were consistent high response rates seen across all three treatment arms, across a wide range of clinical and microbiological outcomes. Furthermore, no development of resistance was observed for lefamulin or for vancomycin during the trial. Lefamulin treatment administered intravenously over 5 to 14 days was well tolerated. The types of treatment-emergent adverse events were consistent with a patient population under treatment for ABSSSI. Lefamulin prolonged the cardiac de- and repolarization duration but otherwise had a similar cardiac safety profile as vancomycin as assessed with standard 12-lead ECGs. The results of the clinical Phase 2 trial in ABSSSI provided the first proof of concept for the systemic use of a pleuromutilin antibiotic for the treatment of serious bacterial infections in humans. Thereafter, the clinical program for lefamulin progressed with completion of two Phase 3 clinical trials in CABP (LEAP 1, LEAP 2). These trials demonstrated that lefamulin treatment, administered as IV only, IV to oral, and oral only regimens, was non-inferior to the standard of care moxifloxacin for the treatment of adults with CABP. Each trial provided independent evidence of the treatment effect and safety in this population with unmet medical need. 
         The FDA has designated each of the IV and oral formulations of lefamulin as a QIDP which provides for the extension of statutory exclusivity periods in the United States for an additional five years upon FDA approval of the product for the treatment of CABP and granted fast track designation to these formulations of lefamulin. Fast track designation is granted by the FDA to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs that treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need. The fast track designation for the IV and oral formulations of lefamulin will allow for more frequent interactions with the FDA, the opportunity for a rolling review of any NDAs, we submit and eligibility for priority review and a shortening of the FDA's goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months. Two NDAs for IV and oral formulations of lefamulin for treatment of CABP were submitted to the FDA December 19, 2018. We plan to submit a marketing authorization application for lefamulin in Europe in the first half of 2019. 
         We own exclusive, worldwide rights to lefamulin, other than our rights in China which were licensed to Sinovant. Lefamulin is protected by issued patents in the United States, Europe and Japan covering composition of matter, which are scheduled to expire no earlier than 2028. We also have been granted patents for lefamulin relating to process and pharmaceutical crystalline salt forms in the United States, which are scheduled to expire no earlier than 2031. In addition, we own a family of pending patent applications directed to pharmaceutical compositions of lefamulin, which if issued would be scheduled to expire no earlier than 2036. 
   Key Attributes of Lefamulin 
         We believe that the combination of the following key attributes of lefamulin, observed in clinical trials and preclinical studies, differentiates lefamulin from currently available antibiotics and make lefamulin well suited for use as a first-line or second-line empiric monotherapy for the treatment of CABP. 
         The preclinical studies and clinical trials we have conducted to date suggest that lefamulin's novel mechanism of action is responsible for the low risk of cross resistance observed with other antibiotic classes and a low propensity for development of bacterial resistance to lefamulin. As a result of the favorable safety and tolerability profile we have observed in our clinical trials to date, we believe lefamulin has the potential to present fewer complications relative to the use of current therapies. Based on our research, we also believe that the availability of both IV and oral formulations of 
 12

   lefamulin, and an option to switch to oral treatment, could reduce the length of a patient's hospital stay and the overall cost of care. 
   Targeted Spectrum of Activity for CABP Pathogens and Low Propensity for the Development of Bacterial Resistance 
         We expect lefamulin's spectrum of antibacterial activity against typical and atypical pathogens could eliminate the need to use a combination of antibiotics for the treatment of CABP. In our completed Phase 2 clinical trial, IV lefamulin achieved a high cure rate against multi-drug resistant Gram-positive bacteria, including MRSA. In addition, in preclinical studies, lefamulin showed activity against a variety of Gram-positive bacteria, including S. pneumoniae and  S. aureus, that are resistant to other classes of antibiotics, Gram-negative bacteria, including  H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis, and atypical bacteria, including  C. pneumoniae, M. pneumoniae and  L. pneumophila. Included in lefamulin's spectrum of activity are all bacterial pathogens identified by IDSA as the most common causes of CABP for hospitalized patients who are not in the intensive care unit, as well as strains of the above listed bacteria that are resistant to other classes of antibiotics, including penicillins, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones and macrolides. 
         Based on observations from our preclinical studies and clinical trials of lefamulin, as well as industry experience with pleuromutilins used in veterinary medicine over the last 39 years, we believe that lefamulin's novel mechanism of action is responsible for the low risk of cross-resistance observed with other antibiotic classes and a low propensity for development of bacterial resistance to lefamulin. 
   Convenient Dosing Regimen; Potential for Switching from IV to Oral Treatment 
         We have developed both an IV and oral formulation of lefamulin, which we utilized in our clinical trials of lefamulin for the treatment of CABP. The administration of lefamulin as a monotherapy avoids the need for the complicated dosing regimens typical of multi-drug cocktails. We believe the availability of both IV and oral administration, and an option to switch to oral treatment, would be more convenient for patients and could reduce the length of a patient's hospital stay and the overall cost of care. The potential reduction in the overall cost of care could be particularly meaningful to healthcare institutions, as the DRG reimbursement system pays a fixed fee for the treatment of CABP regardless of the length of hospital stay. 
         The efficacy and safety of lefamulin in adult patients with CABP was shown in two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials (LEAP 1 and LEAP 2). The two trials were designed in accordance with US and EU regulatory guidelines and conducted in parallel from 2016 to 2018. Design elements of the Phase 3 clinical trials were broadly comparable. Both were global, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, non-inferiority studies to establish the efficacy and safety of lefamulin against the standard-of-care moxifloxacin in the treatment of adult subjects with CABP. In LEAP 1, subjects were treated with IV study drug and could be switched to oral study drug at the discretion of the Investigator after 3 full days (6 doses) of IV treatment if, in the opinion of the Investigator, pre-defined criteria were met. In LEAP 2, subjects were treated with lefamulin for five days (ten doses) compared to seven days of moxifloxacin (seven doses). 
   LEAP 1 (IV to Oral) Phase 3 Clinical Trial 
         In LEAP 1, a total of 551 subjects with Pneumonia Outcomes Research Team (PORT) Risk Class III to V who required IV antibiotic therapy as initial treatment for the current episode of CABP were randomized 1:1 to treatment with lefamulin 150 mg IV every 12 hours (n=276) or moxifloxacin 400 mg IV every 24 hours (n=275). Subjects could be switched from IV to oral study drug (lefamulin 600 mg orally every 12 hours or moxifloxacin 400 mg orally every 24 hours) at the discretion of the Investigator after three full days (six doses) of IV treatment if pre-defined criteria were met. If the 
 13

   investigator determined that MRSA was a probable pathogen at Screening, adjunctive linezolid 600 mg IV every 12 hours was to be added to the moxifloxacin group and linezolid placebo was to be added to the lefamulin group. 
         The protocol defined different primary endpoints for the FDA and EMA to address regional differences in regulatory requirements for the development of antibacterial drugs to treat CABP. The FDA primary endpoint (EMA secondary endpoint) was the percentage of subjects with an Early Clinical Response, or ECR, of responder at 96 ± 24-hours after the first dose of study drug in the Intent-to-treat, or ITT, Analysis Set. The EMA co-primary endpoints (FDA secondary endpoints) were the percentages of subjects with an Investigator's Assessment of Clinical Response (IACR) of success at Test of Cure (TOC) Visit (5 to 10 days after the last dose of study drug) in the mITT and Clinically Evaluable at Test of Cure, or CE-TOC Analysis Sets. 
         Of the 551 subjects randomized, 546 received any amount of study drug (Safety Analysis Set: 273 lefamulin, 273 moxifloxacin). The mean total duration of study drug treatment (IV and oral combined) was approximately seven days in each treatment group. The two treatment groups were generally well balanced with respect to demographics and baseline characteristics. Overall, 59.9% of subjects were male. The overall mean age was 60.3 years; 43.6% were ³65 years and 18.1% were ³75 years. Overall, 72.1% of subjects were classified as PORT Risk Class III, 26.5% were PORT Risk Class IV, and 1.3% were PORT Risk Class V. 
         LEAP 1 met its primary objective and demonstrated that lefamulin is non-inferior to moxifloxacin with or without adjunctive linezolid for the treatment of adult subjects with CABP based on the FDA and EMA primary endpoints. The ECR responder rate (FDA primary endpoint) was 87.3% in the lefamulin group and 90.2% in the moxifloxacin group (treatment difference 2.9%; 95% CI: 8.5, 2.8). The lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference in ECR responder rates was greater than the non-inferiority margin of 12.5%. Success rates for IACR at TOC (EMA co-primary endpoints) were 81.7% in the lefamulin group and 84.2% in the moxifloxacin group (treatment difference 2.6%; 95% CI: 8.9, 3.9) in the mITT group, and 86.9% in the lefamulin group and 89.4% in the moxifloxacin group (treatment difference 2.5%; 95% CI: 8.4, 3.4) in the CE-TOC group. The lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference in IACR success rates was greater than the non-inferiority margin of 10% for both groups. 
         Early Clinical Response rates for the most frequently identified baseline pathogens in the Microbiological Intent-to-treat, or microITT, group were:  S. pneumoniae (88.2% lefamulin vs 93.8% moxifloxacin), H. influenzae (92.2% lefamulin vs 94.7% moxifloxacin), M. catarrhalis (92.0% lefamulin vs 100.0% moxifloxacin), M. pneumoniae (84.2% lefamulin vs 90.0% moxifloxacin),  L. pneumophila (88.9% lefamulin vs 85.7% moxifloxacin), and C. pneumoniae (90.9% lefamulin vs 94.7% moxifloxacin). ECR responder rates for S. aureus were 100.0% in both treatment groups. Responder rates among resistant pathogens were high in the lefamulin group (eg, 100.0% for penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae [PISP], penicillin-resistant  S. pneumoniae [PRSP], multi-drug resistant S. pneumoniae, or MDRSP, and macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae), although the number of resistant pathogens was low. 
         Both lefamulin and moxifloxacin were well tolerated in the IV ± oral treatment regimens administered in the study. A similar rate of treatment-emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, was observed (38.1% vs 37.7% in the lefamulin and moxifloxacin groups, respectively). Gastrointestinal events were the most frequently reported TEAEs in both treatment groups (6.6% lefamulin, 13.6% moxifloxacin), with the difference between groups driven by an imbalance in TEAEs of diarrhea (0.7% lefamulin, 7.7% moxifloxacin). No gastrointestinal TEAEs led to discontinuation of study drug in either treatment group. 
         Administration site reactions of any type occurred more frequently for lefamulin (7.7%) than moxifloxacin (3.7%). The most common individual TEAE was infusion site pain, affecting eight (2.9%) 
 14

   subjects in the lefamulin group, and no subjects in the moxifloxacin group. One subject in each treatment group had an infusion site reaction that led to discontinuation of study drug. 
         The incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug was 2.9% and 4.4% for the lefamulin and moxifloxacin groups, respectively. The only TEAE preferred terms leading to discontinuation for more than 1 subject per treatment group were electrocardiogram (ECG) QT prolonged (one lefamulin-treated subject and three moxifloxacin-treated subjects) and infectious pleural effusion (one lefamulin-treated subject and two moxifloxacin-treated subjects). 
         Serious TEAEs occurred in 7.0% of subjects in the lefamulin group and 4.8% of subjects in the moxifloxacin group and were most frequently reported in the Infections and Infestations System Organ Class,or SOC (2.9% lefamulin, 1.5% moxifloxacin). 
         Nine deaths (five in the lefamulin group and, four in the moxifloxacin group) occurred by Day 28. Two additional deaths were reported after Day 28 (i.e., after the intended Late Follow-up [LFU] Visit): one lefamulin-treated subject on Day 32 and one moxifloxacin-treated subject on Day 48. None of the deaths was assessed as related to study drug by the Investigators. 
         There were no clinically meaningful trends or pattern of changes identified in hematology or chemistry laboratory parameters. No subjects met Hy's Law criteria. 
   LEAP 2 (Oral Only) Phase 3 Clinical Trial 
         In LEAP 2, a total of 738 subjects with PORT Risk Class II to IV who were appropriate candidates for oral antibiotic therapy for the current episode of CABP were randomized 1:1 to treatment with lefamulin (n=370) or moxifloxacin (n=368). Subjects received either lefamulin 600 mg orally every 12 hours for 5 days (10 doses) or moxifloxacin 400 mg orally every 24 hours for seven days (seven doses). The primary and secondary objectives were identical to those in LEAP 1. 
         Of the 738 subjects randomized, 736 received any amount of study drug (Safety Analysis Set: 368 lefamulin, 368 moxifloxacin). The mean duration of exposure to active lefamulin was 5.0 days, compared with 6.7 days of active moxifloxacin, which reflects the intended duration of active treatment for each drug as per the study design. The two treatment groups were generally well balanced with respect to demographics and baseline characteristics. Overall, 52.4% of subjects were male. The overall mean age was 57.5 years; 37.5% were ³65 years and 16.3% were ³75 years. Overall, 50.4% of subjects were classified as PORT Risk Class II, 37.7% were PORT Risk Class III, and 11.1% were PORT Risk Class IV. 
         LEAP 2 met its primary objective and demonstrated that lefamulin is non-inferior to moxifloxacin for the treatment of adult subjects with CABP based on the FDA and EMA primary endpoints. The ECR responder rate (FDA primary endpoint) was 90.8% in the lefamulin group and 90.8% in the moxifloxacin group (treatment difference 0.1%; 95% CI: 4.4, 4.5). The lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference in ECR responder rates was greater than the non-inferiority margin of 10%. Success rates for IACR at TOC (EMA co-primary endpoints) were 87.5% in the lefamulin group and 89.1% in the moxifloxacin group (treatment difference 1.6%; 95% CI: 6.3, 3.1) in the mITT group, and 89.7% in the lefamulin group and 93.6% in the moxifloxacin group (treatment difference 3.9%; 95% CI: 8.2, 0.5) in the CE-TOC group. The lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference in IACR success rates was greater than the non-inferiority margin of 10% for both groups. 
         Early Clinical Response rates for the most frequently identified baseline pathogens in the microITT group were: S. pneumoniae (89.4% lefamulin vs 91.3% moxifloxacin), H. influenzae (89.3% lefamulin vs 91.7% moxifloxacin), M. pneumoniae (100.0% in both groups), M. catarrhalis (85.7% lefamulin vs 100.0% moxifloxacin), L. pneumophila (81.3% lefamulin vs 94.1% moxifloxacin), and  C. pneumoniae (93.8% lefamulin vs 100.0% moxifloxacin). ECR responder rates for S. aureus were 100.0% in both treatment groups. Responder rates among resistant pathogens were high in the 
 15

   lefamulin group (eg, 100.0% for PISP, PRSP, MDRSP, and MRSA), although the number of resistant pathogens was low. 
         Both lefamulin and moxifloxacin were well tolerated in the oral treatment regimens administered in the study. The overall incidence of TEAEs was higher in the lefamulin group (32.6%) than in the moxifloxacin group (25.0%), which was driven by a difference in the incidence of mild/moderate Gastrointestinal Disorders. For lefamulin and moxifloxacin, respectively, the most frequently reported individual TEAEs in this category (and for the study overall) were diarrhea (12.2% vs 1.1%), nausea (5.2% vs 1.9%), and vomiting (3.3% vs 0.8%). Among the lefamulin-treated subjects reporting each of these TEAEs, approximately 75% had mild events and the remainder had moderate events. The only severe gastrointestinal adverse event, which was also serious, was a case of inguinal hernia strangulated in a moxifloxacin-treated subject. There were no severe or serious gastrointestinal adverse events among lefamulin-treated subjects. Furthermore, gastrointestinal events led to study drug discontinuation for 3 lefamulin-treated subjects (due to vomiting or abdominal pain) and one moxifloxacin-treated subject (due to vomiting). One patient who had a positive clinical response to lefamulin was later diagnosed with a C. difficile infection during an extended hospital stay. 
         The incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug was 3.3% for the lefamulin group and 2.4% for the moxifloxacin group. 
         Serious TEAEs occurred in 4.6% of lefamulin-treated subjects and 4.9% of moxifloxacin-treated subjects, most frequently in the Infections and Infestations category (2.4% and 1.4%, respectively). 
         In each treatment group, three (0.8%) subjects died by Day 28. Deaths of two additional lefamulin-treated subjects were reported after Day 28 (i.e., after the intended LFU Visit): one subject on Day 57 and one subject on Day 271. None of the deaths was assessed as related to study drug by the Investigators. 
         No clinically meaningful trends or pattern of changes were identified in hematology or chemistry laboratory parameters. Two unique lefamulin-treated subjects had either an ALT or an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) value >10 × the upper limit of normal, or ULN; in both cases the transaminase increases were transient with no associated increase in serum bilirubin. No subjects met Hy's Law criteria. 
         Electrocardiogram analyses demonstrated increases from baseline in the QTcF interval in both treatment groups, but the magnitude of the change in the lefamulin treatment group was smaller than that caused by moxifloxacin. In this study the mean change from baseline in QTcF interval at the steady state assessment was 9.5 msec for lefamulin and 11.6 msec for moxifloxacin. Post-baseline QTcF increases of >60 msec occurred in 1.1% of lefamulin-treated subjects and 1.9% of moxifloxacin-treated subjects. No associated cardiac arrhythmias of concern were observed. No adverse trends in vital signs in either treatment group were observed. 
   Phase 1 Pediatric Clinical Trial 
         Not unlike treatment of infectious diseases in adults, the management of pediatric infections has become more difficult due to the continuing rise in resistance in bacteria. Further complicating antimicrobial selection in the pediatric population is the need for agents to be very well tolerated and available in a final dosage form that can be easily administered to children. Based upon the in vitro antimicrobial spectrum of activity, along with the safety profile observed to date, we believe lefamulin is appropriate for evaluation for the treatment of a variety of pediatric infections, including those affecting the respiratory tract and skin and skin structure. We have an agreed Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PiP, and Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, with the EMA and FDA, respectively. Pediatric oral formulation development is ongoing and we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial in pediatric patients in mid-2018.

     Additional Potential Indications for Lefamulin 
   STIs 
         Urethritis and cervicitis caused by N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis or M. genitalium are frequently occurring sexually transmitted infections in the United States and Europe. Left untreated, these infections can cause serious health problems, particularly in women, including chronic pelvic pain, life-threatening ectopic pregnancy and infertility. Resistance in these organisms to the most commonly prescribed antibacterial treatments poses a serious public health threat. For example, the CDC estimates that 30% of the clinical isolates of N. gonorrhoeae are resistant to at least one currently available antibiotic. 
         In preclinical studies, lefamulin has shown high potency against N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis and M. genitalium, including strains resistant to currently available antibacterial agents. As a result, we are actively assessing a non-clinical and clinical development plan to support the development of lefamulin as a first-line treatment for urethritis, cervicitis and pelvic inflammatory disease. 
 Osteomyelitis 
         The incidence of osteomyelitis, which is an infection of the bone, is increasing. The most common causative organism is  S. aureus. In the United States, the prevalence of MRSA in these cases ranges from 33% to 55%. Up to 90% of cases of hematogenous osteomyelitis, most frequently in children, are caused by S. aureus. We believe that lefamulin has the potential to be an effective treatment option for osteomyelitis. Lefamulin has shown substantial tissue penetration and activity against the most common causative organism in all forms of osteomyelitis. We believe that based on the safety profile observed to date, lefamulin will be well tolerated for the long term use necessary for the treatment of both adult and pediatric patients with osteomyelitis. The current standard of care for these infections is treatment with vancomycin. We believe the ability to administer lefamulin by either the IV or oral route would provide a significant advantage over agents, such as vancomycin, that can only be administered by IV. 
 Prosthetic Joint Infections 
         Infection occurs in approximately 1% of joint replacement surgeries. Although the incidence of infection has been decreasing, the total number of replacement operations has been rising, such that, overall, there is increasing morbidity. The majority of these infections are caused by three organisms: coagulase negative staphylococci,  S. aureus (including MRSA) and streptococci, all organisms that are susceptible to lefamulin. The preferred treatment for joint infections with MRSA is vancomycin, with daptomycin and linezolid as alternatives. Vancomycin and daptomycin are administered only by IV for this indication, and linezolid has side effects that affect long term use. We believe that lefamulin could provide an alternative for both IV and oral therapy for these infections cases. 
         Although we have no current plans to develop lefamulin for indications other than CABP, we may advance these programs in the clinic based on available funding. 
   CONTEPO Clinical Development Program 
   Overview 
         CONTEPO is under development in the United States for the treatment of cUTI, including AP. The clinical development plan for CONTEPO utilized a modernized dosing regimen to optimize coverage of the predominant pathogens in hospital infections, including strains recognized by the CDC as an urgent or serious antibiotic resistant threat to public health in the United States. We submitted an NDA for marketing approval of CONTEPO for the treatment of cUTI in adults in the United States, to the FDA in October 2018. The NDA submission is utilizing the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway and is supported by a robust data package, including a pivotal Phase 2/3 clinical trial (known as

   ZEUS), which met its primary endpoint of statistical non-inferiority to piperacillin/tazobactam in patients with cUTI, including acute pyelonephritis. The FDA has granted us a PDUFA target action date of April 30, 2019 for CONTEPO. 
   Phase 2/3 Clinical Trial 
         The ZEUS Study was a multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, pivotal Phase 2/3 clinical trial designed to evaluate safety, tolerability, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of CONTEPO compared to PIP-TAZ in the treatment of hospitalized adults with cUTI or AP. PIP-TAZ is a combination antibiotic consisting of a broad-spectrum antibiotic, piperacillin, plus a Beta-lactamase inhibitor, tazobactam, which extends the antibiotic spectrum of piperacillin to include many Beta-lactamase-producing bacteria that have acquired resistance to piperacillin alone. PIP-TAZ is widely used to treat serious Gram-negative infections. The primary objective of the ZEUS Study was to demonstrate that CONTEPO was non-inferior to PIP-TAZ in overall success based on clinical cure and microbiologic eradication in the microbiologic modified intent-to-treat, or m-MITT, population at the test-of-cure visit, or TOC, which occurred on the 19th to 21st day after completion of seven days of treatment with the study drug, or after up to 14 days of treatment for patients with concurrent bacteremia. The m-MITT population consisted of 362 patients, each of whom met the study's inclusion criteria, was randomized, received any amount of study drug, and had one or more baseline Gram-negative pathogens growing at greater than or equal to 10(5) CFU/mL from an appropriately collected, pre-treatment baseline urine or blood sample. The primary endpoint was a composite of the investigator's determination of clinical cure, meaning complete resolution or significant improvement of signs and symptoms that were present at baseline and no new symptoms, such that no further antimicrobial therapy is warranted, plus microbiologic eradication, meaning that the baseline bacterial pathogen was reduced to less than 10(4) CFU/mL on urine culture and, if applicable, negative on repeat blood culture, both in the m-MITT population at TOC. Any missing or presumed eradications were classified as indeterminates, and conservatively counted as failures in the overall success analysis. 
         All pathogens isolated from patients who had a baseline and TOC pathogen underwent blinded, post-hoc, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, or PFGE, typing analysis. Microbiologic outcome was also defined utilizing the PFGE results, whereby microbiologic persistence required the same genus and species of baseline and post-baseline pathogens, as well as PFGE-confirmed genetic identity. 
         Patients eligible for the trial were required to be 18 years of age or older and have cUTI or AP that was considered by the clinical investigator to be serious enough to require hospitalization and IV antibiotic therapy. The diagnosis was based on pyuria, or the presence of pus or white blood cells in the urine, and cUTI or AP with at least two additional symptoms such as chills, rigors, or warmth associated with fever, nausea or vomiting, painful, difficult or frequent urination, lower abdominal or pelvic pain, or acute flank pain. Patients with cUTI were also required to have at least one risk factor, such as use of intermittent or indwelling bladder catheterization; functional or anatomical abnormality of the urogenital tract; complete or partial hindrance of normal urine flow; blood urea nitrogen greater than 20 mg/dL, blood urea greater than 42.8 mg/dL, or serum creatinine greater than 1.4 mg/dL, due to known prior renal disease; or, in male patients, chronic urinary retention. A baseline urine culture specimen was obtained within 48 hours prior to randomization, and any indwelling bladder catheters were required to be removed or replaced, unless such removal was considered unsafe or contraindicated, before or within 24 hours after randomization. 
         Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive either CONTEPO (6 grams IV fosfomycin) or PIP-TAZ (4 grams piperacillin/0.5 grams tazobactam) as one-hour infusions three times daily for seven days, except patients with concurrent bacteremia, who could have received treatment for up to 14 days at the clinical investigator's discretion. Oral step down therapy was prohibited. Throughout the study, all patients were monitored for signs and symptoms of cUTI or AP and the occurrence of adverse events. Laboratory data, including chemistry panels, complete blood counts, electrocardiograms, and 
 18

   samples for urine and blood cultures were collected from all patients at specified times throughout the study. 
         Of the total of 465 patients randomized across 92 sites in 16 countries, with studies conducted at 74 sites in 15 countries, 464 (99.8%) received at least one dose of the study drug. Of the 464 patients who received at least one dose of study drug, 233 patients were in the CONTEPO treatment group, and 231 patients were in the PIP-TAZ treatment group. The incidence of premature discontinuation from study drug was low and similar between treatment groups (6.0% in the CONTEPO treatment group compared to 3.9% in the PIP-TAZ treatment group), and the incidence of not completing the study through the last follow-up visit, or LFU, which occurred on the 24th through 28th day after completion of seven days of treatment with the study drug, or after up to 14 days of treatment for patients with concurrent bacteremia, was 5.2% in the CONTEPO group compared to 0.9% in the PIP-TAZ group. 
         In the ZEUS Study, CONTEPO was non-inferior to PIP-TAZ for the primary efficacy outcome of overall success, which was defined as clinical cure and microbiologic eradication at TOC. Overall success occurred in 64.7% of CONTEPO patients and 54.5% of PIP-TAZ patients. The treatment difference between the CONTEPO and PIP-TAZ groups was 10.2%, with a 95% confidence interval (0.4, 20.8). Additionally, the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval met the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 15%, demonstrating that CONTEPO was non-inferior to PIP-TAZ in the study. In a post-hoc primary efficacy analysis using results of blinded PFGE molecular typing of urinary tract pathogens, this difference was even greater (69.0% CONTEPO patients compared to 57.3% PIP-TAZ patients, with a treatment difference of 11.7%, with a 95% confidence interval (1.3, 22.1). Overall success rates were driven by microbiologic eradication rates, as clinical cure rates were greater than 90% and treatment differences were small at TOC. Using the PFGE molecular typing, the microbiologic eradication rates in the m-MITT population at the TOC were 70.7% for patients receiving CONTEPO compared to 60.1% for patients receiving PIP-TAZ. These rates were consistent with those observed in some contemporary cUTI studies, and most patients with microbiologic persistence at TOC had identifiable reasons or risk factors for persistence, such as functional or anatomical abnormalities of the urogenital tract, recent or indwelling urinary tract catheterization, elevated minimum inhibitory concentration, or MIC, to the study drug received, abbreviated study drug therapy, or other underlying co-morbidities. Of note, a majority of patients with microbiologic persistence at TOC were clinical cures at TOC, did not require rescue antimicrobial therapy, and remained sustained cures at LFU. 
         The identity and frequency of pathogens recovered at baseline from patients in the ZEUS Study were similar in both the CONTEPO and PIP-TAZ treatment groups. The most common pathogens identified were Enterobacteriaceae, identified in 96.2% of the CONTEPO patients and 94.9% of the PIP-TAZ patients, including E. coli, identified in 72.3% of the CONTEPO patients and 74.7% of the PIP-TAZ patients; K. pneumoniae, identified in 14.7% of the CONTEPO patients and 14.0% of the PIP-TAZ patients; Enterobacter cloacae species complex, identified in 4.9% of the CONTEPO patients and 1.7% of the PIP-TAZ patients; and Proteus mirabilis, identified in 4.9% of the CONTEPO patients and 2.8% of the PIP-TAZ patients. Gram-negative aerobes other than Enterobacteriaceae included Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which was identified in 4.3% of the CONTEPO patients and 5.1% of the PIP-TAZ patients, and Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus species complex, identified in 1.1% of the CONTEPO patients and no PIP-TAZ patients. These pathogens are representative of the pathogens that have been recovered in other studies of patients with cUTI or AP. For the predominant pathogens E. coli and K. pneumoniae, the clinical cure rates at TOC for CONTEPO were greater than 90% for both pathogens, and microbiologic eradication rates were 68.4%, or 72.9% with PFGE analysis, for E. coli, and 66.7% for K. pneumoniae on both a non-PFGE analysis and PFGE analysis-basis. 
         A total of 42.1% of CONTEPO patients and 32.0% of PIP-TAZ patients experienced at least one TEAE. Most TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity, and severe TEAEs were uncommon (2.1% of 
 19

   CONTEPO patients and 1.7% of PIP-TAZ patients). The most common TEAEs in both treatment groups were transient, asymptomatic laboratory abnormalities and gastrointestinal events. Treatment-emergent serious adverse events, or SAEs, were uncommon in both treatment groups (2.1% of CONTEPO patients and 2.6% of PIP-TAZ patients). There were no deaths in the study and one SAE in each treatment group was deemed related to the study drug (hypokalemia in a CONTEPO patient and renal impairment in a PIP-TAZ patient), leading to study drug discontinuation in the PIP-TAZ patient. Study drug discontinuations due to TEAEs were infrequent and similar between treatment groups (3.0% of CONTEPO patients and 2.6% of PIP-TAZ patients). 
         The most common laboratory abnormality TEAEs were increases in the levels of alanine aminotransferase (8.6% of CONTEPO patients and 2.6% of PIP-TAZ patients) and aspartate transaminase (7.3% of CONTEPO patients and 2.6% of PIP-TAZ patients). None of the aminotransferase elevations were symptomatic or treatment-limiting, and none of the patients met the criteria for Hy's Law. Outside of the United States, elevated liver aminotransferases are listed among undesirable effects in labeling for IV fosfomycin. 
         Hypokalemia occurred in 71 of 232 (30.6%) CONTEPO patients and 29 of 230 (12.6%) PIP-TAZ patients. Most decreases in potassium levels were mild to moderate in severity. Shifts in potassium levels from normal at baseline to hypokalemia, as determined by worst post-baseline hypokalemia values, were more frequent in the CONTEPO group than the PIP-TAZ group for mild (17.7% compared to 11.3%), moderate (11.2% compared to 0.9%), and severe (1.7% compared to 0.4%) categories of hypokalemia. Hypokalemia was deemed a TEAE in 6.4% of patients receiving CONTEPO and 1.3% of patients receiving PIP-TAZ, and all cases were transient and asymptomatic. While no significant cardiac adverse events were observed in the ZEUS Study, post-baseline QT intervals calculated using Fridericia's formula, or QTcF, of greater than 450 to less than or equal to 480 msec (baseline QTcF of less than or equal to 450 msec) occurred at a higher frequency in CONTEPO patients (7.3%) compared to PIP-TAZ patients (2.5%). In the CONTEPO arm, these results appear to be associated with the hypokalemia associated with the salt load of the IV formulation. 
   Phase 1 Pediatric Clinical Trial 
         In June 2018, we initiated a Phase 1, non-comparative, open-label study of the pharmacokinetics and safety of a single dose of CONTEPO in pediatric subjects less than 12 years of age receiving standard-of-care antibiotic therapy for proven or suspected infection or peri-operative prophylaxis. A total of 24 patients are expected to be enrolled at up to ten clinical sites in the United States. We anticipate completing enrollment in this trial in late 2020. 
   Potential Additional Indications for CONTEPO 
         Fosfomycin has a long history of use outside the United States in a variety of indications beyond cUTI. The FDA has granted both Fast Track and QIDP designations for the investigation of CONTEPO for the following indications in addition to cUTI:
 

 Complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) 
 Hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP) 
 Ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP) 
 Acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) 

         Although we have no current plans to develop CONTEPO for indications other than cUTI, including AP, these designations make CONTEPO eligible for Fast Track and GAIN incentives. We may advance these programs in the clinic based on available non-dilutive funding. 
 20

           In August 2017, Zavante entered into an agreement with the United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or NIAID, under which NIAID will conduct a clinical trial to assess CONTEPO's intrapulmonary penetration and pharmacokinetics in support of the product candidate's potential future development as a treatment for HABP and VABP. This bronchoalveolar lavage study, or the BAL study, will measure CONTEPO's pulmonary penetration by assessing drug concentrations in the lining of study subjects' bronchial pathways. Diffusion and saturation of antibiotics in patients' airways are considered important factors in assessing a drug's ability to effectively treat lower-respiratory tract infections. Prior preclinical and clinical investigations of IV fosfomycin have demonstrated that the product candidate penetrates rapidly into tissues and achieves clinically relevant concentrations in urine, soft tissues, lungs and other organs, supporting CONTEPO's potential versatility as an antibiotic treatment option. The protocol for the BAL study is currently under development in conjunction with NIAID, and we anticipate that the study will be initiated in mid-2019. 
   License Agreement with Sinovant Sciences 
         In March 2018, we entered into a license agreement, or the License Agreement, with Sinovant Sciences, Ltd. or Sinovant, an affiliate of Roivant Sciences, Ltd., to develop and commercialize lefamulin in the greater China region. As part of the License Agreement, Nabriva Therapeutics Ireland DAC and Nabriva Therapeutics GmbH, our wholly owned subsidiaries, granted Sinovant an exclusive license to develop and commercialize, and a non-exclusive license to manufacture, certain products containing lefamulin, or the Licensed Products, in the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan (together the "Territory"). We retain development and commercialization rights in the rest of the world. 
         Under the License Agreement, Sinovant and our subsidiaries established a joint development committee, or the JDC, to review and oversee development and commercialization plans in the Territory. We received a $5.0 million upfront payment pursuant to the terms of the License Agreement and are eligible for up to an additional $91.5 million in milestone payments upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestone events related to lefamulin for CABP, plus an additional $4.0 million in milestone payments if any Licensed Product receives a second or any subsequent regulatory approval in the People's Republic of China. The first milestone was a $1.5 million payment for the submission of a clinical trial application by Sinovant to the Chinese Food and Drug Administration that was received in February 2019. The remaining milestone payments are tied to additional regulatory approvals and annual sales targets. In addition, we will be eligible to receive low double-digit royalties on sales, if any, of Licensed Products in the Territory. 
         Sinovant will be solely responsible for all costs related to developing, obtaining regulatory approval of and commercializing Licensed Products in the Territory and is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and commercialize Licensed Product in the Territory. We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to supply, pursuant to supply agreements to be negotiated by the parties, to Sinovant sufficient supply of lefamulin for Sinovant to manufacture finished drug products for development and commercialization of the Licensed Products in the Territory. 
         Unless earlier terminated, the License Agreement will expire upon the expiration of the last royalty term for the last Licensed Product in the Territory, which we expect will occur in 2033. Following the expiration of the last royalty term, the license granted to Sinovant will become non-exclusive, fully-paid, royalty-free and irrevocable. The License Agreement may be terminated in its entirety by Sinovant upon 180 days' prior written notice at any time. Either party may, subject to specified cure periods, terminate the License Agreement in the event of the other party's uncured material breach. Either party may also terminate the License Agreement under specified circumstances relating to the other party's insolvency. We have the right to terminate the License Agreement immediately if Sinovant does not reach certain development milestones by certain specified dates 
 21

   (subject to specified cure periods). The License Agreement contemplates that the we will enter into ancillary agreements with Sinovant, including clinical and commercial supply agreements and a pharmacovigilance agreement. 
   Commercialization Strategy 
         Other than in greater China where we have licensed development and commercialization rights to lefamulin, we own exclusive, worldwide rights to lefamulin and U.S. rights to CONTEPO. We expect that our initial target population for lefamulin will consist of patients with moderate to severe CABP whose antibiotic treatment is hospital-initiated. If lefamulin receives marketing approval from the FDA for the treatment of CABP, we plan to pursue commercialization strategies that maximize the value of lefamulin in the United States with our own targeted hospital sales and marketing organization that we plan to expand beyond its current levels. Based on our market research, we believe lefamulin has an innovative profile supporting adoption in the United States for adult hospital- initiated CABP patients, treated both as in-patients as well as outpatient-transition of care from the hospital to the community, which we believe represents a significant commercial opportunity. We believe that we will be able to effectively communicate lefamulin's differentiating characteristics and key attributes to clinicians, hospital pharmacies and payors with the goal of establishing favorable reimbursement for outpatients as well as a favorable formulary status in targeted hospitals. Additionally, we believe that our plans for an initial targeted hospital-focused sales force should allow us to addresson our ownthe hospital-initiated treatment market for CABP in the United States in an efficient and effective way. There is also a significant opportunity for lefamulin to be used in the community for CABP patients, given its versatile profile, and this may represent a future expanded use. We plan to continue our pre-commercialization activities to prepare for a potential commercial launch of lefamulin, subject to receiving marketing approval in the United States. Outside of the United States, we expect to utilize a variety of types of collaboration, distribution and other marketing arrangements with one or more third parties to commercialize lefamulin. 
         Along with additional market research, we believe that medical education will be a key component of our commercialization efforts and, following potential commercial launch, plan to invest in these activities to optimize the commercial potential of lefamulin. With a targeted initial prescribing base predominantly in the hospital setting, we expect that a targeted hospital sales and marketing organization would be relatively smaller than competitors who are focused on both the hospital and community prescribing base. We believe that lefamulin's novel mechanism of action, status as the only member of a new class of systemically administered pleuromutilins and anticipated clinical profile will support its potential favorable reimbursement, its potential inclusion on formularies and in local and national treatment guidelines, subject to and following marketing approval. 
         We plan to evaluate the merits of entering into collaboration agreements with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies that may contribute to our ability to efficiently advance our product candidates, build our product pipeline and concurrently advance a range of research and development programs for a variety of indications outside the United States. 
         We own exclusive U.S. rights to CONTEPO. Our strategic intention, supported by CONTEPO's differentiated profile, is to establish CONTEPO as the standard of care in the United States for hospitalized patients with serious infections caused by suspected or confirmed MDR bacteria. We plan to use a targeted sales force to promote CONTEPO to hospital-based healthcare professionals in key locations within the United States where MDR infections, including CRE, are concentrated. These include roughly 900 hospitals in high resistance locations such as New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago, and other major population centers. 
         We currently have a team of regional business directors and medical science liaisons in the field performing educational and market development activities, respectively, for lefamulin and CONTEPO. 
 22

   We initially plan to use a targeted hospital-based sales force to promote both lefamulin formulations and CONTEPO, if approved. 
   Manufacturing 
         We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of lefamulin, CONTEPO, or any of the other compounds that we are evaluating in our discovery program. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of lefamulin, CONTEPO and any further products that we may develop. We have significant in-house knowledge and experience in (i) the relevant chemistry associated with our product candidates; and (ii) the relevant manufacturing and supply chain processes associated with the commercial supply of our product candidates. In addition to these internal resources, we engage third-party consultants, to assist in the management of our third-party manufacturers. 
         We have engaged a limited number of third-party manufacturers to provide all of our starting materials, drug substance and finished product for use in clinical trials. The active pharmaceutical ingredients, or API, and drug products have been produced under master service contracts and specific work orders from these manufacturers pursuant to agreements that include specific supply timelines and volume and quality expectations. We choose the third-party manufacturers of the drug substance based on the volume required and the regulatory requirements at the relevant stage of development. All lots of drug substance and drug products used in clinical trials are manufactured under current good manufacturing practices. Separate third-party manufacturers have been responsible for fill and finish services, and for labeling and shipment of the final drug product to the clinical trial sites. 
   Lefamulin 
         We have entered into a long-term commercial supply agreement with SEL Biochem Xinjiang Co., Ltd, or SEL, and Fountain International Development Holding Limited for the supply of pleuromutilin, which is the key intermediate for lefamulin API production. Under this agreement, SEL is required to manufacture and supply and we are required to purchase from SEL a specified percentage of our commercial requirements of pleuromutilin. The agreement expires on August 28, 2022, subject to automatic renewal for successive three-year periods. Either party may elect not to renew the agreement by providing two-year prior written notice before the end of the initial term or the then-current renewal term. Either party may terminate the agreement for the other party's uncured material breach or upon the occurrence of specified bankruptcy events. 
         The agreement includes customary supply terms, including product specifications, price, payment terms, requirements forecasting, delivery mechanics and quality assurance. Under the agreement, we have also negotiated a quality technical agreement pursuant to which SEL will conduct all quality control and release testing for the pleuromutilin produced under the agreement. 
         In November 2018 we entered into a long-term commercial supply agreement with Arran Chemical Company Limited, or Arran, for the supply of the chiral acid starting material required in the synthesis of lefamulin API. Under this agreement Arran is required to manufacture and supply, and we are required to purchase from Arran the amount forecast for the first six months of a twelve-month rolling forecast provided monthly by us. The agreement term expires on November 12, 2023 and continues thereafter unless terminated by either party with not less than twelve months written notice. Either party may terminate the agreement for the other party's uncured material breach or upon the occurrence of insolvency or bankruptcy events. The agreement includes customary supply terms including material specifications, price, payment terms, demand forecasting, delivery mechanics, and quality assurance. 
 23

           We have entered into a long-term commercial supply agreement with Hovione Limited, or Hovione, for the supply of lefamulin API. Under this agreement, Hovione is required to manufacture and supply and we are required to purchase from Hovione a specified percentage of our commercial requirements of lefamulin API. The agreement expires on November 22, 2025, subject to automatic renewal for successive two-year periods. Either party may elect not to renew the agreement by providing two-year prior written notice before the end of the initial term or the then-current renewal term. Either party may terminate the agreement for the other party's uncured material breach or upon the occurrence of specified bankruptcy events. 
         The agreement includes customary supply terms, including product specifications, price, payment terms, requirements forecasting, delivery mechanics and quality assurance. We are required to purchase a minimum of 750 kg to 1,500 kg per year of lefamulin API dependent on potential regulatory approval timing. Under the agreement, we have also negotiated a quality technical agreement pursuant to which Hovione will conduct all quality control and release testing for the pleuromutilin produced under the agreement. 
         We have also entered into a long-term commercial supply agreement with Patheon UK Limited, or Patheon, for the supply of IV vials of lefamulin. Under this agreement, Patheon is required to supply and we are required to purchase a specified percentage of our commercial requirements of IV vials of lefamulin. The agreement expires on December 31, 2023, subject to automatic renewal for successive two-year periods. Either party may elect not to renew the agreement by providing two-year prior written notice before the end of the initial term, and after the initial term, either party may terminate the agreement with 24-months prior written notice at any time. Either party may also terminate the agreement for the other party's uncured material breach or upon the occurrence of specified bankruptcy events. We may also terminate the agreement if a governmental authority takes action that prevents us from importing, exporting, purchasing or selling the IV vials of lefamulin. Finally, Patheon may terminate the agreement if we assign any of our rights under the agreement to an assignee that it does not consider to be a creditworthy substitute or is a competitor of Patheon. 
         The agreement includes customary supply terms, including product specifications, batch size requirements, price, payment terms, requirements forecasting, delivery mechanics and quality assurance. Under the agreement, we have also negotiated a quality agreement pursuant to which Patheon will conduct all quality control testing for the IV vials of lefamulin. 
         In addition, we have entered into a long-term commercial supply agreement with Almac Pharma Services Limited, or Almac, for the commercial supply of lefamulin tablets. Under this agreement, Almac is required to supply and we are required to purchase services relating to the manufactured tablets equaling a specified minimum annual spend. The initial term of the agreement expires on August 7, 2022, but it will remain in force until it is terminated by either party with 24-months prior written notice, expiring on or at any time after the expiry of the initial term. Either party may also terminate the agreement for the other party's uncured material breach or upon the occurrence of specified bankruptcy events. The agreement includes customary supply terms, including payment terms, requirements forecasting, delivery mechanics and quality assurance. Under the agreement, we have also negotiated a quality technical agreement pursuant to which Almac will conduct all quality control testing for the tablets. 
         In August 2018, we entered into a commercial packaging and supply agreement, or the Packaging Agreement with Sharp Corporation, or Sharp, for the commercial packaging of lefamulin acetate for oral and intravenous administration. Under the Packaging Agreement, Sharp has agreed to provide certain packaging services to us, including labeling, serialization and final packaging of the packaged products. 
         The Packaging Agreement has an initial five-year term ending December 31, 2023 and will automatically renew after the initial term for additional one-year terms unless either party gives notice 
 24

   of its intention to terminate the Packaging Agreement at least 90 days prior to the end of the then-current term. In addition, either party may terminate the Packaging Agreement for the other party's uncured material breach, in addition to other specified events, including with respect to bankruptcy proceedings and governmental actions, in each case subject to notice, cure periods and other conditions set forth in the Packaging Agreement. 
         The Packaging Agreement includes customary supply terms, including product specifications, batch size requirements, price, payment terms, requirements forecasting, delivery mechanics and quality assurance. Under the agreement, we have also negotiated a quality agreement pursuant to which Sharp will conduct quality control testing for the packaged products. 
         These six commercial supply agreements relating to lefamulin are filed as exhibits to this Form 10-K. Other than these six agreements, we do not have long-term agreements with any other third parties for the manufacture of commercial supplies of lefamulin, but we intend to enter into additional agreements with third-party contract manufacturers for additional commercial supplies of lefamulin pending potential regulatory approval. 
         Lefamulin is a semi-synthetic organic compound of low molecular weight. The pleuromutilin core of the molecule is produced by fermentation and is manufactured on a significant scale by various manufacturers. The second part of the molecule is established from a readily accessible chiral starting material. We have selected the lefamulin based on its efficacy and safety profile, although it is also associated with reasonable cost of goods, ready availability of starting materials and ease of synthesis. The development stage production of lefamulin was carried out at a significant scale and we believe, if required, the synthetic route to lefamulin is amenable to further scale-up. The synthetic route does not require unusual, or specialized, equipment in the manufacturing process. Therefore, if any of our current or future drug substance manufacturers were to become unavailable for any reason, we believe there are a number of potential replacements, although delays may be incurred in identifying and qualifying such replacements. 
 


CONTEPO 

         Effective July 28, 2016, Zavante, Laboratorios ERN, S.A. ("ERN") and Ercros, S.A. ("Ercros") entered into an amended and restated three-way agreement (the "Three-Way Agreement"), which established the basis for related supply agreements with ERN and Ercros in anticipation of FDA approval of fosfomycin disodium and succinic acid injection for intravenous use filled, finished and packaged into containers for use by end users ("Product") in the United States. Pursuant to the Three-Way Agreement, Zavante has the direct responsibility for the manufacture and supply of the commercial Product in the United States. 
         Under the Three-Way Agreement, (i) ERN has agreed to provide Zavante with certain technical documentation (Technical Documentation") and data required for submission of an NDA or Abbreviated New Drug Application("ANDA"), as applicable, for the Product , and other assistance in connection with the submission of an NDA or ANDA, pursuant to the ERN Supply Agreement (as defined below); (ii) Ercros has agreed to provide Zavante with certain Technical Documentation and the manufacture and supply of a blend of fosfomycin disodium and succinic acid (the "API Mixture") for the manufacture of the Product, pursuant to the terms of the Ercros Supply Agreement (as defined below); and (iii) Zavante has agreed to obtain the commercial supply of the Product, under one or more separate agreements with third party manufacturers. The rights and obligations of each of the parties are set forth in each of the ERN Supply Agreement and the Ercros Supply Agreement. 
         In addition, pursuant to the Three-Way Agreement, Zavante is required to (i) contract with one or more third party manufacturers to provide quantities of the Product required by Zavante for commercial sale in the United States, perform validation activities as required by the FDA, and obtain FDA approval of such third party manufacturer's facilities and quality systems; (ii) use commercially

         The Three-Way-Agreement will continue in force and effect until the Ercros Supply Agreement and the ERN Supply Agreement have both been terminated or expired in accordance with the respective terms therein, or if the Three-Way Agreement is terminated upon mutual written agreement of all of the parties. The Three-Way Agreement contains, among other provisions, customary provisions relating to legal compliance and publicity. 
         Effective July 28, 2016, Zavante and Ercros entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement (the "Ercros Supply Agreement") pursuant to the Three-Way Agreement. Under the Ercros Supply Agreement, Ercros has agreed, pursuant to purchase orders entered into under the Ercros Supply Agreement, to manufacture (i) the exclusive supply of the API Mixture for Zavante in support of filing an NDA or an ANDA, as applicable, and (ii) the commercial supply of fosfomycin disodium and succinic acid injection for intravenous use in the United States. In addition, Ercros has agreed to provide access to certain technical documentation as may be requested by Zavante in connection with the filing of an NDA. 
         The Ercros Supply Agreement has an initial ten-year term ending July 28, 2026 and will automatically renew after the initial term for additional two-year terms unless either party gives notice of its intention to terminate the Ercros Supply Agreement at least 18 months prior to the end of the then-current term. Either party may terminate the Ercros Supply Agreement for the other party's uncured material breach, in addition to other specified events, including with respect to bankruptcy proceedings, governmental actions and legal proceedings, in each case subject to notice, cure periods and other conditions set forth in the Ercros Supply Agreement. 
         The Ercros Supply Agreement contains customary supply terms, including requirements forecasting, purchase orders, product specifications, price, payment terms, delivery mechanics and quality insurance. In addition, the Ercros Supply Agreement contains, among other provisions, customary representations and warranties by the parties, a grant by Ercros to Zavante of certain limited license rights to Ercros' intellectual property in connection with Zavante's performance under the Ercros Supply Agreement, certain indemnification rights in favor of both parties and customary confidentiality provisions. 
         Under the Ercros Supply Agreement, Zavante and Ercros have also entered into a quality agreement, pursuant to which Ercros will conduct all quality control and release testing for the API Mixture produced under the Ercros Supply Agreement. 
         Effective July 28, 2016, Zavante and ERN entered into an amended and restated pharmaceutical manufacturing and exclusive supply agreement, as amended on December 1, 2016, March 1, 2017, May 1, 2017 and December 20, 2017, pursuant to the Three-Way Agreement (the ERN Supply Agreement). Under the ERN Supply Agreement, each party is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete certain development activities required for submission of an NDA or an ANDA for fosfomycin sodium and succinic acid (the bulk formulation of CONTEPO). In addition, ERN has agreed to provide to Zavante (i) certain technical documentation and data as required by the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use's guidelines and the FDA for submission of an NDA or an ANDA for the bulk formulation of CONTEPO, and (ii) certain regulatory support in connection with the bulk formulation of CONTEPO sold or intended for commercial sale and human use. 
 26

          
        Upon the first commercial sale of the bulk formulation of CONTEPO, Zavante is obligated to make a one-time cash payment to ERN and subsequent quarterly payments thereafter based on the number of vials of the bulk formulation of CONTEPO sold during each calendar quarter. 
         The ERN Supply Agreement has an initial ten-year term ending July 28, 2026 and will automatically renew after the initial term for additional two-year terms unless either party gives notice of its intention to terminate the ERN Supply Agreement at least 18 months prior to the end of the then-current term. Either party may terminate the ERN Supply Agreement by mutual written agreement and for the other party's uncured material breach, in addition to other specified events, including with respect to bankruptcy proceedings and governmental actions, in each case subject to notice, cure periods and other conditions set forth in the ERN Supply Agreement. 
         The ERN Supply Agreement contains, among other provisions, customary representations and warranties by the parties, a grant to each party by the other party of certain limited license rights to such other party's intellectual property in connection with the parties' performance of the services under the ERN Supply Agreement, certain indemnification rights in favor of both parties and customary confidentiality provisions. 
         On April 25, 2017, Zavante and Fisiopharma, S.r.l. ("Fisiopharma") entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement, as amended on May 8, 2017 (the "Fisiopharma Supply Agreement"). Under the Fisiopharma Supply Agreement, Fisiopharma has agreed, pursuant to purchase orders entered into under the Fisiopharma Supply Agreement, to manufacture and supply fosfomycin disodium for intravenous injection in bulk drug vials (the "Bulk Drug Vials") to Zavante in support of filing an NDA or an ANDA, as applicable, and a specified percentage of Zavante's commercial requirements of Bulk Drug Vials for the United States. 
         The Fisiopharma Supply Agreement has an initial ten-year term ending April 25, 2027 and will automatically renew after the initial term for additional one-year terms unless Zavante gives notice of its intention to terminate the Fisiopharma Supply Agreement at least six months prior to the end of the then-current term. Either party may terminate the Fisiopharma Supply Agreement for the other party's uncured material breach or upon the occurrence of specified bankruptcy events, and Zavante may terminate the Fisiopharma Supply Agreement upon the occurrence of other specified events, including with respect to governmental actions and legal proceedings instituted against Fisiopharma, in each case subject to notice, cure periods and other conditions set forth in the Fisiopharma Supply Agreement. 
         The Fisiopharma Supply Agreement contains customary supply terms, including requirements forecasting, purchase orders, product specifications, price, payment terms, delivery mechanics and quality insurance. In addition, it contains, among other provisions, customary representations and warranties by the parties, a grant to Fisiopharma of certain limited license rights of Zavante's intellectual property in connection with Fisiopharma's performance of services under the Fisiopharma Supply Agreement, certain indemnification rights in favor of both parties, limitations of liability and customary confidentiality provisions. 
         Under the Fisiopharma Supply Agreement, Zavante and Fisiopharma have also entered into a quality control agreement, pursuant to which Fisiopharma will conduct all quality control and release testing for the bulk drug vials produced under the Fisiopharma Supply Agreement. Any default under the quality control agreement constitutes a default under the Ercros Supply Agreement. 
         On December 26, 2017, Zavante entered into a commercial packaging agreement (the "PCI Packaging Agreement") with AndersonBrecon Inc., doing business as PCI of Illinois ("PCI") for the commercial packaging of fosfomycin disodium for intravenous injection in bulk drug vials (the "Packaged Product"). Under the PCI Packaging Agreement, PCI has agreed to provide certain packaging services to Zavante, including labeling, serialization and final packaging of the PCI Packaged Product. 
 27

           The PCI Packaging Agreement has an initial three-year term ending December 26, 2020 and will automatically renew after the initial term for additional one-year terms unless either party gives notice of its intention to terminate the PCI Packaging Agreement at least 120 days prior to the end of the then-current term. In addition, either party may terminate the PCI Packaging Agreement for the other party's uncured material breach, in addition to other specified events, including with respect to bankruptcy proceedings and governmental actions, in each case subject to notice, cure periods and other conditions set forth in the PCI Packaging Agreement. 
         The PCI Packaging Agreement contains customary supply terms, including product specifications, price, payment terms, delivery mechanics and quality insurance. In addition, it contains, among other provisions, customary representations and warranties by the parties, a grant to PCI of certain limited license rights of Zavante's intellectual property in connection with PCI's performance of services under the PCI Packaging Agreement certain indemnification rights in favor of both parties, limitations of liability and customary confidentiality provisions. 
         Under the PCI Packaging Agreement, Zavante and PCI have also entered into a contract services quality agreement, which governs the responsibilities of each party regarding the quality aspects of packaging and release of PCI Packaged Product. 
         These five commercial supply agreements relating to CONTEPO are filed as exhibits to this Form 10-K. Other than these five agreements, we do not have long-term agreements with any other third parties for the manufacture of commercial supplies of CONTEPO, but we intend to enter into additional agreements with third-party contract manufacturers for additional commercial supplies of CONTEPO pending potential regulatory approval. 
   Competition 
         The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technologies, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
         Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 
         Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain marketing approvals for their products more rapidly than we obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected because in some cases insurers or other third-party payors seek to encourage the use of generic products. This may have the effect of making branded products less attractive, from a cost perspective, to buyers. We expect that if lefamulin is 
 28

   approved for CABP, it will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products. This may make it difficult for us to replace existing therapies with lefamulin. 
         The key competitive factors affecting the success of our product candidates are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 
         There are a variety of available therapies marketed for the treatment of CABP. Currently, the treatment of CABP is dominated by generic products. For hospitalized patients, combination therapy is frequently used. Many currently approved drugs are well-established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payors. We also are aware of various drugs under development for the treatment of CABP, including omadacycline which was launched in February 2019 by Paratek Pharmaceuticals Inc., delafloxacin which was approved by the FDA in June 2017 for ABSSSI, and is marketed by Melinta Therapeutics Inc. which also have an ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial of delafloxacin for CABP and oral nafithromycin which is in Phase 2 clinical development by Wockhardt Ltd. 
         If approved, we expect CONTEPO will face competition from commercially available antibiotics such as ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, tigecycline, plazomicin, from other product candidates currently in development for the treatment of cUTI, including AP, such as imipenem-relebactam (under Phase 3 clinical development by Merck), cefiderocol (under Phase 3 clinical development by Shionogi), ETX0282-cefpodoxime proxetil (under development by Entasis Therapeutics), and LYS228 (under development by Boston Pharma), as well as generically available agents including carbapenems, aminoglycosides, and polymyxins. 
   Intellectual Property 
         Our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business by, among other methods, seeking and maintaining patents, where available, that are intended to cover our product candidates, compositions and formulations, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture and any other inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary and competitive position. 
         As of January 31, 2019, we owned 22 different families of patents and patent applications, including 21 families directed to the various pleuromutilin derivatives as compositions of matter, processes for their manufacture, and their use in pharmaceutical compositions and methods of treating disease. The remaining family is directed to ß-lactamase inhibitors. Our patent portfolio includes 23 issued U.S. patents, 23 granted European patents and 18 granted Japanese patents, as well as patents in other jurisdictions. We also have pending patent applications in the United States, Europe, Japan and other countries and regions, including Asia, Australia, Eastern Europe, and South America, including notably Canada, Brazil, China, Israel, India and Taiwan among others. 
         All of these patents and patent applications are assigned solely to us and were either originally filed by us or originally filed by Sandoz and subsequently assigned to us. 
         As of January 31, 2019, our lead product candidate, lefamulin, was protected by the following seven patent families:
 

 The first patent family includes patents and applications with claims directed to generic classes of compounds that include lefamulin and/or
their use in the treatment of microbial infections. This family includes issued patents in the United States, Europe and Japan, as well as issued patents in 11 other jurisdictions. The standard term
for patents in this family expires in 2021. 

 29

   

 The second patent family includes patents and applications with claims that specifically recite lefamulin and/or its use in the treatment of
microbial infections. This family includes two issued patents in each of the United States, Europe and Japan, as well as issued patents in 21 other jurisdictions and 5 pending patent applications in
other jurisdictions, including one divisional application in the United States. The standard term for patents in this family expires in 2028. A patent term adjustment of 303 days has already
been obtained in the United States for one patent. 
 The third patent family includes patents and applications with claims directed to the processes for the manufacture of lefamulin, crystalline
intermediates useful in the processes, and the resulting crystalline salts. This family includes 16 granted patents including issued patents in the United States, Europe and Japan and 13 pending
patent applications one each in Europe and Japan and 13 in other jurisdictions. The standard term for patents in this family expires in 2031. 
 The fourth patent family includes patents and applications with claims directed to processes for the synthetic manufacture of crystalline
intermediates useful in the manufacture of lefamulin. This family includes granted patents in Europe, the United States and Japan and granted patents in other jurisdictions and further pending
applications. The standard term for patents in this family expires in 2031. 
 The fifth patent family includes patents and applications with claims directed to pharmaceuticals and treatments for Helicobacter
infection, including pleuromutilins, such as lefamulin. This family includes issued patents in the United States, Europe and one other
jurisdiction. The standard term for patents in this family expires in 2023. A patent term adjustment of 921 days has already been obtained for the U.S. patent. 
 A further patent family is directed to pharmaceutical compositions of lefamulin and covers 17 pending patent applications in various
jurisdictions. 
 The seventh patent family covers methods for purification of pleuromutilins and the PCT-application was recently published. 

         Our second most advanced product candidate, BC-7013, is covered specifically in one patent family with patents granted in the United States, Europe and Japan, as well as nine other jurisdictions, and pending patent applications in other jurisdictions. The standard term for patents in this family expires in 2027. 
         The remaining 13 pleuromutilin patent families are directed to either molecules in the intellectual property landscape surrounding our product candidates in development or molecules which can be potentially further developed by us but have not yet been pursued. All patent applications in these families have been filed at least in the United States and Europe, and most have been filed in other countries. The majority of these patent applications have already resulted in granted patents. 
         Finally, we own one patent family directed to ß-lactamase inhibitor compounds. Patent applications in this family have been filed and granted in the United States and Europe. The standard term for patents in this family expires in 2030. 
         Zavante holds one issued United States patent (U.S. 9,345,717) directed to methods for identifying dosing regimens that decrease the potential for on-therapy drug resistance. Additionally, Zavante has filed a patent application based on results from the ZEUS Study that relates to methods for treating patients with resistant bacterial infections and, specifically, Gram-negative bacterial infections. However, this patent may not ensure exclusivity through the patent term and we may not be able to secure any additional patent protection. We plan to rely on regulatory protection afforded to CONTEPO through orphan drug designations, data exclusivity, and market exclusivity where available. 
 30

           The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent's term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. The term of a U.S. patent that covers a drug, biological product or medical device approved pursuant to a pre-market approval, or PMA, may also be eligible for patent term extension when FDA approval is granted, provided that certain statutory and regulatory requirements are met. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review while the patent is in force. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration date set for the patent. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to each regulatory review period may be granted an extension and only those claims reading on the approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug, provided that statutory and regulatory requirements are met. Thus, in the future, if and when our product candidates receive approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those products, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each drug and other factors. The expiration dates of our patents and patent applications referred to above are without regard to potential patent term extension or other market exclusivity that may be available to us. 
         In addition to patents, we may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology and maintain our competitive position. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, corporate and scientific collaborators, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and other third parties. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. 
   Government Regulation 
         Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, pricing, reimbursement, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
   Review and Approval of Drugs in the United States 
         In the United States, the FDA reviews, approves and regulates drugs under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and associated implementing regulations. The failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-approval may result in delays to the conduct of study, regulatory review and subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, adverse publicity, injunctions, fines, refusals of government 
 31

   contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, and civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, or other governmental entities, including state agencies. 
         An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug product in the United States must typically undertake the following before a product candidate will be approved by the FDA:
 

 completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA's good laboratory practice, or
GLP, regulations; 
 submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin; 
 approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated; 
 performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety
and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication; 
 preparation and submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA, summarizing available data to support the proposed approval of the new
drug product for the proposed use; 
 review of the product application by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable and as may be requested by the FDA; 
 satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof,
are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product's
identity, strength, quality and purity; 
 satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data; 
 payment of PDUFA fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA; and 
 compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or
REMS, where applicable, and the potential to conduct post-approval studies required by the FDA. 

 Preclinical Studies 
         Before an applicant begins testing a compound with potential therapeutic value in humans, the drug candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the purity and stability of the manufactured drug substance or active pharmaceutical ingredient and the formulated drug or drug product, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the safety and activity of the drug for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Additional long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. 
         Companies usually must complete some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of long term exposure and reproductive adverse events, and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the investigational product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The 
 32

   manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the candidate product and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the candidate product does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
   The IND and IRB Processes 
         An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved drug to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer an investigational drug to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any new drug that is not the subject of an approved NDA. In support of a request for an IND, applicants must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin. This waiting period is designed to allow the FDA to review the IND to determine whether human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. At any time during this 30-day period, the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold or partial clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. 
         Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on that trial. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a specific protocol or part of a protocol is not allowed to proceed, while other protocols may do so. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation may only resume after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed. 
         A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When the foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with FDA certain regulatory requirements in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Specifically, on April 28, 2008, the FDA amended its regulations governing the acceptance of foreign clinical studies not conducted under an investigational new drug application as support for an IND or a new drug application. The final rule provides that such studies must be conducted in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee, or IEC, and informed consent from subjects. The GCP requirements in the final rule encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical studies. The FDA's regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical studies, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. They further help ensure that non-IND foreign studies are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for IND studies. 
         In addition to the foregoing IND requirements, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The 
 33

   IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
         Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee, or DSMB. This group provides authorization as to whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on unblinded safety data from the study to which only the DSMB has access. Suspension or termination of development during any phase of clinical trials may occur if it is determined that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Other reasons for suspension or termination may be made by us based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. 
         Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website. 
   Human Clinical Studies in Support of an NDA 
         Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. 
         Human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following four sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
 

 Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or, in certain indications such as cancer, patients with the
target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness and to determine
optimal dosage. 
 Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to
preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 
 Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in
well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and
to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. 
 Phase 4: Post-approval studies, which are conducted following initial approval, are typically conducted to gain additional experience
and data from treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. 

         Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or 
 34

   the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted. 
         Concurrent with clinical trials, companies often complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
         Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. With enactment of the Food and Drug Safety and Innovation Act, or the FDASIA, in 2012, sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA's internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time. For drugs intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, the FDA must, upon the request of an applicant, meet to discuss preparation of the initial pediatric study plan or to discuss deferral or waiver of pediatric assessments. 
         The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in FDASIA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation. 
 


Expanded Access to an Investigational Drug for Treatment Use 

         Expanded access, sometimes called "compassionate use," is the use of investigational new drug products outside of clinical trials to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. The rules and regulations related to expanded access are intended to improve access to investigational drugs for patients who may benefit from investigational therapies. FDA regulations allow access to investigational drugs under an IND by the company or the treating physician for treatment purposes on a case-by-case basis for: individual patients (single-patient IND applications for treatment in emergency settings and non-emergency settings); intermediate-size patient populations; and larger populations for use of the drug under a treatment protocol or Treatment IND Application. 
         When considering an IND application for expanded access to an investigational product with the purpose of treating a patient or a group of patients, the sponsor and treating physicians or investigators will determine suitability when all of the following criteria apply: patient(s) have a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition, and there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative 
 35

   therapy to diagnose, monitor, or treat the disease or condition; the potential patient benefit justifies the potential risks of the treatment and the potential risks are not unreasonable in the context or condition to be treated; and the expanded use of the investigational drug for the requested treatment will not interfere initiation, conduct, or completion of clinical investigations that could support marketing approval of the product or otherwise compromise the potential development of the product. 
         On December 13, 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act established (and the 2017 Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act later amended) a requirement that sponsors of one or more investigational drugs for the treatment of a serious disease(s) or condition(s) make publicly available their policy for evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access for individual patients. Although these requirements were rolled out over time, they have now come into full effect. This provision requires drug and biologic companies to make publicly available their policies for expanded access for individual patient access to products intended for serious diseases. Sponsors are required to make such policies publicly available upon the earlier of initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 study; or 15 days after the drug or biologic receives designation as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy. 
         In addition, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act, but the manufacturer must develop an internal policy and respond to patient requests according to that policy. 
   Special Protocol Assessment Agreements 
         A Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, agreement is an agreement between a drug manufacturer and the FDA on the design and size of studies and clinical trials that can be used for approval of a drug or biological product. The FDA's guidance on such agreements states that an agreement may not be changed by the manufacturer or the agency unless through a written agreement of the two entities or if FDA determines a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the drug. The protocols that are eligible for SPA agreements are: animal carcinogenicity protocols, final product stability protocols and clinical protocols for Phase 3 trials whose data will form the primary basis for an efficacy claim. 
         Specifically, under the FDCA, the FDA may meet with sponsors, provided certain conditions are met, for the purpose of reaching a SPA agreement on the design and size of clinical trials intended to form the primary basis of an efficacy claim in a marketing application. If a sponsor makes a reasonable written request to meet with the FDA for the purpose of reaching agreement on the design and size of a clinical trial, then the FDA will meet with the sponsor. If an agreement is reached, the FDA will reduce the agreement to writing and make it part of the administrative record. An agreement may not be changed by the sponsor or FDA after the trial begins, except with the written agreement of the sponsor and FDA, or if the director of the FDA reviewing division determines that "a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the drug" was identified after the testing began. If a sponsor and the FDA meet regarding the design and size of a clinical trial and the parties cannot agree that the trial design is adequate to meet the goals of the sponsor, the FDA will clearly state the reasons for the disagreement in a letter to the sponsor. We reached agreement with the FDA in September 2015 on a SPA regarding the study design of our first Phase 3 clinical trial of lefamulin for the treatment of CABP. 
 36

     Submission of an NDA to the FDA 
         Assuming successful completion of required clinical testing and other requirements, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product's chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is subject to an application user fee, which for federal fiscal year 2019 is $2,588,478 for an application requiring clinical data. The sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program fee, which for fiscal year 2019 is $309,154. Exceptions or waivers for these fees exist for a small company (fewer than 500 employees, including employees and affiliates) satisfying certain requirements and products with orphan drug designation for a particular indication are not subject to a fee provided there are no other intended uses in the NDA. 
         Following submission of an NDA, the FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA generally within 60 calendar days of its receipt and strives to inform the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA's receipt of the submission whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Standard review, representing most such applications are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date of filing. Priority review applications are meant to be reviewed within six months of filing. The review process and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal date may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission. Under the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, the FDA must implement a protocol to expedite review of responses to inspection reports pertaining to certain applications, including applications for products in shortage or those for which approval is dependent on remediation of conditions identified in the inspection report. 
         Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with an NDA submission, including drug component manufacturing (such as active pharmaceutical ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing, and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. 
         In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. REMS can include medication guides, physician communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU may include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The FDA may require a REMS before approval or post-approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a product. 
 37

           The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions relating to approval of a new drug product. 
   Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Priority Review and Regenerative Advanced Therapy Designations 
         The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs are referred to as fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review designation and regenerative advanced therapy designation. 
         Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for Fast Track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For Fast Track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product's application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a Fast Track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA's time period goal for reviewing a Fast Track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 
         Second, a product may be designated as a Breakthrough Therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to Breakthrough Therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner. 
         Third, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case- by-case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA's goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months. 
         With passage of the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, in December 2016, Congress authorized the FDA to accelerate review and approval of products designated as regenerative advanced therapies. A product is eligible for this designation if it is a regenerative medicine therapy that is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product has the potential to address unmet medical 
 38

   needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of a regenerative advanced therapy designation include early interactions with FDA to expedite development and review, benefits available to breakthrough therapies, potential eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints. 
   Accelerated Approval Pathway 
         The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a drug for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the drug has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a drug when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Drugs granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval. 
         For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a drug. 
         The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a drug, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of drugs for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit. The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor's agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the drug's clinical benefit. As a result, a drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. 
   Limited Population Antibacterial Drug Pathway 
         With passage of the CURES Act, Congress authorized FDA to approve an antibacterial or antifungal drug, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, as a "limited population drug." To qualify for this approval pathway, the drug must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening infection in a limited population of patients with unmet needs; the standards for approval of drugs and biologics under the FDCA and PHSA must be satisfied; and FDA must receive a written request from the sponsor to approve the drug as a limited population drug pursuant to this provision. The FDA's determination of safety and effectiveness for such a product must reflect the benefit-risk profile of such 
 39

   drug in the intended limited population, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the infection the drug is intended to treat and the availability or lack of alternative treatment in such a limited population. 
         Any drug or biologic approved under this pathway must be labeled with the statement "Limited Population" in a prominent manner and adjacent to the proprietary name of the drug or biological product. The prescribing information must also state that the drug is indicated for use in a limited and specific population of patients and copies of all promotional materials relating to the drug must be submitted to FDA at least 30 days prior to dissemination of the materials. If FDA subsequently approves the drug for a broader indication, the agency may remove any post-marketing conditions, including requirements with respect to labeling and review of promotional materials applicable to the product. Nothing in this pathway to approval of a limited population drug prevents sponsors of such products from seeking designation or approval under other provisions of the FDCA, such as accelerated approval. 
   The FDA's Decision on an NDA 
         On the basis of the FDA's evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require additional, sometimes substantial, testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA's satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
         If the FDA approves a new product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug's safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
   Post-Approval Regulation 
         Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with or without clinical data. 
         In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with 
 40

   cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
         Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 

 restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, suspension of the approval, or complete withdrawal of the product from the
market or product recalls; 
 fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 
 refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 
 product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 
 injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

         The FDA strictly regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of prescription drug products placed on the market. This regulation includes, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet and social media. Promotional claims about a drug's safety or effectiveness are prohibited before the drug is approved. After approval, a drug product generally may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA, as reflected in the product's prescribing information. In the United States, health care professionals are generally permitted to prescribe drugs for such uses not described in the drug's labeling, known as off-label uses, because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA regulations impose rigorous restrictions on manufacturers' communications and prohibit the promotion of off-label uses. It may be permissible, under very specific, narrow conditions, for a manufacturer to engage in non-promotional, non-misleading communication regarding off-label information, such as distributing scientific or medical journal information. 
         If a company is found to have promoted off-label uses, it may become subject to adverse public relations and administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion, and has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. 
 41

          
        In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, and its implementing regulations, as well as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCA, which regulate the distribution and tracing of prescription drug samples at the federal level, and set minimum standards for the regulation of drug distributors by the states. The PDMA, its implementing regulations and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and the DSCA imposes requirements to ensure accountability in distribution and to identify and remove counterfeit and other illegitimate products from the market. 
 


Section 505(b)(2) NDAs 

         NDAs for most new drug products are based on two full clinical studies which must contain substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy of the proposed new product for the proposed use. These applications are submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA. The FDA is, however, authorized to approve an alternative type of NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. This type of application allows the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA's previous findings of safety and efficacy for a similar product, or published literature. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) applies to NDAs for a drug for which the investigations made to show whether or not the drug is safe for use and effective in use and relied upon by the applicant for approval of the application "were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted." 
         Thus, Section 505(b)(2) authorizes the FDA to approve an NDA based on safety and effectiveness data that were not developed by the applicant. NDAs filed under Section 505(b)(2) may provide an alternate and potentially more expeditious pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. If the Section 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA's previous approval is scientifically appropriate, the applicant may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new drug candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 
   Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs 
         In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the statute. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference listed drug, or RLD. 
         Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is "bioequivalent" to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if "the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug." 
         Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is "therapeutically equivalent" to the RLD in its publication "Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations," also referred to as the "Orange Book." Physicians and pharmacists consider a therapeutic equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA's designation of therapeutic equivalence often 
 42

   results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient. 
         Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. For the purposes of this provision, a new chemical entity, or NCE, is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication. 
         The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication. Three-year exclusivity would be available for a drug product that contains a previously approved active moiety, provided the statutory requirement for a new clinical investigation is satisfied. Unlike five-year NCE exclusivity, an award of three-year exclusivity does not block the FDA from accepting ANDAs seeking approval for generic versions of the drug as of the date of approval of the original drug product. The FDA typically makes decisions about awards of data exclusivity shortly before a product is approved. 
         The FDA must establish a priority review track for certain generic drugs, requiring the FDA to review a drug application within eight (8) months for a drug that has three (3) or fewer approved drugs listed in the Orange Book and is no longer protected by any patent or regulatory exclusivities, or is on the FDA's drug shortage list. The new legislation also authorizes FDA to expedite review of "competitor generic therapies" or drugs with inadequate generic competition, including holding meetings with or providing advice to the drug sponsor prior to submission of the application. 
   Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30-Month Stay 
         Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant's product or an approved method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. 
         Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:
 

 the required patent information has not been filed; 
 the listed patent has expired; 

 43

   

 the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or 
 the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product. 

         A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product's listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired (other than method of use patents involving indications for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval). 
         If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 
         To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. As a result, approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 
   Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity 
         Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA's request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application. 
   GAIN Exclusivity for Antibiotics 
         In 2012, Congress passed legislation known as the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act, or GAIN Act. This legislation is designed to encourage the development of antibacterial and antifungal drug products that treat pathogens that cause serious and life-threatening infections. To that end, the law grants an additional five years of exclusivity upon the approval of an NDA for a drug product designated by FDA as a QIDP. Thus, for a QIDP, the periods of five-year new chemical entity exclusivity, three-year new clinical investigation exclusivity, and seven-year orphan drug exclusivity, would become ten years, eight years, and twelve years, respectively. 
 44

           A QIDP is defined in the GAIN Act to mean "an antibacterial or antifungal drug for human use intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections, including those caused by (1) an antibacterial or antifungal resistant pathogen, including novel or emerging infectious pathogens" or (2) certain "qualifying pathogens." A "qualifying pathogen" is a pathogen that has the potential to pose a serious threat to public health (such as resistant Gram-positive pathogens, multi-drug resistant Gram-negative bacteria, multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, and  C. difficile) and that is included in a list established and maintained by FDA. A drug sponsor may request the FDA to designate its product as a QIDP any time before the submission of an NDA. The FDA must make a QIDP determination within 60 days of the designation request. A product designated as a QIDP will be granted priority review by the FDA and can qualify for "fast track" status. 
         The additional five years of exclusivity under the GAIN Act for drug products designated by the FDA as QIDPs applies only to a drug that is first approved on or after July 9, 2012. Additionally, the five year exclusivity extension does not apply to: a supplement to an application under FDCA Section 505(b) for any QIDP for which an extension is in effect or has expired; a subsequent application filed with respect to a product approved by the FDA for a change that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength; or a product that does not meet the definition of a QIDP under Section 505(g) based upon its approved uses. The FDA has designated IV fosfomycin, and each of the IV and oral formulations of lefamulin as a QIDP and also granted fast track designations. 
   Patent Term Restoration and Extension 
         A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted on a patent covering a product is typically one-half the time between the effective date of a clinical investigation involving human beings is begun and the submission date of an application, plus the time between the submission date of an application and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product's approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The United States Patent and Trademark Offices reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA. 
 Regulation Outside the United States 
         In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of drug products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for lefamulin, the company would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.

     Regulation and Marketing Authorization in the European Union 
         The process governing approval of medicinal products in the European Union follows essentially the same lines as in the United States and, likewise, generally involves satisfactorily completing each of the following:


 preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies all performed in accordance with the applicable E.U. Good Laboratory
Practice regulations; 
 submission to the relevant national authorities of a clinical trial application, or CTA, which must be approved before human clinical trials
may begin; 
 performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each proposed indication; 
 submission to the relevant competent authorities of a marketing authorization application, or MAA, which includes the data supporting safety
and efficacy as well as detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product in clinical development and proposed labelling; 
 satisfactory completion of an inspection by the relevant national authorities of the manufacturing facility or facilities, including those of
third parties, at which the product is produced to assess compliance with strictly enforced cGMP; 
 potential audits of the non-clinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the MAA; and 
 review and approval by the relevant competent authority of the MAA before any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the product. 

 Preclinical Studies 
         Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animal studies, in order to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with the relevant E.U. regulations and requirements. The results of the preclinical tests, together with relevant manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of the CTA. 
 Clinical Trial Approval 
         Requirements for the conduct of clinical trials in the European Union including Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, are set forth in the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and the GCP Directive 2005/28/EC. Pursuant to Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC, as amended, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union has been implemented through national legislation of the E.U. member states. Under this system, approval must be obtained from the competent national authority of each E.U. member state in which a study is planned to be conducted. To this end, a CTA is submitted, which must be supported by an investigational medicinal product dossier, or IMPD, and further supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC and other applicable guidance documents. Furthermore, a clinical trial may only be started after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion on the clinical trial application in that country. 
         In April 2014, the E.U. passed the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014, which will replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. The Regulation was published on June 16, 2014 but is not expected to apply until later in 2019. To ensure that the rules for clinical trials are identical throughout the European Union, the new E.U. clinical trials legislation was passed as a 
 46

   regulation that is directly applicable in all E.U. member states. All clinical trials performed in the European Union are required to be conducted in accordance with the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC until the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 becomes applicable. The Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC will, however, still apply three years from the date of entry into application of the Clinical Trials Regulation to (i) clinical trials applications submitted before the entry into application and (ii) clinical trials applications submitted within one year after the entry into application if the sponsor opts for the old system. 
         The new Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trial in the European Union. The main characteristics of the regulation include:
 

 a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point, the E.U. portal; 
 a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures that will spare sponsors
from submitting broadly identical information separately to various bodies and different member states; 
 a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. Part I is assessed jointly
by all member states concerned. Part II is assessed separately by each member state concerned; 
 strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical trial applications; and 
 the involvement of the ethics committees in the assessment procedure in accordance with the national law of the member state concerned but
within the overall timelines defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation. 

 Marketing Authorization 
         Authorization to market a product in the member states of the European Union proceeds under one of four procedures: a centralized authorization procedure, a mutual recognition procedure, a decentralized procedure or a national procedure. 
 Centralized Authorization Procedure 
         The centralized procedure enables applicants to obtain a marketing authorization that is valid in all E.U. member states based on a single application. Certain medicinal products, including products developed by means of biotechnological processes must undergo the centralized authorization procedure for marketing authorization, which, if granted by the European Commission, is automatically valid in all 28 E.U. member states. The EMA and the European Commission administer this centralized authorization procedure pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. 
         Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, this procedure is mandatory for:
 

 medicinal products developed by means of one of the following biotechnological processes: 


 recombinant DNA technology; 
 controlled expression of genes coding for biologically active proteins in prokaryotes and eukaryotes including transformed
mammalian cells; and 
 hybridoma and monoclonal antibody methods; 

 advanced therapy medicinal products as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1394/2007 on advanced therapy medicinal
products; 

 47

   

 medicinal products for human use containing a new active substance that, on the date of effectiveness of this regulation, was not authorized in
the European Union, and for which the therapeutic indication is the treatment of any of the following diseases: 


 acquired immune deficiency syndrome; 
 cancer; 
 neurodegenerative disorder; 
 diabetes; 
 auto-immune diseases and other immune dysfunctions; and 
 viral diseases; and 

 medicinal products that are designated as orphan medicinal products pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 141/2000. 

         The centralized authorization procedure is optional for other medicinal products if they contain a new active substance or if the applicant shows that the medicinal product concerned constitutes a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or that the granting of authorization is in the interest of patients in the European Union. 
   Administrative Procedure 
         Under the centralized authorization procedure, the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP serves as the scientific committee that renders opinions about the safety, efficacy and quality of medicinal products for human use on behalf of the EMA. The CHMP is composed of experts nominated by each member state's national authority for medicinal products, with one of them appointed to act as Rapporteur for the co-ordination of the evaluation with the possible assistance of a further member of the Committee acting as a Co-Rapporteur. After approval, the Rapporteur(s) continue to monitor the product throughout its life cycle. The CHMP has 210 days, to adopt an opinion as to whether a marketing authorization should be granted. The process usually takes longer in case additional information is requested, which triggers clock-stops in the procedural timelines. The process is complex and involves extensive consultation with the regulatory authorities of member states and a number of experts. When an application is submitted for a marketing authorization in respect of a drug that is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation, the applicant may pursuant to Article 14(9) Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 request an accelerated assessment procedure. If the CHMP accepts such request, the time-limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days but it is possible that the CHMP can revert to the standard time-limit for the centralized procedure if it considers that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment. Once the procedure is completed, a European Public Assessment Report, or EPAR, is produced. If the opinion is negative, information is given as to the grounds on which this conclusion was reached. After the adoption of the CHMP opinion, a decision on the MAA must be adopted by the European Commission, after consulting the E.U. member states, which in total can take more than 60 days. 
 Conditional Approval 
         In specific circumstances, E.U. legislation (Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Regulation (EC) No 507/2006 on Conditional Marketing Authorizations for Medicinal Products for Human Use) enables applicants to obtain a conditional marketing authorization prior to obtaining the comprehensive clinical data required for an application for a full marketing authorization. Such conditional approvals may be granted for product candidates (including medicines designated as orphan medicinal products), if (1) the risk-benefit balance of the product candidate is positive, (2) it is likely that the applicant will be 
 48

   in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data, (3) the product fulfills unmet medical needs and (4) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. A conditional marketing authorization may contain specific obligations to be fulfilled by the marketing authorization holder, including obligations with respect to the completion of ongoing or new studies, and with respect to the collection of pharmacovigilance data. Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year, and may be renewed annually, if the risk-benefit balance remains positive, and after an assessment of the need for additional or modified conditions and/or specific obligations. The timelines for the centralized procedure described above also apply with respect to the review by the CHMP of applications for a conditional marketing authorization. 
   Marketing Authorization Under Exceptional Circumstances 
         Under Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, products for which the applicant can demonstrate that comprehensive data (in line with the requirements laid down in Annex I of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended) cannot be provided (due to specific reasons foreseen in the legislation) might be eligible for marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances. This type of authorization is reviewed annually to reassess the risk-benefit balance. The fulfillment of any specific procedures/obligations imposed as part of the marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances is aimed at the provision of information on the safe and effective use of the product and will normally not lead to the completion of a full dossier/approval. 
 Market Authorizations Granted by Authorities of E.U. Member States 
         In general, if the centralized procedure is not followed, there are three alternative procedures to obtain a marketing authorization in (one or several) E.U. member states as prescribed in Directive 2001/83/EC:


 The decentralized procedure allows applicants to file identical applications to several E.U. member states and receive simultaneous national
approvals based on the recognition by E.U. member states of an assessment by a reference member state. 
 The national procedure is only available for products intended to be authorized in a single E.U. member state. 
 A mutual recognition procedure similar to the decentralized procedure is available when a marketing authorization has already been obtained in
at least one E.U. member state. 

         A marketing authorization may be granted only to an applicant established in the European Union. 
   Pediatric Studies 
         Prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the E.U., applicants have to demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, a class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. The respective requirements for all marketing authorization procedures are set forth in Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, which is referred to as the Pediatric Regulation. This requirement also applies when a company wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized. The Pediatric Committee of the EMA, or PDCO, may grant deferrals for some medicines, allowing a company to delay development of the medicine in children until there is enough information to demonstrate its effectiveness and safety in adults. The PDCO may also grant 
 49

   waivers when development of a medicine in children is not needed or is not appropriate, such as for diseases that only affect the elderly population. 
         Before a marketing authorization application can be filed, or an existing marketing authorization can be amended, the EMA determines that companies actually comply with the agreed studies and measures listed in each relevant PIP. 
   Period of Authorization and Renewals 
         A marketing authorization, other than a conditional marketing authorization, is initially valid for five years and the marketing authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state. To this end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the drug on the E.U. market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing member state within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause). 
   Regulatory Data Protection 
         European Union legislation also provides for a system of regulatory data and market exclusivity. According to Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, as amended, and Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended, upon receiving marketing authorization, new chemical entities approved on the basis of complete independent data package benefit from eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. Data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator's data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization application can be submitted, and the innovator's data may be referenced, but no generic medicinal product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder, or MAH, obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity and the innovator is able to gain the period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the drug if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical test, preclinical tests and clinical trials. 
 Transparency 
         There is an increasing trend in the E.U. towards greater transparency and, while the manufacturing or quality information in marketing authorization dossiers is currently generally protected as confidential information, the EMA and national regulatory authorities are now liable to disclose much of the non-clinical and clinical information, including the full clinical study reports, in response to freedom of information requests after the marketing authorization has been granted. In October 2014, the EMA adopted a policy under which clinical study reports would be posted on the agency's website following the grant, denial or withdrawal of a marketing authorization application, subject to procedures for limited redactions and protection against unfair commercial use. Additional 
 50

   transparency provisions are contained in the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 that will take effect in May 2016 at the earliest. 
   Regulatory Requirements After a Marketing Authorization has been Obtained 
         If we obtain authorization for a medicinal product in the European Union, we will be required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products: 
 Pharmacovigilance and Other Requirements 
         We will, for example, have to comply with the E.U.'s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules, pursuant to which post-authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations can be imposed. E.U. regulators may conduct inspections to verify our compliance with applicable requirements, and we will have to continue to expend time, money and effort to remain compliant. Non-compliance with E.U. requirements regarding safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance, and with requirements related to the development of products for the pediatric population, can also result in significant financial penalties in the European Union. Similarly, failure to comply with the European Union's requirements regarding the protection of individual personal data can also lead to significant penalties and sanctions. Individual E.U. member states may also impose various sanctions and penalties in case we do not comply with locally applicable requirements. 
 Manufacturing 
         The manufacturing of authorized drugs, for which a separate manufacturer's license is mandatory, must be conducted in strict compliance with the EMA's GMP requirements and comparable requirements of other regulatory bodies in the European Union, which mandate the methods, facilities and controls used in manufacturing, processing and packing of drugs to assure their safety and identity. The EMA enforces its GMP requirements through mandatory registration of facilities and inspections of those facilities. The EMA may have a coordinating role for these inspections while the responsibility for carrying them out rests with the member states competent authority under whose responsibility the manufacturer falls. Failure to comply with these requirements could interrupt supply and result in delays, unanticipated costs and lost revenues, and could subject the applicant to potential legal or regulatory action, including but not limited to warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil and criminal penalties. 
 Marketing and Promotion 
         The marketing and promotion of authorized drugs, including industry-sponsored continuing medical education and advertising directed toward the prescribers of drugs and/or the general public, are strictly regulated in the European Union under Directive 2001/83EC, as amended. The applicable regulations aim to ensure that information provided by holders of marketing authorizations regarding their products is truthful, balanced and accurately reflects the safety and efficacy claims authorized by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. 
 Patent Term Extension 
         To compensate the patentee for delays in obtaining a marketing authorization for a patented product, a supplementary certificate, or SPC, may be granted extending the exclusivity period for that specific product by up to five years. Applications for SPCs must be made to the relevant patent office in each E.U. member state and the granted certificates are valid only in the member state of grant. An 
 51

   application has to be made by the patent owner within six months of the first marketing authorization being granted in the European Union (assuming the patent in question has not expired, lapsed or been revoked) or within six months of the grant of the patent (if the marketing authorization is granted first). In the context of SPCs, the term "product" means the active ingredient or combination of active ingredients for a medicinal product and the term "patent" means a patent protecting such a product or a new manufacturing process or application for it. The duration of an SPC is calculated as the difference between the patent's filing date and the date of the first marketing authorization, minus five years, subject to a maximum term of five years. 
         A six-month pediatric extension of an SPC may be obtained where the patentee has carried out an agreed pediatric investigation plan, the authorized product information includes information on the results of the studies and the product is authorized in all member states of the European Union. 
   Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom 
         On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the E.U. (commonly referred to as "Brexit"). Thereafter, on March 29, 2017, the country formally notified the E.U. of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The withdrawal of the U.K. from the European Union will take effect either on the effective date of the withdrawal agreement or, in the absence of agreement, two years after the U.K. provides a notice of withdrawal pursuant to the E.U. Treaty. Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the U.K. covering quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from E.U. directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the U.K. It remains to be seen how, if at all, Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the U.K. 
         The United Kingdom has a period of a maximum of two years from the date of its formal notification to negotiate the terms of its withdrawal from, and future relationship with, the E.U. If no formal withdrawal agreement is reached between the United Kingdom and the E.U., then it is expected the United Kingdom's membership of the E.U. will automatically terminate two years after the submission of the notification of the United Kingdom's intention to withdraw from the E.U. Discussions between the United Kingdom and the E.U. focused on finalizing withdrawal issues and transition agreements are ongoing. However, limited progress to date in these negotiations and ongoing uncertainty within the UK Government and Parliament sustains the possibility of the United Kingdom leaving the E.U. on March 29, 2019 without a withdrawal agreement and associated transition period in place, which is likely to cause significant market and economic disruption. 
 


General Data Protection Regulation 

         The collection, use, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the E.U., including personal health data, is subject to the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the E.U., including the U.S., and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for 
 52

   damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase the cost of doing business or require companies to change their business practices to ensure full compliance. 
   Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
         In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. 
         To secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable marketing approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product candidate could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a payor's decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor's determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. 
         The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company's revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
         Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for a product also involves challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of a product to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in commercialization. 
         In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been 
 53

   agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies or so called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. E.U. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states, and parallel trade, i.e., arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any products, if approved in those countries. 
   Healthcare Law and Regulation 
         Healthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims laws, reporting of payments to physicians and teaching physicians and patient privacy laws and regulations and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:


 the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering,
paying, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any
good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid; 
 the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit
individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false, fictitious or fraudulent or knowingly
making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; 
 the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal laws that
prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 
 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and their regulations, including the Final Omnibus
Rule published in January 2013, which impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health
information;

 the federal false statements statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making
any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; 
 the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making, or offering or promising to make
improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or otherwise seeking favorable treatment; 
 the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care
Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually
to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value made by
that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and 
 analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to healthcare items or
services that are reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers. 

         Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
   Healthcare Reform 
         A primary trend in the United States healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States. 
         In March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Affordable Care Act, or the ACA, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for products under government health care programs. Among the provisions of the Affordable Care Act of importance to potential drug candidates are:
 

 an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned
among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan
indications; 
 expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain
individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer's Medicaid rebate liability; 

 55



 expanded manufacturers' rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic
drugs and revising the definition of "average manufacturer price," or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices and extending rebate liability to
prescriptions for individuals enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans; 
 addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are
inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; 
 expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program; 
 established the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program by requiring manufacturers to provide a 50% point-of-sale-discount off the
negotiated price of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers' outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; 
 a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research,
along with funding for such research; 
 the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, which has authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce
expenditures by the program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs. However, the IPAB implementation has been not been clearly defined. PPACA provided that under certain
circumstances, IPAB recommendations will become law unless Congress enacts legislation that will achieve the same or greater Medicare cost savings; and 
 established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare
and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. Funding has been allocated to support the mission of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation from 2011 to 2019. 

         Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, led to aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year that started in 2013 and will stay in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken, and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used. Further, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. 
         Since enactment of the ACA, there have been numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. For example, with enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was signed by the President on December 22, 2017, Congress repealed the "individual mandate." The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, will become effective in 2019. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the repeal of the individual mandate will cause 13 million fewer Americans to be insured in 2027 and premiums in insurance markets may rise. Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain 
 56

   ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called "Cadillac" tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the "donut hole". 
         The Trump Administration has also taken executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the ACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. One Executive Order directs federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. The second Executive Order terminates the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the ACA. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017. In addition, CMS has recently proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. Further, on June 14, 2018, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than $12 billion in ACA risk corridor payments to third-party payors who argued were owed to them. The effects of this gap in reimbursement on third-party payors, the viability of the ACA marketplace, providers, and potentially our business, are not yet known. 
         Further, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed federal and proposed and enacted state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed federal and proposed and enacted state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. For example, on May 11, 2018, the Administration issued a plan to lower drug prices. Under this blueprint for action, the Administration indicated that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will: take steps to end the gaming of regulatory and patent processes by drug makers to unfairly protect monopolies; advance biosimilars and generics to boost price competition; evaluate the inclusion of prices in drug makers' ads to enhance price competition; speed access to and lower the cost of new drugs by clarifying policies for sharing information between insurers and drug makers; avoid excessive pricing by relying more on value-based pricing by expanding outcome-based payments in Medicare and Medicaid; work to give Part D plan sponsors more negotiation power with drug makers; examine which Medicare Part B drugs could be negotiated for a lower price by Part D plans, and improving the design of the Part B Competitive Acquisition Program; update Medicare's drug-pricing dashboard to increase transparency; prohibit Part D contracts that include "gag rules" that prevent pharmacists from informing patients when they could pay less out-of-pocket by not using insurance; and require that Part D plan members be provided with an annual statement of plan payments, out-of-pocket spending, and drug price increases. 
 57

           At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures. 
   Employees 
         As of January 31, 2019, we had 110 employees, 1 employee was based in Dublin, Ireland, 39 of our employees are located in Vienna, Austria and 70 of our employees located in the U.S., with 47 located in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania and the remaining 23 employees in the field. 
         Our employees in Austria are subject to the collective bargaining agreement of the chemical industry. This is an annual agreement between the employer representatives and the trade union of an industry. It defines conditions of employment, such as minimum wages, working hours and conditions, overtime payments, vacations and other matters. 
         We consider our relations with our employees to be good. 
   Our Corporate Information 
         On March 1, 2017, Nabriva Ireland was incorporated in Ireland under the name Hyacintho 2 plc, and was renamed to Nabriva Therapeutics plc on April 10, 2017, in order to effectuate the change of the jurisdiction of incorporation of the ultimate parent company of the Nabriva Group from Austria to Ireland. Nabriva Ireland replaced Nabriva Austria as the ultimate parent company on June 23, 2017, following the conclusion of a tender offer in which holders of the outstanding share capital of Nabriva Austria exchanged their holdings for ordinary shares, $0.01 nominal value per share, of Nabriva Ireland. The ordinary shares of Nabriva Ireland were issued on a one-for-ten basis to the holders of the Nabriva Austria common shares and on a one-for-one basis to the holders of the Nabriva Austria American Depositary Shares, or Nabriva Austria ADSs. On June 26, 2017, the ordinary shares of Nabriva Ireland began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol "NBRV," the same symbol under which the Nabriva Austria ADSs were previously traded. This transaction was accounted for as a merger between entities under common control; accordingly, the historical financial statements of Nabriva Austria for periods prior to this transaction are considered to be the historical financial statements of Nabriva Ireland. Our executive offices are located at 25-28 North Wall Quay IFSC, Dublin 1, Ireland, and our telephone number is +353 1 649 2000. 
         The predecessor of Nabriva Ireland, Nabriva Austria, was incorporated in Austria as a spin-off from Sandoz GmbH in October 2005 under the name Nabriva Therapeutics Forschungs GmbH, a limited liability company organized under Austrian law and commenced operations in February 2006. In 2007, Nabriva Austria transformed into a stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft) under the name Nabriva Therapeutics AG. On October 19, 2017, Nabriva Austria was converted into a private limited liability company under Austrian law and renamed Nabriva Therapeutics GmbH. 
         Our U.S. operations are conducted by our wholly-owned subsidiary Nabriva Therapeutics US, Inc., a Delaware corporation established in August 2014 and located at 1000 Continental Drive, Suite 600, King of Prussia, PA 19406.

      ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS 
        You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following risks are realized, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. The risks described below are not the only risks facing us. Risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.
 Risks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital 
           We have incurred significant losses since our inception. We expect to incur losses for at least the next several years and may never generate profits from operations or maintain profitability. 
         Since inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were $114.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, $74.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $54.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $394.0 million. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of our equity securities, loans, including convertible loans, and research and development support from governmental grants and loans. We have devoted most of our efforts to research and development, including clinical trials. We have not completed development of any drugs. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years, including in connection with our regulatory approval efforts and commercialization of lefamulin and CONTEPO. The net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. 
         We expect to continue to invest in critical pre-commercialization activities prior to potentially receiving marketing approval and making lefamulin and CONTEPO available to patients. 
         We initiated our first Phase 3 global, pivotal clinical trial of lefamulin, which we refer to as Lefamulin Evaluation Against Pneumonia 1, or LEAP 1, in September 2015, and we initiated our second Phase 3 global, pivotal clinical trial of lefamulin, which we refer to as Lefamulin Evaluation Against Pneumonia 2, or LEAP 2, in April 2016. In September 2017, we announced positive topline results for LEAP 1. In May 2018, we announced positive topline results from LEAP 2. LEAP 2 evaluated the safety and efficacy of five days of oral lefamulin compared to 7 days of oral moxifloxacin in adult patients with moderate community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, or CABP. We submitted two 
 59

   NDAs for marketing approval of lefamulin for the treatment of CABP in adults in the United States in December 2018. We also expect to submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA, for lefamulin for the treatment of CABP in adults in Europe in the first half of 2019. We also continue to characterize the clinical pharmacology of lefamulin. If we obtain marketing approval of lefamulin for CABP or another indication, we also expect to incur significant additional sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing expenses. 
         In June 2016, the first patient was enrolled by Zavante in its pivotal ZTI-01 Efficacy and Safety Study of CONTEPO, which we refer to as the ZEUS Study. In April 2017, Zavante announced positive topline results of the ZEUS Study. The ZEUS Study was a multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind Phase 2/3, pivotal clinical trial designed to evaluate safety, tolerability, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of seven days of treatment, or up to 14 days of treatment for patients with concurrent bacteremia, with CONTEPO compared to piperacillin-tazobactam, or PIP-TAZ, in the treatment of hospitalized adults with cUTI or acute pyelonephritis, or AP. We submitted an NDA for marketing approval of CONTEPO for the treatment of cUTI in adults in the United States, utilizing the FDA's 505(b)(2) pathway, in October 2018. In June 2018, Zavante initiated a Phase 1, non-comparative, open-label study of the pharmacokinetics and safety of a single dose of CONTEPO in pediatric subjects less than 12 years of age receiving standard-of-care antibiotic therapy for proven or suspected infection or peri-operative prophylaxis. We anticipate completing enrollment in this study in late 2020. We also intend to continue to characterize the clinical pharmacology of CONTEPO. If we obtain marketing approval of CONTEPO for cUTI, including AP, or another indication, we also expect to incur significant additional sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing expenses. 
         On July 24, 2018, we completed our Acquisition of Zavante. Upfront consideration in connection with the Acquisition was 8,152,092 of our ordinary shares, including the 815,186 ordinary shares that are issuable upon release of the Holdback Shares subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, former Zavante stockholders are also entitled to receive from us up to $97.5 million in contingent consideration, consisting of the Approval Milestone Payment and the Net Sales Milestone Payment, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement. In connection with the Acquisition, we assumed certain payment obligations under the Stock Purchase Agreement and Zavante manufacturing agreements acquired in the Acquisition. See "Risks Related to Our Acquisition of ZavanteWe may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of our Acquisition of Zavante, those benefits may take longer to realize than expected, and we may encounter significant integration difficulties." 
         In addition, our expenses will increase if and as we:
 

 initiate or continue the research and development of lefamulin and CONTEPO for additional indications and of our other product candidates; 
 seek to develop additional product candidates; 
 seek marketing approval for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical development; 
 are required by the FDA, EMA or other regulators to conduct additional clinical trials prior to or after approval; 
 continue to build a medical affairs, sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure and scale up manufacturing capabilities to commercialize
any product candidates for which we receive marketing approval; 
 in-license or acquire other products, product candidates or technologies; 
 maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; 

 60

   

 expand our physical presence in the United States and Ireland; 
 incur additional debt; 
 establish and expand manufacturing arrangements with third parties; and 
 add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development, our
operations as a larger company following the Acquisition and our operations as a public company in addition to our planned future commercialization efforts. 

         Our ability to generate profits from operations, and to become and remain profitable, depends on our ability to successfully develop and commercialize drugs that generate significant revenue. Based on our current plans, we do not expect to generate significant revenue unless and until we obtain marketing approval for, and commercialize, lefamulin and CONTEPO. We do not expect to obtain marketing approval for CONTEPO before April 2019 or for lefamulin before August 2019, if at all. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including:
 

 obtaining marketing approval for lefamulin and CONTEPO; 
 expanding medical affairs, sales, marketing and distribution capabilities to effectively market and sell lefamulin and CONTEPO in the United
States; 
 establishing and maintaining collaboration, distribution or other marketing arrangements with third parties to commercialize lefamulin in
markets outside the United States; 
 protecting our rights to our intellectual property portfolio related to lefamulin and CONTEPO; 
 establishing and maintaining arrangements for the manufacture of and obtaining commercial quantities of lefamulin and CONTEPO; and 
 negotiating and securing adequate reimbursement from third-party payors for lefamulin and CONTEPO. 

         We may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, may never generate revenues that are significant enough to generate profits from operations. Even if we do generate profits from operations, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to generate profits from operations, and to become and remain profitable, would decrease the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our research and development efforts, diversify our product offerings or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could also cause our shareholders to lose all or part of their investment. 
           We will need substantial additional funding. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on acceptable terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or future commercialization efforts. 
         We expect to continue to incur substantial costs in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we seek marketing approval for lefamulin, CONTEPO and, possibly, other product candidates and continue our research activities. Our expenses will increase if we suffer any regulatory delays or are required to conduct additional clinical trials to satisfy regulatory requirements. If we obtain marketing approval for lefamulin, CONTEPO or any other product candidate that we develop, in-license or acquire, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing. 
         Furthermore, we expect to continue to incur additional costs to service our current debt and any potential future draws on the Loan Agreement (as defined below) and costs associated with operating as a public company and as a company with a commercial rather than a research and development 
 61

   focus. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts. 
         We expect that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2018, proceeds from the sale of ordinary shares under the our ATM Agreement (as defined below) of $5.9 million in the first quarter of 2019, as well as a $1.5 million milestone payment received in February 2019 under our license agreement with Sinovant Sciences, Ltd., and research premiums from the Austrian government for our qualified research and development expenditures, will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses, debt service obligations and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter of 2020. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we currently expect. This estimate assumes, among other things, that we do not obtain any additional funding through grants and clinical trial support, collaboration agreements, equity or debt financings, including additional advances under the Loan Agreement with Hercules. We may be eligible to borrow up an additional $50.0 million under our Loan Agreement with Hercules if we achieve specified regulatory and product revenue milestones, including $10.0 million that we will be eligible to borrow upon the approval by the FDA of an NDA for lefamulin and $5.0 million that we will be eligible to borrow upon the approval by the FDA of an NDA for CONTEPO. 
         We expect to seek additional funding in future periods for purposes of investment in our commercial and medical affairs organization, as well as investing in our supply chain in an effort to enhance the potential commercial launch of lefamulin and CONTEPO. 
         Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:
 

 the costs and timing of process development and manufacturing scale-up activities associated with lefamulin and CONTEPO; 
 the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of lefamulin and CONTEPO; 
 the costs of commercialization activities for lefamulin and CONTEPO if we receive, or expect to receive, marketing approval, including the
costs and timing of establishing product sales, marketing, distribution and outsourced manufacturing capabilities, including the costs of building finished product inventory and its components in
preparation of initial marketing of lefamulin and CONTEPO; 
 subject to receipt of marketing approval, revenue received from commercial sales of lefamulin and CONTEPO; 
 the costs of developing lefamulin and CONTEPO for the treatment of additional indications; 
 our ability to establish collaborations on favorable terms, if at all; 
 the scope, progress, results and costs of product development of any other product candidates that we may develop; 
 the extent to which we in-license or acquire rights to other products, product candidates or technologies; 
 the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending
against intellectual property-related claims; 
 the continued availability of Austrian governmental grants; 
 the rate of the expansion of our physical presence in the United States and Ireland; 

 62

   

 interest expense on our debt and the eventual repayment of our debt obligations; 
 the costs of operating as a company with a commercial rather than a research and development focus; and 
 the costs of operating as a public company in the United States. 

         Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of lefamulin, CONTEPO or any other products that we successfully develop, in-license or acquire, none of which we expect to be commercially available before April 2019, if at all. In addition, if approved, lefamulin, CONTEPO or any other product candidate that we develop, in-license or acquire may not achieve commercial success. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional financing to achieve our business objectives. 
         Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations, even if we believe that we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. 
           Raising additional capital may cause dilution to our security holders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish certain rights to our technologies or product candidates. 
         Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, and funding from local and international government entities and non-government organizations in the disease areas addressed by our product candidates and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a security holder. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. In addition, debt service obligations under any debt financings may limit the availability of our cash for other purposes, and we may be unable to make interest payments or repay the principal of such debt financings when due. 
         On March 16, 2018, we entered into a Controlled Equity OfferingSM Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., or Cantor Fitzgerald, as agent, pursuant to which we may offer and sell ordinary shares, nominal value $0.01 per share, for aggregate gross sale proceeds of up to $50,000,000 from time to time through Cantor Fitzgerald under an "at-the-market" offering program. As of December 31, 2018, $25.8 million remained available for sale under our ATM Agreement. As of March 1, 2019, $20.2 million remained available for sale under the ATM Agreement. If a large number of our ordinary shares is sold in the public market after they become eligible for sale or if we make additional sales under our "at-the-market" offering program, the sales could cause dilution to our security holders, reduce the trading price of our ordinary shares and impede our ability to raise future capital. 
         In addition, in connection with the closing of the Acquisition, we issued 7,336,906 of our ordinary shares to former Zavante stockholders as initial upfront consideration. An additional 815,186 of ordinary shares will be issued to former Zavante Stockholders upon release of the Holdback Shares, subject to reduction in respect of certain indemnification and other obligations pursuant to the Merger Agreement. The shares that were issued in connection with the closing of the Acquisition are able to be freely sold in the public market, subject to any requirements and restrictions, including any applicable volume limitations, imposed by Rule 144 under the Securities Act. While the Holdback Shares will be restricted as a result of securities laws at the time of issuance, following expiration of applicable holding periods, the Holdback Shares will also be able to be freely sold in the public market, subject to any requirements and restrictions, including any applicable volume limitations, imposed by Rule 144 under the Securities Act. In addition, the Merger Agreement provides that we may issue up 
 63

   to an additional $97.5 million in our ordinary shares to former Zavante stockholders upon the achievement of specified regulatory and commercial milestones in the future and obligates us to provide registration rights with respect to the registration for resale of such additional ordinary shares that may become issuable upon the achievement of such milestones. The issuance of our ordinary shares to satisfy the milestone payments will cause dilution to our equity holders, and the sale or resale of these shares in the public market, or the market's expectation of such sales, may result in an immediate and substantial decline in our stock price. Such a decline would adversely affect our investors and also might make it difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. 
         If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. 
           Our limited operating history may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability. 
         Our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, developing and securing our technology, raising capital, undertaking preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates, and preparing and filing NDAs for our product candidates. We have not yet demonstrated our ability to obtain marketing approvals, manufacture a commercial scale product, or arrange for a third party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization. Consequently, any predictions you make about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history. 
         In addition, as a new business, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown factors. Also, we may encounter delays or difficulties in our efforts to, or fail to, successfully integrate the operations of Zavante into our business and CONTEPO into our business strategy. Moreover, we will need to transition from a company with a research and development focus to a company capable of supporting commercial activities. We may not be successful in such a transition. 
           Our level of indebtedness and debt service obligations could adversely affect our financial condition and may make it more difficult for us to fund our operations. 
         On December 20, 2018, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement, or the Loan Agreement, with Hercules Capital, Inc., as administrative agent, collateral agent and lender, pursuant to which an aggregate principal amount of up to $75.0 million is available to us. As of December 31, 2018, we have drawn down on the initial term loan advance under the Loan Agreement of $25.0 million. 
         All obligations under the Loan Agreement are secured by substantially all of our personal property, intellectual property and other assets owned or later acquired. This indebtedness may create additional financing risk for us, particularly if our business or prevailing financial market conditions are not conducive to paying off or refinancing our outstanding debt obligations at maturity. This indebtedness could also have important negative consequences, including:
 

 the need to repay our indebtedness by making payment of interest only initially and then interest and principal, which will reduce the amount
of funds available to finance our operations, our research and development efforts and our general corporate activities; and 

 64

   

 our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants in the Loan Agreement or the occurrence of an event that has a material adverse effect on
our business, operations, properties, assets, condition, our ability to pay any amounts due, the collateral securing our obligations under the Loan Agreement or the ability of Hercules to enforce any
of its rights under the Loan Agreement could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, would accelerate our obligation to repay this indebtedness, and the lenders could seek to
enforce its security interest in the assets securing such indebtedness. 

         To the extent additional debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks described above could increase. 
           We may not have cash available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make interest or principal payments on our indebtedness when due. 
         Failure to satisfy our current and future debt obligations under the Loan Agreement could result in an event of default and, as a result, the lenders under the Loan Agreement could accelerate all of the amounts due. In the event of an acceleration of amounts due under the Loan Agreement as a result of an event of default, we may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for additional financing to repay our indebtedness. In addition, the lenders could seek to enforce their security interests in the assets securing such indebtedness. 
           We are subject to certain restrictive covenants which, if breached, could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. 
         The Loan Agreement imposes operating and other restrictions on us. Such restrictions will affect, and in many respects limit or prohibit, our ability and the ability of any future subsidiary to, among other things:
 

 declare dividends or redeem or repurchase equity interests; 
 incur additional indebtedness and liens; 
 make loans and investments; 
 engage in mergers, acquisitions and asset sales; 
 certain transactions with affiliates 
 undergo a change in control; 
 add or change business locations; and 
 settle in cash potential milestone payment obligations that may become payable by us in the future to former security holders of Zavante. 

         We are also required to satisfy certain financial covenants, including an obligation to maintain specified minimum amounts of cash and cash equivalents in accounts pledged to Hercules. These restrictive covenants may prevent us from undertaking an action that we feel is in the best interests of our business. In addition, if we were to breach any of these restrictive covenants, Hercules could accelerate our indebtedness under the Loan Agreement or enforce its security interest against our assets, either of which would materially adversely affect our ability to continue to operate our business. 
 65

             We have relied on, and expect to continue to rely on, certain government grants and funding from the Austrian government. Should these funds cease to be available, or our eligibility be reduced, or if we are required to repay any of these funds, this could impact our ongoing need for funding and the timeframes within which we currently expect additional funding will be required. 
         As a company that carried out extensive research and development activities, we have benefited from the Austrian research and development support regime, under which we were eligible to receive a research premium from the Austrian government equal to 14% (12% for the fiscal years 2016 and 2017 and 10%, in the case of fiscal years prior to 2016) of a specified research and development cost base. Qualifying expenditures largely comprised research and development activities conducted in Austria, however, the research premium was also available for certain related third-party expenses with additional limitations. We received research premiums of $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. We have not received any research premium for our qualified 2018 expenditures as of December 31, 2018. As we increase our personnel and expand our business outside of Austria, we may not be able to continue to claim research premiums to the same extent as we have in previous years or at all, as some research and development activities may no longer be considered to occur in Austria. As research premiums that have been paid out already may be audited by the tax authorities, there is a risk that parts of the submitted cost base may not be considered as eligible and therefore repayments may have to be made. 
           The intended efficiency of our corporate structure depends on the application of the tax laws and regulations in the countries where we operate, and we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities or our effective tax rate could change, which could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. 
         As a company with international operations, we are subject to income taxes, as well as non-income based taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. We have designed our corporate structure, the manner in which we develop and use our intellectual property, and our intercompany transactions between our subsidiaries in a way that is intended to enhance our operational and financial efficiency. The application of the tax laws and regulations of various countries in which we operate and to our global operations is subject to interpretation. We also must operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure to realize such efficiencies. The tax authorities of the countries in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or for transfer pricing. If, for one or more of these reasons, tax authorities determine that the manner in which we operate results in our business not achieving the intended tax consequences, our effective tax rate could increase and harm our financial position and results of operations. 
         A change in the tax law in the jurisdictions in which we do business, including an increase in tax rates, an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense, a decrease in tax rates in a jurisdiction in which we have significant deferred tax assets, or a new or different interpretation of applicable tax law, could result in a material increase in tax expense. 
   Risks Related to Product Development and Commercialization 
           We depend heavily on the success of, lefamulin, which we are developing for CABP and potentially other indications, and CONTEPO, which we are developing for cUTI, including AP. If we are unable to obtain marketing approvals for lefamulin or CONTEPO, or if thereafter we fail to commercialize lefamulin or CONTEPO or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed. 
         We have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of lefamulin and, more recently, in CONTEPO. There remains a significant risk that we will fail to 
 66

   successfully develop lefamulin for CABP or any other indication or CONTEPO for cUTI or any other indication. 
         In September 2017, we announced positive topline results for LEAP 1. In May 2018, we announced positive topline results from LEAP 2. We submitted two new drug applications, or NDAs, for marketing approval of lefamulin for the treatment of CABP in adults in the United States in December 2018. We also expect to submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA, for lefamulin for the treatment of CABP in adults in Europe in the first half of 2019. In mid-2018, we initiated a Phase 1, non-comparative, open-label study of the pharmacokinetics and safety of a single dose of IV lefamulin in pediatric subjects 12 to 18 years of age. 
         In June 2016, Zavante initiated the ZEUS Study. In April 2017, Zavante announced positive topline results of the ZEUS Study. We submitted an NDA for marketing approval of CONTEPO for the treatment of cUTI in adults in the United States, utilizing the FDA's 505(b)(2) pathway, in October 2018. In June 2018, Zavante initiated a phase 1, non-comparative, open-label study of the pharmacokinetics and safety of a single dose of CONTEPO in pediatric subjects less than 12 years of age receiving standard-of-care antibiotic therapy for proven or suspected infection or peri-operative prophylaxis. We anticipate completing enrollment in this study in late 2020. We also intend to continue to characterize the clinical pharmacology of CONTEPO. 
         If we obtain marketing approval of lefamulin for CABP, or any other indication, and CONTEPO for cUTI, including AP, or any other indication, we also expect to incur significant additional sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing expenses. 
         Our ability to generate product revenues will depend heavily on our obtaining marketing approval for and commercializing lefamulin and CONTEPO when and as we expect, and our ability to successfully integrate Zavante into our business and CONTEPO into our business strategy. The success of lefamulin and CONTEPO will depend on a number of factors, including the following:
 

 establishing and maintaining arrangements with third-party manufacturers for commercial supply and receiving regulatory approval of our
manufacturing processes and our third-party manufacturers' facilities from applicable regulatory authorities; 
 receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities for lefamulin for the treatment of CABP and CONTEPO for the treatment of
cUTI, including AP; 
 launching commercial sales of lefamulin and CONTEPO, if and when approved, in collaboration with third parties; 
 acceptance of lefamulin and CONTEPO, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors; 
 effectively competing with other therapies; 
 maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of lefamulin and CONTEPO following approval; 
 obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity; and 
 protecting our rights in our intellectual property portfolio. 

         Successful development of lefamulin and CONTEPO for the treatment of additional indications, if any, or for use in other patient populations and our ability, if it is approved, to broaden the labels for lefamulin and CONTEPO will depend on similar factors. 
         If we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize lefamulin for CABP or for 
 67

   any other indication or CONTEPO for cUTI, including AP or for any other indication, which would materially harm our business. 
           If clinical trials of lefamulin, CONTEPO or any of our other product candidates fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, regulatory authorities in the European Union, or other regulatory authorities or do not otherwise produce favorable results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of lefamulin, CONTEPO or any other product candidate. 
         Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of any product candidate, we must complete preclinical development and early clinical trials, including Phase 1 clinical trials, in addition to extensive later-stage Phase 3 clinical trials, to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. The outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. The design of a clinical trial can determine whether its results will support approval of a product, and flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced or completed. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their products. In connection with the ZEUS Study in which CONTEPO met the primary endpoint of statistical non-inferiority versus piperacillin/tazobactam, Zavante conducted a post-hoc primary efficacy analysis of CONTEPO using results of blinded pulsed-field gel electrophoresis molecular typing of urinary tract pathogens. Regulatory authorities typically give greater weight to results from pre-specified analyses and less weight to results from post-hoc, retrospective analyses. While we believe this post-hoc analysis is illustrative information, the FDA may ultimately have a different interpretation of any of our data that may be based on such post-hoc analysis. 
         If we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing or studies of lefamulin, CONTEPO or any other product candidate that we develop beyond those that we contemplate; if we are unable to successfully complete our clinical trials or other testing or studies; if the results of these trials, tests or studies are not positive or are only modestly positive; if there are safety concerns; or if they are otherwise not acceptable to the FDA, we may:
 

 be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates; 
 not obtain marketing approval at all; 
 obtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired; 
 obtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings, including boxed warnings; 
 be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements or restrictions; 
 have the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval; or 
 need to raise capital before we otherwise would or on terms less favorable to us. 

         The occurrence of any of the developments listed above could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 68

          
          If we experience any of a number of possible unforeseen events in connection with our clinical trials, the potential marketing approval or commercialization of lefamulin, CONTEPO or other product candidates could be delayed or prevented. 
         We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, our clinical trials of lefamulin and CONTEPO or other product candidates that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize lefamulin, CONTEPO or our other product candidates, including:
 

 clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical
trials or abandon product development programs; 
 the number of patients required for clinical trials may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we
anticipate or participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate; 
 our third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or
at all; 
 regulators, institutional review boards or independent ethics committees may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial
or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site or may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory
requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks; 
 we may experience delays in reaching or fail to reach agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with
prospective trial sites; 
 we may have to suspend or terminate clinical trials of our product candidates for various reasons, including a finding that the participants
are being exposed to unacceptable health or safety risks; 
 the cost of clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate; 
 the supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be
insufficient or inadequate; and 
 our product candidates may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, causing us or our investigators, regulators,
institutional review boards or independent ethics committees to suspend or terminate the trials. 

         Our product development costs will increase if we experience delays in enrollment in our clinical development program or our non-clinical development program or in obtaining marketing approvals. We do not know whether any additional non-clinical tests or clinical trials will be required, or if they will begin as planned, or if they will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. Significant non-clinical development program delays, including chemistry, manufacturing and control activities, or clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations. 
           If we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in our clinical trials, our receipt of necessary marketing approvals could be delayed or prevented. 
         We may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for our product candidates, including with respect to lefamulin, CONTEPO or any other product candidate that we develop, if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these clinical trials. Some of our competitors have ongoing clinical trials for product candidates that could be competitive with 
 69

   lefamulin and CONTEPO, and patients who would otherwise be eligible for our clinical trials may instead enroll in clinical trials of our competitors' product candidates. 
         Patient enrollment is affected by other factors including:
 

 severity of the disease under investigation; 
 eligibility criteria for the clinical trial in question; 
 perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study; 
 approval of other therapies to treat the disease under investigation; 
 efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials; 
 patient referral practices of physicians; 
 the time of year in which the trial is initiated or conducted; 
 the geographic distribution of global trial sites, given the timing of pneumonia season globally, and the seasonal variation in the number of
patients suffering from pneumonia, including a decline in the number of patients with CABP during the summer months; 
 the ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; 
 proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients; 
 delays in the receipt of required regulatory approvals, or the failure to receive required regulatory approvals, in the jurisdictions in which
clinical trials are expected to be conducted; and 
 delays in the receipt of approvals, or the failure to receive approvals, from the relevant institutional review board or ethics committee at
clinical trial sites. 

         Enrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates, which would cause the value of the company to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing. Our inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients in any of our clinical trials would result in significant delays or may require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. 
           If serious adverse or undesirable side effects are identified during the development of lefamulin, CONTEPO or any other product candidate that we develop, we may need to abandon or limit our development of that product candidate. 
         It is impossible to predict when or if the FDA, EMA or other regulators will view any of our product candidates as effective and safe in humans or if we will receive marking approval for any of our product candidates. If our product candidates are associated with undesirable side effects or have characteristics that are unexpected, we may need to abandon their development or limit development to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. Many compounds that initially showed promise in clinical or earlier stage testing have later been found to cause side effects or other safety issues that prevented further development of the compound. 
         In LEAP 1, lefamulin was generally well tolerated and exhibited a similar rate of treatment-emergent adverse events to the comparator drug. However, 104 patients in the lefamulin arm of the trial reported at least one treatment-emergent adverse event and eight patients withdrew from the trial following an adverse event. Furthermore, at least 2.0% of patients in LEAP 1 who were dosed with lefamulin reported the following adverse events: hypokalemia, nausea, insomnia, infusion site pain and infusion site phlebitis. Fewer than 2.0% of trial patients dosed with lefamulin also experienced 
 70

   hypertension and an increase in alanine aminotransaminase, although no patients met Hy's Law criteria, which is an indicator for severe liver damage. 
         In LEAP 2, lefamulin was again generally well tolerated. However, 120 patients in the lefamulin arm of the trial reported at least one treatment-emergent adverse event and eleven patients withdrew from the trial following an adverse event. Furthermore, at least 2.0% of patients in LEAP 2 who were dosed with lefamulin reported the following adverse events: diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. Fewer than 2.0% of trial patients dosed with lefamulin also experienced hypertension and an increase in alanine aminotransaminase, although no patients met Hy's Law criteria. In addition, one patient who had a positive clinical response to lefamulin in LEAP 2 was later diagnosed with a C. difficile infection during an extended hospital stay. 
         In addition, lefamulin was well tolerated in our Phase 2 clinical trial for acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection, or ABSSSI. No patient in the trial suffered any serious adverse events that were found to be related to lefamulin, and no patient in the trial died. Some patients experienced adverse events that were assessed by the investigator as possibly or probably related to study medication. The majority of their symptoms were mild in severity. Four patients discontinued study medication following a drug-related event, three of whom were in a lefamulin treatment group: one patient experienced events of hyperhidrosis, vomiting and headache; one patient experienced infusion site pain; and one patient experienced dyspnea. 
         Because the potential for mild effect on electrocardiogram, or ECG, measurements was observed in preclinical studies of lefamulin, we have continued to assess this potential in all human clinical trials of lefamulin we have conducted. In the Phase 2 clinical trial, no change in ECG measurements was considered to be of clinical significance, and no drug-related cardiovascular adverse event was reported. Both lefamulin and vancomycin treatment were associated with a small increase in the QT interval. The QT interval is a measure of the heart's electrical cycle, and a prolonged QT interval is a risk factor for a potential ventricular arrhythmia. In each of LEAP 1 and LEAP 2, while changes in QT that were of potential clinical concern were uncommon, two patients treated with lefamulin had an increase in absolute QT interval to greater than 500 msec, regardless of baseline value, which may indicate a higher risk for ventricular arrhythmias. 
         There were no systemic adverse events of clinical concern and no drug-related serious adverse events observed in any of our completed Phase 1 clinical trials of lefamulin. In these trials, the most commonly observed adverse effects with oral administration of lefamulin were related to the gastrointestinal tract, including nausea and abdominal discomfort, while the most commonly observed adverse effects related to IV administration were related to irritation at the infusion site. In addition, lefamulin produced a transient, predictable and reproducible prolongation of the QT interval based on the maximum concentration of the drug in the blood plasma. We did not observe any drug-related cardiac adverse events, such as increase in ectopic ventricular activity or other cardiac arrhythmia, or clinically relevant ECG findings during the conduct of any of our completed Phase 1 clinical trials. 
         In the ZEUS Study, the incidence of premature discontinuation from study drug was low and similar between treatment groups (6.0% in the CONTEPO treatment group compared to 3.9% in the PIP-TAZ treatment group), and the incidence of not completing the study through the last follow-up visit, which occurred on the 24th through 28th day after completion of seven days of treatment with the study drug, or after up to 14 days of treatment for patients with concurrent bacteremia, was 5.2% in the CONTEPO group compared to 0.9% in the PIP-TAZ group. A total of 42.1% CONTEPO patients and 32.0% PIP-TAZ patients experienced at least one treatment-emergent adverse event. Most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild or moderate in severity, and severe treatment-emergent adverse events were uncommon (2.1% of CONTEPO patients and 1.7% of PIP-TAZ patients). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events in both treatment groups were transient, asymptomatic laboratory abnormalities and gastrointestinal events. Treatment-emergent serious adverse 
 71

   events were uncommon in both treatment groups (2.1% of CONTEPO patients and 2.6% of PIP-TAZ patients). There were no deaths in the study and one treatment-emergent serious adverse event in each treatment group was deemed related to study drug (hypokalemia in a CONTEPO patient and renal impairment in a PIP-TAZ patient), leading to study drug discontinuation in the PIP-TAZ patient. Study drug discontinuations due to the treatment-emergent adverse events were infrequent and similar between treatment groups (3.0% of CONTEPO patients and 2.6% of PIP-TAZ patients). 
         The most common laboratory abnormality treatment-emergent adverse events in the ZEUS Study were increases in the levels of alanine aminotransferase, or ALT, (8.6% of CONTEPO patients and 2.6% of PIP-TAZ patients) and aspartate transaminase, or AST, (7.3% of CONTEPO patients and 2.6% of PIP-TAZ patients). None of the ALT or AST elevations were symptomatic or treatment-limiting, and none of the patients met the criteria for Hy's Law. Outside the United States, elevated liver aminotransferases are listed among undesirable effects in the labeling for IV fosfomycin. 
         In the ZEUS Study, hypokalemia occurred in 71 of 232 (30.6%) CONTEPO patients and 29 of 230 (12.6%) PIP-TAZ patients. Most decreases in potassium levels were mild to moderate in severity. Shifts in potassium levels from normal at baseline to hypokalemia, as determined by worst post-baseline hypokalemia values, were more frequent in the CONTEPO group than the PIP-TAZ group for mild (17.7% compared to 11.3%), moderate (11.2% compared to 0.9%), and severe (1.7% compared to 0.4%) categories of hypokalemia. Hypokalemia was deemed a treatment-emergent adverse event in 6.4% of patients receiving CONTEPO and 1.3% of patients receiving PIP-TAZ, and all cases were transient and asymptomatic. 
         While no significant cardiac adverse events were observed in the ZEUS Study, post-baseline QT intervals calculated using Fridericia's formula, or QTcF, of greater than 450 to less than or equal to 480 msec (baseline QTcF of less than or equal to 450 msec) occurred at a higher frequency in CONTEPO patients (7.3%) compared to PIP-TAZ patients (2.5%). In the CONTEPO arm, these results appeared to be associated with the hypokalemia associated with the salt load of the IV formulation. Only one patient in the PIP-TAZ arm had a baseline QTcF of less than or equal to 500 msec and a post-baseline QTcF of greater than 500 msec. 
         If we elect or are forced to suspend or terminate any clinical trial of lefamulin, CONTEPO or any other product candidates that we are developing, the commercial prospects of lefamulin, CONTEPO or such other product candidates will be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues, if at all, from lefamulin, CONTEPO or any of these other product candidates will be delayed or eliminated. In addition, a higher rate of adverse events in lefamulin or CONTEPO as compared to the standard of care, even if slight, could negatively impact commercial adoption of lefamulin or CONTEPO by physicians. Any of these occurrences could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
           Even if lefamulin, CONTEPO or any other product candidate receives marketing approval, it may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success and the market opportunity for lefamulin, CONTEPO or any other product candidate may be smaller than we estimate. 
         If lefamulin, CONTEPO or any of our other product candidates receive marketing approval, it or they may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community. For example, current treatments for pneumonia, including generic options, are well established in the medical community, and doctors may continue to rely on these treatments without lefamulin, CONTEPO or any of our other product candidates. In addition, our efforts to effectively communicate the differentiating characteristics and key attributes of lefamulin, CONTEPO or any of our other product candidates to clinicians and hospital pharmacies with the goal of establishing favorable formulary status for lefamulin, CONTEPO or any of our other product 
 72

   candidates may fail or may be less successful than we expect. If lefamulin, CONTEPO or any of our other product candidates does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenues or any profits from operations. The degree of market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:
 

 the efficacy and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments; 
 the ability of lefamulin, CONTEPO or any other anti-infective product candidate to limit the development of bacterial resistance in the
pathogens it targets; 
 the prevalence and severity of any side effects; 
 the ability to offer our product candidates for sale at competitive prices, including in comparison to generic competition; 
 convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments; 
 the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies, physicians to prescribe these therapies and hospitals to approve the
cost and use by their physicians of these therapies; 
 our investment in and the strength of marketing, patient access and distribution support; 
 the availability of third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement; and 
 the timing of any marketing approval in relation to other product approvals. 

         Bacteria might develop resistance to lefamulin, CONTEPO or any future product candidates more rapidly or to a greater degree than we anticipate. If bacteria develop resistance or if lefamulin, CONTEPO or any future product candidates is not effective against drug-resistant bacteria, the efficacy of these product candidates would decline, which would negatively affect our potential to generate revenues from these product candidates. 
         Our ability to negotiate, secure and maintain third-party coverage and reimbursement may be affected by political, economic and regulatory developments in the United States, the European Union and other jurisdictions. Governments continue to impose cost containment measures, and third-party payors are increasingly challenging prices charged for medicines and examining their cost effectiveness, in addition to their safety and efficacy. If the level of reimbursement is below our expectations, our revenue and gross margins would be adversely affected. Obtaining formulary approval from third-party payors can be an expensive and time-consuming process. We cannot be certain if and when we will obtain formulary approval to allow us to sell lefamulin, CONTEPO or any future product candidates into our target markets. Even if we do obtain formulary approval, third-party payors, such as government or private health care insurers, carefully review and increasingly question the coverage of, and challenge the prices charged for, drugs. These and other similar developments could significantly limit the degree of market acceptance of lefamulin, CONTEPO or any of our other product candidates that receive marketing approval. 
           If we are unable to establish or maintain sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or enter into or maintain sales, marketing and distribution agreements with third parties, we may not be successful in commercializing lefamulin, CONTEPO or any other product candidate if and when they are approved. 
         We have only a very limited sales, marketing, patient access and distribution infrastructure, and as a company we have no experience in the sale, marketing or distribution of pharmaceutical products. To achieve commercial success for any approved product, we must either establish an adequate sales, marketing, patient access and distribution organization or outsource these functions to third parties. If lefamulin or CONTEPO receives marketing approval, we plan to commercialize it in the United States with our own targeted hospital sales and marketing organization that we plan to expand beyond its current levels, subject to our ability to access additional capital. In addition, we expect to utilize a 
 73

   variety of types of collaboration, distribution and other marketing arrangements with one or more third parties to commercialize lefamulin in markets outside the United States. We do not intend to seek approval to commercialize CONTEPO in any markets outside the United States. 
         There are risks involved with establishing our own sales, marketing, patient access and distribution capabilities and entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services. If we do not establish adequate sales, marketing, patient access and distribution capabilities prior to or in connection with the commercial launch of any of our products, such products may fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community and may fail commercially or be less successful than we expect. If the commercial launch of a product candidate for which we establish marketing and distribution capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel. 
         Factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our products on our own include:
 

 our inability to recruit, train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales, patient access and marketing personnel; 
 the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe any future products; 
 the lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put our sales representatives at a competitive disadvantage
relative to sales representatives from companies with more extensive product lines; and 
 unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales, marketing, patient access and distribution organization. 

         If we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing, patient access and distribution services, our product revenues or the profitability of these product revenues to us are likely to be lower than if we were to market, sell and distribute ourselves any products that we develop. In addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell, market and distribute our product candidates or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable to us. We likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively. If we do not establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our product candidates. 
           We face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do. 
         The development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to lefamulin, CONTEPO and any other products we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization. 
         There are a variety of available therapies marketed for the treatment of CABP and cUTI. Currently the treatment of CABP and cUTI is dominated by generic products. For hospitalized patients, combination therapy is frequently used in both CABP and cUTI. Many currently approved drugs are well-established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party 
 74

   payors for the treatment of CABP. We also are aware of various drugs under development or recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of CABP, including omadacycline (recently approved by the FDA on behalf of Paratek Pharmaceuticals Inc.), delafloxacin (recently approved by the FDA for ABSSSI on behalf of Melinta Therapeutics Inc. with a completed phase 3 clinical trial for CABP) and oral nafithromycin (under Phase 2 clinical development by Wockhardt Ltd.). If approved, we expect CONTEPO will face competition from commercially available branded antibiotics such as ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, tigecycline and plazomicin, from other products currently in development for the treatment of cUTI, including AP, such as imipenem-relebactam (under Phase 3 clinical development by Merck), cefiderocol (under Phase 3 clinical development by Shionogi), ETX0282-cefpodoxime proxetil (under Phase 1 clinical development by Entasis Therapeutics), and LYS228 (under development by Novartis), as well as generically available agents including piperacillin-tazobactam, carbapenems, aminoglycosides, and polymyxins. 
         Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are approved for broader indications or patient populations, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors may also obtain marketing approvals for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected because in some cases insurers or other third-party payors seek to encourage the use of generic products. This may have the effect of making branded products less attractive, from a cost perspective, to buyers. We expect that if lefamulin is approved for CABP and CONTEPO is approved for cUTI, including AP, they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products. This pricing difference may make it difficult for us to replace existing therapies with lefamulin and CONTEPO. The key competitive factors affecting the success of our product candidates are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 
         Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining approvals from regulatory authorities and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller and other early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to or necessary for our programs. 
           Even if we are able to commercialize lefamulin, CONTEPO or any other product candidate that we develop, the product may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, which would harm our business. 
         The regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing, coverage and reimbursement for new drug products vary widely from country to country. Current and future legislation may significantly change the approval requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain marketing approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, and negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country. Adverse pricing 
 75

   limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more product candidates, even if our product candidates obtain marketing approval. 
         Our ability to commercialize lefamulin, CONTEPO or any other product candidate successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and other third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. A major trend in the healthcare industries in the European Union and the United States and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for lefamulin, CONTEPO or any other product that we commercialize and, if coverage and reimbursement are available, the level of reimbursement. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. Obtaining and maintaining adequate reimbursement for lefamulin and CONTEPO may be particularly difficult because of the number of generic drugs, which are typically available at lower prices, that are available to treat CABP and cUTI. In addition, third-party payors are likely to impose strict requirements for reimbursement of a higher priced drug, such as lefamulin and CONTEPO. If reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize lefamulin, CONTEPO or other product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. 
         There may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the applicable regulatory authority. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs, and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. In the United States, third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. In the European Union, reference pricing systems and other measures may lead to cost containment and reduced prices. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition. 
           Product liability lawsuits against us could divert our resources, cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any products that we may develop or in-license. 
         We face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of lefamulin, CONTEPO and any other product candidate that we develop in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if we commercially sell any products that we may develop or in-license. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates or products caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:
 

 reduced resources of our management to pursue our business strategy; 

 76

   

 decreased demand for any product candidates or products that we may develop; 
 injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention; 
 withdrawal of clinical trial participants; 
 significant costs to defend the related litigation; 
 substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients; 
 loss of revenue; and 
 the inability to commercialize any products that we may develop. 

         We maintain clinical trial liability insurance that covers bodily injury to patients participating in our clinical trials up to a $10.0 million annual aggregate limit and subject to a per event deductible. This amount of insurance may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. We will need to increase our insurance coverage when and if we begin commercializing lefamulin, CONTEPO or any other product candidate that receives marketing approval. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise. 
   Risks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties 
           Use of third parties to manufacture our product candidates may increase the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates or products or such quantities at an acceptable quality or cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts. 
         We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of lefamulin or CONTEPO that could be used in product candidate development, including clinical trial supply, or for commercial supply, or for the supply of any other compound that we are developing or evaluating in our research program. We have limited personnel with experience in drug manufacturing and lack the resources and the capabilities to manufacture any of our product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. We currently rely on third parties for supply of lefamulin and CONTEPO, and our strategy is to outsource all manufacturing, packaging, testing, serialization and distribution of our product candidates and products to third parties. 
         We have entered into agreements, and expect to enter into additional agreements, with third-party manufacturers for the long-term commercial supply of lefamulin and CONTEPO. We obtained the pleuromutilin starting material for the clinical trial supply of lefamulin from a single third-party manufacturer, Sandoz GmbH, or Sandoz, a division of Novartis AG, or Novartis. Novartis stopped manufacturing pleuromutilin for us in June 2015 and will not be a commercial supplier of pleuromutilin for us. We have identified and entered into a commercial supply agreement with an alternative supplier that we believe will be able to provide pleuromutilin starting material for the commercial supply of lefamulin. 
         Another third-party manufacturer synthesizes lefamulin starting from pleuromutilin and a readily accessible chiral building block, and provides our supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredient. We may engage a secondary supplier to synthesize lefamulin. However, our current operating plans do not include a secondary supplier unless we obtain additional funding. We engage separate manufacturers to provide tablets, sterile vials, and sterile diluent that we are using in our clinical trials of lefamulin. We have entered into commercial supply agreements with these same manufacturers to support the future commercialization of lefamulin, if approved. We also entered into a long-term commercial supply agreement with Arran Chemical Company Limited, or Arran, for the supply of the chiral acid starting material required in the synthesis of lefamulin API and a commercial packaging and supply agreement with Sharp Corporation for the commercial packaging and of lefamulin. 
 77

           In addition, we have entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement with Ercros, S.A., pursuant to which Ercros, S.A. supplies to us, on an exclusive basis, the API mixture for CONTEPO in support of our NDA filing and, if CONTEPO is approved, will supply the commercial API Mixture for CONTEPO in the United State. We have also entered into a manufacturing and exclusive supply agreement with Laboratorios ERN, S.A., pursuant to which Laboratorios ERN, S.A. has agreed to supply us with certain technical documentation and data as required for our NDA filing for CONTEPO and certain regulatory support in connection with the commercial sale and use of CONTEPO in the United States. We entered into a commercial packaging agreement with AndersonBrecon, Inc. for the commercial packaging and serialization of CONTEPO in addition to a manufacturing and supply agreement with Fisiopharma S.r.l. for the supply, on a minimum commitment basis, of a percentage of our commercial requirements of CONTEPO in bulk drug vials for the United States as well as the supply of bulk drug vials of CONTEPO in connection with the submission of an NDA. 
         We may be unable to maintain our current arrangements for commercial supply, or conclude agreements for commercial supply with additional third-party manufacturers, or we may be unable to do so on acceptable terms. Even if we are able to establish and maintain arrangements with third-party manufacturers, reliance on third-party manufacturers entails additional risks, including:
 

 reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance; 
 an event at one of our manufacturers or suppliers causing an unforeseen disruption of the manufacture or supply of our product candidates; 
 the possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party; 
 the possible misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how; and 
 the possible termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us. 

         Third-party manufacturers may not be able to comply with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, regulations or similar regulatory requirements outside the United States. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our product candidates and products. 
         Our product candidates and any products that we may develop may compete with other product candidates and products for access to manufacturing facilities. There are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cGMP regulations and that might be capable of manufacturing for us. 
         If the third parties that we engage to supply any materials or manufacture product for our non-clinical testing and clinical trials should cease to continue to do so for any reason, we likely would experience delays in advancing these trials while we identify and qualify replacement suppliers, and we may be unable to obtain replacement supplies on terms that are favorable to us. For example, there are only a limited number of known manufacturers that produce the pleuromutilin starting material used in the synthesis of lefamulin. In early 2015, Novartis completed the sale of its animal health division, including its veterinary products, to a third party. As a result, we were required to identify an alternative supplier for pleuromutilin starting material for lefamulin. If we are not able to obtain adequate supplies of our product candidates or the drug substances used to manufacture them, it will be more difficult for us to develop our product candidates and compete effectively. 
 78

           Our current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to develop product candidates and commercialize any products that receive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis. 
           We rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials. 
         We do not independently conduct clinical trials for our product candidates. We rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to perform this function. We expect to continue to rely on such third parties in conducting our clinical trials of lefamulin and CONTEPO, and expect to rely on these third parties to conduct clinical trials of any other product candidate that we develop. Any of these third parties may terminate their engagements with us at any time. If we need to enter into alternative arrangements, it would delay our product development activities. 
         Our reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities but does not relieve us of our responsibilities. For example, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. Moreover, the FDA requires us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. We also are required to register ongoing clinical trials and post the results of completed clinical trials on a U.S. government-sponsored database, ClinicalTrials.gov, within certain timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions. Similar GCP and transparency requirements apply in the European Union. Failure to comply with such requirements, including with respect to clinical trials conducted outside the European Union, can also lead regulatory authorities to refuse to take into account clinical trial data submitted as part of an MAA. 
         Furthermore, third parties that we rely on for our clinical development activities may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, we will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing approvals for our product candidates and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our product candidates. Our product development costs will increase if we experience delays in testing or obtaining marketing approvals. 
         We also rely on other third parties to store and distribute drug supplies for our clinical trials. Any performance failure on the part of our distributors could delay clinical development or marketing approval of our product candidates or commercialization of our products, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue. 
           We have entered into and may enter into additional collaborations with third parties for the development or commercialization of lefamulin, CONTEPO and our other product candidates. If those collaborations are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of these product candidates. 
         If lefamulin and CONTEPO receive marketing approval, we plan to commercialize them in the United States with our own targeted hospital sales and marketing organization. Outside the United States, we expect to utilize a variety of types of collaboration, distribution and other marketing arrangements with one or more third parties to commercialize lefamulin. For example, we have entered into a license agreement with Sinovant pursuant to which we granted Sinovant certain rights to manufacture and commercialize lefamulin in the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macau and 
 79

   Taiwan. We also may seek third-party collaborators for development and commercialization of other product candidates or for lefamulin for indications other than CABP. 
         Our likely future collaborators for any sales, marketing, distribution, development, licensing or broader collaboration arrangements include large and mid-size pharmaceutical companies, regional and national pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies. Under our license agreement with Sinovant, we have, and under any such arrangements we enter into with any third parties in the future we will likely have, limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to the development or commercialization of our product candidates. Our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators' abilities and efforts to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements. 
         Our current collaborations involving our product candidates pose, and any future collaborations likely will pose, numerous risks to us, including the following:
 

 collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations and may not
perform their obligations as expected; 
 collaborators may deemphasize or not pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew
development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborators' strategic focus, product and product candidate priorities, available funding, or external
factors such as an acquisition that diverts resources or creates competing priorities; 
 collaborators may need to conduct clinical trials, and these clinical trials may not be successful; 
 collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product
candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing; 
 collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or
product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than
ours; 
 a collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more products may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and
distribution of such product or products; 
 collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to
invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation; 
 collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability; 
 disputes may arise between the collaborator and us as to the ownership of intellectual property arising during the collaboration; 
 we may grant exclusive rights to our collaborators, which would prevent us from collaborating with others; 
 collaborators may be unable to enforce our intellectual property rights in territories where we have licensed, or may license, them such
rights, which may expose us to material adverse tax and other consequences; 

 80

   

 disputes may arise between the collaborators and us that result in the delay or termination of the development or commercialization of our
products or product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources; and 
 collaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or
commercialization of the applicable product candidates. 

         For example, under our license agreement with Sinovant, if any court, tribunal or governmental agency in the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macau or Taiwan determines that the exclusive license granted to Sinovant pursuant to the license agreement is not sufficiently exclusive such that Sinovant does not have sufficient rights to enforce the licensed patent rights in such territories, we and our subsidiary, Nabriva Therapeutics GmbH, have agreed to take such commercially reasonable steps as Sinovant reasonably requests to grant Sinovant such rights. If a court in such jurisdictions were to determine that our license to Sinovant was not sufficiently exclusive and that Sinovant did not have the rights to enforce the licensed patent rights in the licensed territories, Sinovant may require us to take such actions that it deems reasonable but that we do not and which may have a material adverse effect on our business, including requiring us to make changes to our organizational structure that may result in adverse tax and other consequences, or to conduct other activities that may cause us to incur significant expenses. 
         Collaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of product candidates in the most efficient manner or at all. If a collaborator of ours were to be involved in a business combination, the continued pursuit and emphasis on our product development or commercialization program could be delayed, diminished or terminated. 
           If we are not able to establish additional collaborations, we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans. 
         The potential commercialization of lefamulin and CONTEPO and the development and potential commercialization of other product candidates will require substantial additional cash to fund expenses. For some of our product candidates, we may decide to further collaborate with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the development and potential commercialization of those product candidates. For example, we intend to seek to commercialize lefamulin through a variety of types of additional collaboration arrangements outside the United States. These collaborations will help fund the potential commercialization of our product candidates. 
         We face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Whether we reach a definitive agreement for additional collaborations outside greater China will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator's resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator's evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States, the potential market for the subject product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such product candidate to patients, the potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge, and industry and market conditions generally. The collaborator may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on and whether such a collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our product candidate. We may also be restricted under future license agreements from entering into agreements on certain terms with potential collaborators. Collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. In addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators. 
 81

           If we are unable to reach agreements with suitable collaborators on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, we may have to curtail the development of a product candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to fund and undertake development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we fail to enter into additional collaborations and do not have sufficient funds or expertise to undertake the necessary development and commercialization activities, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market and generate product revenue. 
   Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property 
           If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products, or if the scope of the patent protection is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be adversely affected. 
         Our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States, Europe and in certain additional foreign jurisdictions related to our novel technologies and product candidates that are important to our business. This process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Moreover, if we license technology or product candidates from third parties in the future, these license agreements may not permit us to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain or enforce the patents, covering this intellectual property. These agreements could also give our licensors the right to enforce the licensed patents without our involvement, or to decide not to enforce the patents at all. Therefore, in these circumstances, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. 
         The patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. 
         The laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. For example, European patent law restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than U.S. law does. We also may not pursue or obtain patent protection in all major markets or may not obtain protection that enables us to prevent the entry of third parties onto the market. Assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, currently, the first to file a patent application is generally entitled to the patent. However, prior to March 16, 2013, in the United States, the first to invent was entitled to the patent. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our U.S. patents or pending U.S. patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions.

        Moreover, we may be subject to a third-party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post grant review, interference proceedings or other patent office proceedings or litigation, in the United States or elsewhere, challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates. 
         Even if our patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or any future licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner. In addition, other companies may attempt to circumvent any regulatory data protection or market exclusivity that we obtain under applicable legislation, which may require us to allocate significant resources to preventing such circumvention. Legal and regulatory developments in the European Union and elsewhere may also result in clinical trial data submitted as part of an MAA becoming publicly available. Such developments could enable other companies to circumvent our intellectual property rights and use our clinical trial data to obtain marketing authorizations in the European Union and in other jurisdictions. Such developments may also require us to allocate significant resources to prevent other companies from circumventing or violating our intellectual property rights. Our attempts to prevent third parties from circumventing our intellectual property and other rights may ultimately be unsuccessful. We may also fail to take the required actions or pay the necessary fees to maintain our patents. 
         The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. 
           We may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful. 
         Competitors may infringe our patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property. To counter such infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file claims, which can be expensive and time consuming. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their intellectual property. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent's claims narrowly or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. 
 83

             Third parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business. 
         Our commercial success depends upon our ability and the ability of our collaborators to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the intellectual property and other proprietary rights of third parties. There is considerable intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and we may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology, including interference, derivation, inter partes review or post-grant review proceedings before the USPTO. The risks of being involved in such litigation and proceedings may increase as our product candidates approach commercialization, and as we gain greater visibility as a public company. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing or future intellectual property rights. We may not be aware of all such intellectual property rights potentially relating to our product candidates. Any freedom-to-operate search or analysis previously conducted may not have uncovered all relevant patents and patent applications, and there may be pending or future patent applications that, if issued, would block us from commercializing lefamulin or CONTEPO. Thus, we do not know with certainty whether lefamulin, CONTEPO or any other product candidate, or our commercialization thereof, does not and will not infringe any third party's intellectual property. 
         If we are found to infringe a third party's intellectual property rights, or to avoid or settle litigation, we could be required to obtain a license to continue developing and marketing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us, and could require us to make substantial payments. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys' fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent or other intellectual property right. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business. 
           We may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that we or our employees have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property. 
         Many of our employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee's former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. 
         In addition, while we typically require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. Our pleuromutilin business was founded as a spin-off from Sandoz. Although all patent applications are fully owned by us and were either filed by Sandoz with all rights fully transferred to us, or filed in our sole name, because we acquired certain of our patents from Sandoz, we must rely on their prior practices, with regard to the assignment of such intellectual property. Similarly, for any patent applications we acquired from Zavante in connection with the Acquisition, we must rely on Zavante's prior practices with regard to the assignment of 
 84

   intellectual property. Our and their assignment agreements may not be self-executing or may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property. 
         If we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. 
           Intellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and could distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities. 
         Even if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our ordinary shares. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development, sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. 
           If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed. 
         In addition to seeking patents for some of our technology and products, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. However, we cannot guarantee that we have executed these agreements with each party that may have or have had access to our trade secrets or that the agreements we have executed will provide adequate protection. Any party with whom we have executed such an agreement may breach that agreement and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be obtained or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed. 
           We have not yet registered our trademarks in all of our potential markets, and failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our business. 
         Our trademark applications may not be allowed for registration, and our registered trademarks may not be maintained or enforced. During trademark registration proceedings, we may receive rejections. Although we are given an opportunity to respond to those rejections, we may be unable to 
 85

   overcome such rejections. In addition, in the USPTO and in comparable agencies in many foreign jurisdictions, third parties are given an opportunity to oppose pending trademark applications and to seek to cancel registered trademarks. Opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our trademarks, and our trademarks may not survive such proceedings. If we do not secure registrations for our trademarks, we may encounter more difficulty in enforcing them against third parties than we otherwise would. 
   Risks Related to Regulatory Approval and Marketing of Our Product Candidates and Other Legal Compliance Matters 
           Even if we complete the necessary non-clinical studies and clinical trials, the marketing approval process is expensive, time-consuming and uncertain and may prevent us from obtaining approvals for the commercialization of some or all of our product candidates. If we are not able to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required regulatory approvals, in particular in the United States or the European Union, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates in those markets, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired. 
         Our product candidates, including lefamulin and CONTEPO, and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including their design, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and, in the case of lefamulin, by comparable authorities in other countries. Failure to obtain marketing approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate. We have not received approval to market lefamulin, CONTEPO or any of our other product candidates from regulatory authorities in any jurisdiction and we do not intend to seek approval to market CONTEPO outside the United States. 
         We have little experience in filing and supporting the applications necessary to obtain marketing approvals for product candidates and we have and expect to continue to rely on third-parties to assist us in this process. Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive non-clinical and clinical data and supporting information to various regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate's safety and efficacy. Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities. Regulatory authorities may determine that lefamulin, CONTEPO or any of our other product candidates are not effective or only moderately effective, or have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities, safety profiles or other characteristics that preclude us from obtaining marketing approval or that prevent or limit commercial use. 
         The process of obtaining marketing approvals is expensive, may take many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. Changes in marketing approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. For example, on June 23, 2016, eligible members of the electorate in the United Kingdom decided by referendum to leave the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit. On March 29, 2017, the United Kingdom formally notified the European Union of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. Because a significant proportion of the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom is derived from European Union directives and regulations, the referendum could materially change the regulatory regime applicable to the approval of any of our product candidates in the United Kingdom. In addition, because the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, is currently located in the United Kingdom but expected to move to the Netherlands as a result of the Brexit, the implications for the regulatory review process in the European Union has not been fully clarified and could result in disruption to the EMA review process. 
 86

           The United Kingdom has a period of a maximum of two years from the date of its formal notification to negotiate the terms of its withdrawal from, and future relationship with, the E.U. If no formal withdrawal agreement is reached between the United Kingdom and the E.U., then it is expected the United Kingdom's membership of the E.U. will automatically terminate two years after the submission of the notification of the United Kingdom's intention to withdraw from the E.U. Discussions between the United Kingdom and the E.U. focused on finalizing withdrawal issues and transition agreements are ongoing. However, limited progress to date in these negotiations and ongoing uncertainty within the UK Government and Parliament sustains the possibility of the United Kingdom leaving the E.U. on March 29, 2019 without a withdrawal agreement and associated transition period in place, which is likely to cause significant market and economic disruption. 
         The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in other countries have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data are insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from non-clinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of a product candidate. Any marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable. 
         Accordingly, if we or our collaborators experience delays in obtaining approval or if we or they fail to obtain approval of our product candidates, the commercial prospects for our product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate revenues will be materially impaired. 
           Our failure to obtain marketing approval in jurisdictions other than the United States and Europe would prevent our product candidates from being marketed in these other jurisdictions, and any approval we are granted for our product candidates in the United States and Europe would not assure approval of product candidates in other jurisdictions. 
         In order to market and sell lefamulin and our other product candidates in jurisdictions other than the United States and Europe, we must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval process varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval or approvals from regulatory authorities in the European Union. The regulatory approval process outside the United States and Europe generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval or approvals from regulatory authorities in the European Union. In addition, some countries outside the United States and Europe require approval of the sales price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, separate procedures must be followed to obtain reimbursement and a product may not be approved for sale in the country until it is also approved for reimbursement. We may not obtain marketing, pricing or reimbursement approvals outside the United States and Europe on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA or regulatory authorities in the European Union does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States and Europe does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA or regulatory authorities in the European Union. We may not be able to file for marketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market. Marketing approvals in countries outside the United States and Europe do not ensure pricing approvals in those countries or in any other countries, and marketing approvals and pricing approvals do not ensure that reimbursement will be obtained. 
 87

             Even if we obtain marketing approvals for our product candidates, the terms of approvals and ongoing regulation of our products may limit how we manufacture and market our products and compliance with such requirements may involve substantial resources, which could materially impair our ability to generate revenue. 
         Even if marketing approval of a product candidate is granted, an approved product and its manufacturer and marketer are subject to ongoing review and extensive regulation, including the potential requirements to implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy or to conduct costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. We must also comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Promotional communications with respect to prescription drugs are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the product's approved labeling. Thus, we will not be able to promote any products we develop for indications or uses for which they are not approved. In addition, manufacturers of approved products and those manufacturers' facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA requirements including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP, which include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and reporting requirements. We and our contract manufacturers could be subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA to monitor and ensure compliance with cGMP. 
         Accordingly, assuming we receive marketing approval for one or more of our product candidates, we and our contract manufacturers will continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, product surveillance and quality control. If we are not able to comply with post-approval regulatory requirements, we could have the marketing approvals for our products withdrawn by regulatory authorities and our ability to market any future products could be limited, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve or sustain profitability. Thus, the cost of compliance with post-approval regulations may have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition. 
           Any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval will be subject to strict enforcement of post-marketing requirements and we could be subject to substantial penalties, including withdrawal of our product from the market, if we fail to comply with all regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our product candidates, when and if any of them are approved. 
         Any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval, along with the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include, but are not limited to, restrictions governing promotion of an approved product, submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, cGMP requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, and requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. In addition, even if marketing approval of a product candidate is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval. 
         The FDA and other federal and state agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, closely regulate compliance with all requirements governing prescription drug products, including requirements pertaining to marketing and promotion of drugs in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling and manufacturing of products in accordance with cGMP requirements. The FDA and DOJ impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers' communications regarding off-label use and if we do not market our products for their approved indications, we may be subject to enforcement action for off-label marketing. Violations of such requirements may lead to investigations alleging violations of 
 88

   the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and other statutes, including the False Claims Act and other federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws as well as state consumer protection laws. 
         Our failure to comply with all regulatory requirements, and later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, may yield various results, including:
 

 litigation involving patients taking our products; 
 restrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes; 
 restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product; 
 restrictions on product distribution or use; 
 requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials; 
 warning or untitled letters; 
 withdrawal of the products from the market; 
 refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit; 
 recall of products; 
 fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues; 
 suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals; 
 damage to relationships with any potential collaborators; 
 unfavorable press coverage and damage to our reputation; 
 refusal to permit the import or export of our products; 
 product seizure; 
 exclusion from participation in federal healthcare reimbursement programs or debarment or the imposition of Corporate Integrity Agreements; or 
 injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

         Non-compliance by us or any future collaborator with regulatory requirements regarding safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance, and with requirements related to the development of products for the pediatric population, can also result in significant financial penalties. Similarly, failure to comply with regulatory requirements regarding the protection of personal information can also lead to significant penalties and sanctions. 
         Non-compliance with European Union requirements regarding safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance, and with requirements related to the development of products for the pediatric population, also can result in significant financial penalties. Similarly, failure to comply with the European Union's requirements regarding the protection of personal information can also lead to significant penalties and sanctions. 
           Inadequate funding for the FDA, the SEC and other government agencies could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner or otherwise prevent those agencies from performing normal business functions on which the operation of our business may rely, which could negatively impact our business. 
         The ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the 
 89

   payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of the SEC and other government agencies on which our operations may rely, including those that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. 
         Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years, the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA and the SEC, have had to furlough critical FDA, SEC and other government employees and stop critical activities. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Future government shutdowns could impact our ability to access the public markets and obtain necessary capital in order to properly capitalize and continue our operations. 
           Governments outside the United States tend to impose strict price controls, which may adversely affect our revenues, if any. 
         In some countries, particularly the member states of the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. Also, there can be considerable pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states and parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. In some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial or other studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies to obtain or maintain reimbursement or pricing approval. Publication of discounts by third-party payors or authorities may lead to further pressure on prices or reimbursement levels within the country of publication and other countries. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be adversely affected. 
           The FDA's agreement to a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, with respect to the study design of our first Phase 3 clinical trial of lefamulin for CABP does not guarantee any particular outcome from regulatory review, including ultimate approval, and may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process. 
         We reached agreement with the FDA in September 2015 on a SPA, which was later amended in April 2016, regarding the study design of our first Phase 3 clinical trial of lefamulin for the treatment of CABP. The SPA process is designed to facilitate the FDA's review and approval of drugs by allowing the FDA to evaluate the proposed design and size of Phase 3 clinical trials that are intended to form the primary basis for determining a product candidate's efficacy and safety. Upon specific request by a clinical trial sponsor, the FDA will evaluate the protocol and respond to a sponsor's questions regarding, among other things, primary efficacy endpoints, trial conduct and data analysis, within 45 days of receipt of the request. The FDA ultimately assesses whether the protocol design and planned analysis of the trial are acceptable to support regulatory approval of the product candidate with respect to the effectiveness in the indication studied. 
         Our agreement with the FDA regarding the SPA may not lead to faster development, regulatory review or approval for lefamulin. Once the FDA and an applicant reach an agreement under the special protocol assessment process regarding the design and size of a clinical trial, the agreement generally cannot be changed after the clinical trial begins. Nevertheless, the FDA may revoke or alter a 
 90

   SPA under defined circumstances, such as changes in the relevant data or assumptions provided by the sponsor or the emergence of new public health concerns. A revocation or alteration in our SPA could significantly delay or prevent approval of any marketing applications we submit for lefamulin. 
           Fast track designation by the FDA may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process and does not assure FDA approval of our product candidate. 
         If a drug is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and the drug demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical need for this condition, the drug sponsor may apply for FDA fast track designation. The FDA has designated each of the IV and oral formulations of lefamulin and the IV formulation of CONTEPO as a qualified infectious disease product, or QIDP, and granted fast track designations to each of these formulations of lefamulin and CONTEPO. However, neither the QIDP nor the fast track designation ensures that lefamulin or CONTEPO will receive marketing approval or that approval will be granted within any particular timeframe. We have sought fast track designation for oral and IV lefamulin, as well as IV CONTEPO. We may, however, not experience a faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. In addition, the FDA may withdraw fast track designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program. Fast track designation alone does not guarantee qualification for the FDA's priority review procedures. 
           Priority review designation by the FDA may not lead to a faster regulatory review or approval process and, in any event, does not assure FDA approval of our product candidate. 
         If the FDA determines that a product candidate offers major advances in treatment or provides a treatment where no adequate therapy exists, the FDA may designate the product candidate for priority review. A priority review designation means that the FDA's goal to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review period of ten months. We were notified by the FDA that CONTEPO IV and the IV and oral formulations of lefamulin were granted priority review and have been given a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, target action date of April 30, 2019 and August 19, 2019, respectively. Because the FDA designated each of the IV and oral formulations of lefamulin as a QIDP, lefamulin also will receive priority review. We may also request priority review for other product candidates. The FDA has broad discretion with respect to whether or not to grant priority review status to a product candidate, so even if we believe a particular product candidate is eligible for such designation or status, the FDA may decide not to grant it. Moreover, a priority review designation does not necessarily mean a faster regulatory review process or necessarily confer any advantage with respect to approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. Receiving priority review from the FDA does not guarantee approval within the six-month review cycle or thereafter. 
           Designation of each of lefamulin and CONTEPO as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product does not assure FDA approval of these product candidates. 
         A QIDP is an antibacterial or antifungal drug intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections, including those caused by an antibacterial or antifungal resistant pathogen, including novel or emerging infectious pathogens or certain "qualifying pathogens." Upon the approval of an NDA for a drug product designated by the FDA as a QIDP, the product is granted an additional period of five years of regulatory exclusivity. Even though we have received QIDP designation for the IV and oral formulations of lefamulin and IV formulation of CONTEPO, there is no assurance that these product candidates will be approved by the FDA. 
 91

             If the FDA does not conclude that our product candidates satisfy the requirements under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetics Act, or if the requirements for such product candidates under Section 505(b)(2) are not as we expect, the approval pathway for those product candidates may take longer, cost more and entail greater complications and risks than anticipated, and may not be successful. 
         We submitted an NDA for marketing approval of CONTEPO for the treatment of cUTI in adults in the United States in October 2018 utilizing Section 505(b)(2) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, which was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, otherwise known as the Hatch-Waxman Act. Section 505(b)(2) permits the submission of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. 
         For NDAs submitted under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, the patent certification and related provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act apply. In accordance with the Hatch-Waxman Act, such NDAs may be required to include certifications, known as Paragraph IV certifications, that certify any patents listed in the Orange Book publication in respect to any product referenced in the 505(b)(2) application are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of the product that is the subject of the 505(b)(2) application. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, the holder of the NDA which the 505(b)(2) application references may file a patent infringement lawsuit after receiving notice of the Paragraph IV certification. Filing of a patent infringement lawsuit triggers a one-time automatic 30-month stay of the FDA's ability to approve the 505(b)(2) application. We have not conducted a comprehensive freedom-to-operate review with regard to CONTEPO. 
         Accordingly, we may invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of CONTEPO or any other product candidate we may develop and experience significant delays and patent litigation before such products may be commercialized, if at all. A Section 505(b)(2) application also may not be approved until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. The FDA may also require us to perform one or more additional clinical studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new formulation for all or only some of the indications sought by us. The FDA may also reject our future Section 505(b)(2) submissions and may require us to file such submissions under Section 501(b)(1) of the FDCA, which could be considerably more expensive and time consuming. 
         In addition, notwithstanding the approval of a number of products by the FDA under Section 505(b)(2) over the last few years, certain competitors and others have objected to the FDA's interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). If the FDA's interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) is successfully challenged, the FDA may be required to change its 505(b)(2) policies and practices, which could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any NDA that we submit under Section 505(b)(2). It is not uncommon for a manufacturer of an approved product to file a citizen petition with the FDA seeking to delay approval of, or impose additional approval requirements for, pending competing products. If successful, such petitions can significantly delay, or even prevent, the approval of the new product. However, even if the FDA ultimately denies such a petition, the FDA may substantially delay approval while it considers and responds to the petition. Thus, even if we are able to utilize the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, there is no guarantee this would ultimately lead to faster product development or earlier approval. 
         If the FDA does not conclude that CONTEPO, or any of our other product candidates for which we may utilize the 505(b)(2) pathway, satisfies the requirements for the 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway, or if the requirements for approval of any of our product candidates, including CONTEPO, under Section 505(b)(2) are not as we expect, the approval pathway for CONTEPO and any of our other product candidates for which we may utilize the 505(b)(2) pathway will likely take significantly 
 92

   longer, cost significantly more and encounter significantly greater complications and risks than anticipated, and in any case may not be successful. 
           Under the CURES Act and the Trump Administration's regulatory reform initiatives, the FDA's policies, regulations and guidance may be revised or revoked and that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates, which would impact our ability to generate revenue. 
         In December 2016, the Cures Act was signed into law. The Cures Act, among other things, is intended to modernize the regulation of drugs and spur innovation, but its ultimate implementation is unclear. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. 
         We also cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad. For example, certain policies of the Trump administration may impact our business and industry. Namely, the Trump administration has taken several executive actions, including the issuance of a number of Executive Orders, that could impose significant burdens on, or otherwise materially delay, the FDA's ability to engage in routine regulatory and oversight activities such as implementing statutes through rulemaking, issuance of guidance, and review and approval of marketing applications. An under-staffed FDA could result in delays in the FDA's responsiveness or in its ability to review submissions or applications, issue regulations or guidance, or implement or enforce regulatory requirements in a timely fashion or at all. Moreover, on January 30, 2017, President Trump issued an Executive Order, applicable to all executive agencies, including the FDA, which requires that for each notice of proposed rulemaking or final regulation to be issued in fiscal year 2017, the agency shall identify at least two existing regulations to be repealed, unless prohibited by law. These requirements are referred to as the "two-for-one" provisions. For fiscal years 2018 and beyond, the Executive Order requires agencies to identify regulations to offset any incremental cost of a new regulation and approximate the total costs or savings associated with each new regulation or repealed regulation. In interim guidance issued by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs within the Office of Management and Budget on February 2, 2017, the administration indicates that the "two-for-one" provisions may apply not only to agency regulations, but also to significant agency guidance documents. In addition, on February 24, 2017, President Trump issued an executive order directing each affected agency to designate an agency official as a "Regulatory Reform Officer" and establish a "Regulatory Reform Task Force" to implement the two-for-one provisions and other previously issued executive orders relating to the review of federal regulations, however it is difficult to predict how these requirements will be implemented, and the extent to which they will impact the FDA's ability to exercise its regulatory authority. If these executive actions impose constraints on the FDA's ability to engage in oversight and implementation activities in the normal course, our business may be negatively impacted. 
           Our relationships with healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which in the event of a violation could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings. 
         Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates, including lefamulin and CONTEPO, for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through 
 93

   which we market, sell and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:
 

 the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or
providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation or
arranging of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid; 
 the federal False Claims Act imposes criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against
individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal healthcare program or making a false statement or
record material to payment of a false claim or avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government, with potential liability including mandatory treble damages and
significant per-claim penalties, currently set at $5,500 to $11,000 per false claim; 
 the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme
to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 
 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, also imposes
obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; 
 the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires applicable manufacturers of covered products to report payments and other transfers of
value to physicians and teaching hospitals, with data collection beginning in August 2013; and 
 analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws and transparency statutes, may apply to
sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third party payors, including private insurers. 

         Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and may require product manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
         If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our financial results. We are developing and implementing a corporate compliance program designed to ensure that we will market and sell any future products that we successfully develop from our product candidates in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, but we cannot guarantee that this program will protect us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions. 
 94

           Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion of products from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs. 
           Current and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us and any future collaborators to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices we, or they, may obtain. 
         In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could, among other things, prevent or delay marketing approval of lefamulin, CONTEPO or any of our other product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability, or the ability of any collaborators, to profitably sell any product candidates, including lefamulin and CONTEPO, for which we, or they, obtain marketing approval. We expect that current laws, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we, or any future collaborators, may receive for any approved products. 
         In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA. Among the provisions of the ACA of potential importance to our business and our product candidates are the following:
 

 an annual, non-deductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription products and biologic agents; 
 an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; 
 expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the civil False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, new government
investigative powers and enhanced penalties for noncompliance; 
 a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off
negotiated prices; 
 extension of manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability; 
 expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; 
 expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program; 
 new requirements to report certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals; 
 a new requirement to annually report product samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians; and 

 95

   

 a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research,
along with funding for such research. 

         In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include the Budget Control Act of 2011, which among other things, led to aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year that started in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statutes, will stay in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken, and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used. Further, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. 
         We expect that these healthcare reforms, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria, new payment methodologies and additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product and/or the level of reimbursement physicians receive for administering any approved product we might bring to market. Reductions in reimbursement levels may negatively impact the prices we receive or the frequency with which our products are prescribed or administered. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. Since enactment of the ACA, there have been numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. 
         Congress has repeatedly tried to repeal, replace and amend the ACA in recent years. With enactment of the legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was signed by the President on December 22, 2017, Congress repealed the "individual mandate" for the ACA. The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, became effective in 2019. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the repeal of the individual mandate will cause 13 million fewer Americans to be insured in 2027 and premiums in insurance markets may rise. Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called "Cadillac" tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the "donut hole." Further, each chamber of the Congress has put forth multiple bills designed to repeal or repeal and replace portions of the ACA. Although none of these measures has been enacted by Congress to date, Congress may consider other legislation to repeal and replace elements of the ACA. 
         The Trump Administration has also taken executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the ACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. One Executive Order directs federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on 
 96

   states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. The second Executive Order terminates the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the ACA. Several state Attorneys Generals filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017. In addition, CMS has recently proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. Further, on June 14, 2018, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than $12 billion in ACA risk corridor payments to third-party payors who argued were owed to them. The effects of this gap in reimbursement on third-party payors, the viability of the ACA marketplace, providers, and potentially our business, are not yet known. 
         We will continue to evaluate the effect that the ACA and its possible repeal and replacement could have on our business. It is possible that repeal and replacement initiatives, if enacted into law, could ultimately result in fewer individuals having health insurance coverage or in individuals having insurance coverage with less generous benefits. While the timing and scope of any potential future legislation to repeal and replace ACA provisions is highly uncertain in many respects, it is also possible that some of the ACA provisions that generally are not favorable for the research-based pharmaceutical industry could also be repealed along with ACA coverage expansion provisions. Accordingly, such reforms, if enacted, could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenue from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain marketing approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop commercialize product candidates. 
         Further, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, the Trump administration's budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. While any proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. 
         In addition, on May 11, 2018, the Administration issued a plan to lower drug prices. Under this blueprint for action, the Administration indicated that the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, will take steps to end the gaming of regulatory and patent processes by drug makers to unfairly protect monopolies; advance biosimilars and generics to boost price competition; evaluate the inclusion of prices in drug makers' advertisements to enhance price competition; speed access to and lower the cost of new drugs by clarifying policies for sharing information between insurers and drug makers; avoid excessive pricing by relying more on value-based pricing by expanding outcome-based 
 97

   payments in Medicare and Medicaid; work to give Part D plan sponsors more negotiation power with drug makers; examine which Medicare Part B drugs could be negotiated for a lower price by Part D plans, and improving the design of the Part B Competitive Acquisition Program; update Medicare's drug-pricing dashboard to increase transparency; prohibit Part D contracts that include "gag rules" that prevent pharmacists from informing patients when they could pay less out-of-pocket by not using insurance; and require that Part D plan members be provided with an annual statement of plan payments, out-of-pocket spending, and drug price increases. 
         At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. 
         Moreover, legislative and regulatory proposals have also been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical drugs. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our drug candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the United States Congress of the FDA's approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us and any future collaborators to more stringent drug labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements. 
           We are subject to anti-corruption laws, as well as export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations. If we fail to comply with these laws, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, other remedial measures and legal expenses, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
         Our operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, the Irish Criminal Justice (Corruption Offenses) Act, and other anti-corruption laws that apply in countries where we do business and may do business in the future. The FCPA and these other laws generally prohibit us, our officers, and our employees and intermediaries from bribing, being bribed or making other prohibited payments to government officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage. We may in the future operate in jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential FCPA violations, and we may participate in collaborations and relationships with third parties whose actions could potentially subject us to liability under the FCPA or local anti-corruption laws. In addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in that existing laws might be administered or interpreted. 
         Compliance with the FCPA is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions. 
         We are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations, including regulations administered by the governments of the United States, and authorities in the European 
 98

   Union, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions on countries and persons, customs requirements and currency exchange regulations, collectively referred to as the trade control laws. 
         There is no assurance that we will be effective in ensuring our compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA or other legal requirements, including trade control laws. If we are not in compliance with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws or trade control laws, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Likewise, any investigation of any potential violations of the FCPA, other anti-corruption laws or trade control laws by U.S. or other authorities could also have an adverse impact on our reputation, our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
           If we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business. 
         We are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations currently, and may in the future, involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and medical and biological materials, and produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes, we cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials or disposal of hazardous wastes, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. 
         Although we maintain workers' compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We also maintain a general liability program for some of the risks, but our insurance program includes limited environmental damage coverage, which has an annual aggregate coverage limit of $2.0 million. Although we maintain an umbrella policy with an annual aggregate coverage limit of $10.0 million, which may provide some environmental coverage, we do not maintain a separate policy covering environmental damages. 
         In addition, we may incur substantial costs to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions. 
           Our employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could cause significant liability for us and harm our reputation. 
         We are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct, including intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations or similar regulations of comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities, provide accurate information to the FDA or comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities, comply with manufacturing standards we have established, comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations and similar laws and regulations established and enforced by comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. 
 99



        Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained during clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws, standards or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions. 
           We rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cyber security incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively. 
         Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of third parties with which we contract are vulnerable to damage from cyber-attacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. System failures, accidents or security breaches could cause interruptions in our operations, and could result in a material disruption of our drug development programs and commercialization activities and business operations, in addition to possibly requiring substantial expenditures of resources to remedy. The loss of clinical trial data could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and our product research, development and commercialization efforts could be delayed. 
           We are subject to various laws protecting the confidentiality of certain patient health information, and our failure to comply could result in penalties and reputational damage. 
         Certain countries in which we operate have, or are developing, laws protecting the confidentiality of certain patient health information. European Union member states and other jurisdictions have adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. 
         For example, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, which came into force on May 25, 2018, introduced new data protection requirements in the European Union and substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules. The GDPR imposes strict obligations and restrictions on controllers and processors of personal data including, for example, expanded disclosures about how personal data is to be used, increased requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data, mandatory data breach notification requirements and expanded rights for individuals over their personal data. This could affect our ability to collect, analyze and transfer personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting, or could cause our costs to increase, and harm our business and financial condition. 
         While the GDPR, as a directly effective regulation, was designed to harmonize data protection law across the European Union, it does permit member states to legislate in many areas (particularly with regard to the processing of genetic, biometric or health data), meaning that inconsistencies between different member states will still arise. European Union member states have their own regimes on medical confidentiality and national and European Union-level guidance on implementation and compliance practices is often updated or otherwise revised, which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in the European Union.

     Risks Related to Our Acquisition of Zavante 
           We may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of our Acquisition of Zavante, those benefits may take longer to realize than expected, and we may encounter significant integration difficulties. 
         On July 24, 2018, we completed our acquisition, or the Acquisition, of Zavante Therapeutics, Inc., or Zavante, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, dated July 23, 2018. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate Zavante and CONTEPO into our business and business strategy and realize anticipated growth opportunities and synergies. We expect that the integration process will be complex, costly and time-consuming. As a result, we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating Zavante into our business and CONTEPO into our business strategy. The integration process may be disruptive to our business and the expected benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. The failure to meet the challenges involved and to realize the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, our development and commercialization efforts, including with respect to lefamulin and CONTEPO, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
         Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition is expected to entail numerous additional material potential difficulties, including, among others:
 

 any delay or failure in obtaining marketing approvals for CONTEPO, or any delay or failure to commercialize CONTEPO in the United States
thereafter; 
 increased scrutiny from third parties, including regulators, legislative bodies and enforcement agencies, including with respect to product
pricing and commercialization matters; 
 changes in laws or regulations that adversely impact the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition; 
 challenges related to the perception by patients, the medical community and third-party payors of CONTEPO for the treatment of complicated
urinary tract infections, or cUTIs; 
 disruptions to our manufacturing arrangements with third-party manufacturers, including our manufacturing and supply arrangements with respect
to CONTEPO and disruptions to our third-party distribution channel; 
 difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a larger and more complex company following the Acquisition; 
 the diversion of management attention to integration matters; 
 difficulties in achieving the anticipated business opportunities and growth prospects from the Acquisition; 
 the size of the treatable patient population for CONTEPO may be smaller than we believe it is; 
 difficulties in assimilating Zavante employees and in attracting and retaining key personnel; and 
 potential unknown liabilities, adverse consequences, unforeseen increased expenses or other unanticipated problems associated with the
Acquisition. 

         Many of these factors are outside of our control, and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreased expected revenues and further diversion of management time and energy, which could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
         Upfront consideration for the Acquisition was comprised of 8,152,092 of our ordinary shares, including the 815,186 ordinary shares that are issuable upon release of the Holdback Shares subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, former Zavante stockholders are also entitled to receive from us, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, up

   to $97.5 million in contingent consideration, of which $25.0 million would become payable upon the first approval of a new drug application from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, for CONTEPO for injection for any indication, or the Approval Milestone Payment, and an aggregate of up to $72.5 million would become payable upon the achievement of specified net sales milestones, or the Net Sales Milestone Payments. At our Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders held in October 2018, our shareholders approved the issuance of ordinary shares in settlement of potential milestone payment obligations that may become payable in the future to former Zavante stockholders, including the Approval Milestone Payment which will be settled in our ordinary shares. We also now have the right to settle the Net Sales Milestone Payments in ordinary shares, except as otherwise provided in the Merger Agreement. The issuance of our ordinary shares in connection with the closing of the Acquisition was dilutive to our existing shareholders, and the future issuance of our ordinary shares to satisfy our milestone payment obligations would be further dilutive to our then existing shareholders. 
         Also, following the Acquisition, we now possess certain liabilities and obligations, including contractual liabilities and obligations, that were assumed by us upon closing of the Acquisition. Prior to the Acquisition, former Zavante stockholders and SG Pharmaceuticals, Inc. entered into a stock purchase agreement, dated as of May 5, 2015, or the Stock Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which SG Pharmaceuticals, Inc. acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Zavante from the Zavante selling stockholders and SG Pharmaceuticals, Inc., subsequently merged with and into Zavante, with Zavante as the surviving entity. Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, Zavante (as successor to SG Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) is obligated to make milestone payments to the selling stockholders of $3.0 million upon marketing approval by the FDA with respect to any oral, intravenous or other form of fosfomycin, or the Zavante Products, and milestone payments of up to $26.0 million in the aggregate upon the occurrence of various specified levels of net sales with respect to the Zavante Products. In addition, Zavante is obligated to make annual royalty payments to the selling stockholders of a mid-single-digit percentage of net sales of Zavante Products, subject to adjustment based on net sales thresholds and with such percentage reduced to low single-digits if generic fosfomycin products account for half of the applicable market on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis. The Stock Purchase Agreement also provides that Zavante will pay to the selling stockholders a mid-single-digit percentage of transaction revenue in connection with the consummation of the grant, sale, license or transfer of market exclusivity rights for a qualified infectious disease product (within the meaning of the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act) related to a Zavante Product. 
         In addition, we expect to incur expenses related to the continued development, regulatory approval process and commercialization with respect to CONTEPO. Zavante has entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement with Fisiopharma, S.r.l. pursuant to which Zavante has an obligation to purchase a minimum percentage of its commercial requirements of CONTEPO in the United States. Zavante has also entered into a manufacturing and exclusive supply agreement with Laboratorios ERN, S.A., pursuant to which Laboratorios ERN, S.A. has agreed to supply Zavante with certain technical documentation and data as required for submission of an NDA, or ANDA for CONTEPO and certain regulatory support in connection with the commercial sale and use of CONTEPO in the United States, and which provides for payments to Laboratorios ERN, S.A. of a one-time cash payment upon the first commercial sale of CONTEPO and subsequent quarterly payments thereafter based on the number of vials of CONTEPO sold in the United States during each quarter. 
         Because we have limited financial resources, by investing in the Acquisition, we may forgo or delay pursuit of other opportunities that may have proven to have greater commercial potential. Further, it is possible that undisclosed, contingent, or other liabilities or problems may arise in the future of which we were previously unaware. These undisclosed liabilities could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 102

           All of these factors could decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the Acquisition and negatively impact our stock price. As a result, it cannot be assured that the Acquisition will result in the full realization of the benefits anticipated from the Acquisition or in the anticipated time frames or at all. 
   Risks Related to Employee Matters and Managing Growth 
           Our future success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate key executives and qualified personnel. 
         We are highly dependent on the principal members of our management and commercial teams. Although we have formal employment agreements with each of our executive officers, these agreements do not prevent our executives from terminating their employment with us at any time. We do not maintain "key person" insurance on any of our executive officers. The unplanned loss of the services of any of these persons might impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives. 
         Recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, clinical, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel, including in the United States and Ireland where we plan to expand our physical presence, will also be critical to our success. We may not be able to attract and retain these personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us. If we cannot recruit and retain qualified personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop our product candidates, conduct our clinical trials and commercialize our product candidates. 
           We expect to expand the number of our employees and the scope of our operations in the certain areas, and as a result, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations. 
         We expect to experience significant growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations, particularly in the areas of regulatory affairs, technical operations, supply chain, medical affairs and, subject to obtaining marketing approval of lefamulin and CONTEPO, sales and marketing. To manage our anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. In addition, our growth in connection with the Acquisition, including expansion of our business operations and employees who joined us in connection with the Acquisition, has imposed added responsibilities on members of our management, including the need to recruit, hire, retain, motivate and integrate additional employees and business operations. 
         Due to our limited financial resources and the limited experience of our management team in managing a company of our current size, and with such anticipated growth, we may not be able to manage the future expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. The expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations. 
   Risks Related to Ownership of Our Ordinary Shares 
           An active trading market for our ordinary shares may not be sustained. 
         Our ordinary shares began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market on June 26, 2017. Given the limited trading history of our ordinary shares, there is a risk that an active trading market for our 
 103

   ordinary shares will not be sustained, which could put downward pressure on the market price of our ordinary shares and thereby affect the ability of our security holders to sell their shares. 
           The price of our ordinary shares may be volatile and fluctuate substantially. 
         The trading price of our ordinary shares has been and is likely to continue to be volatile. The stock market in general and the market for smaller biopharmaceutical companies in particular have experienced significant volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The market price for our ordinary shares may be influenced by many factors, including:
 

 our ability to successfully implement our proposed business strategy; 
 the success of competitive products or technologies; 
 results of clinical trials of our product candidates or those of our competitors; 
 regulatory delays and greater government regulation of potential products due to adverse events; 
 regulatory or legal developments in the United States, the European Union and other countries; 
 developments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights; 
 the recruitment or departure of key scientific or management personnel; 
 the level of expenses related to any of our product candidates or clinical development programs; 
 the results of our efforts to discover, develop, acquire or in-license additional product candidates or products; 
 one of our manufacturers or suppliers could have an event which causes an unforeseen disruption of the manufacture or supply of our product
candidates; 
 actual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts; 
 variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us; 
 perception and market performance of companies that are perceived to be similar to us:
 changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems; 
 market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors; 
 general economic, industry and market conditions; and 
 the other factors described in this "Risk Factors" section. 

         In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against that company. We also may face securities class-action litigation if we cannot obtain regulatory approvals for or if we otherwise fail to commercialize lefamulin, CONTEPO or any of our other product candidates or if our securities experience volatility for any reason. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could cause us to incur substantial costs to defend such claims and divert management's attention and resources. 
           Our executive officers, directors and principal shareholders, if they choose to act together, have the ability to significantly influence most matters submitted to shareholders for approval. 
         Our executive officers and directors, combined with our shareholders, and their respective affiliates who owned more than 5% of our outstanding ordinary shares as of January 31, 2019 in the aggregate, 
 104

   beneficially owned approximately 38.4% of our share capital, assuming the issuance of all Holdback Shares under the Merger Agreement. As a result, if these shareholders were to choose to act together, they would be able to significantly influence most matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, as well as our management and affairs. For example, these persons, if they choose to act together, would significantly influence the election of directors and could, depending on the structure of the particular transaction, significantly influence the approval of a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. 
           Our ordinary shares do not trade on any exchange outside of the United States. 
         Our ordinary shares are listed only in the United States on The Nasdaq Global Market, and we have no plans to list our ordinary shares in any other jurisdiction. As a result, a holder of ordinary shares outside of the United States may not be able to effect transactions in our ordinary shares as readily as the holder may if our ordinary shares were listed on an exchange in that holder's home jurisdiction. 
           Substantial future sales of our ordinary shares in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the price of our ordinary shares to decline significantly, even if our business is doing well. 
         Sales of a substantial number of our ordinary shares, or the perception in the market that these sales could occur, could reduce the market price of our ordinary shares. We had 67,019,094 ordinary shares outstanding as of December 31, 2018. To the extent any of these shares are sold into the market, particularly in substantial quantities, the market price of our ordinary shares could decline. 
         Future issuances of ordinary shares pursuant to our equity incentive plans could also result in a reduction in the market price of our ordinary shares. We have filed registration statements on Form S-8 registering all of the ordinary shares that we may issue under our equity compensation plans. These shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance and once vested, subject to volume, notice and manner of sale limitations applicable to affiliates. The majority of ordinary shares that may be issued under our equity compensation plans remain subject to vesting in tranches over a four-year period. As of December 31, 2018, an aggregate of 1,963,877 options to purchase our ordinary shares had vested and become exercisable. No restricted stock units have vested as of December 31, 2018. 
         In addition, in March 2018, we entered into a Controlled Equity OfferingSM Sales Agreement, or the ATM Agreement, with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., or Cantor, pursuant to which, from time to time, we may offer and sell our ordinary shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $50.0 million through Cantor. As of December 31, 2018, we had issued and sold an aggregate of 4,778,031 ordinary shares under the ATM Agreement. From December 31, 2018 through March 1, 2019 , we issued and sold an aggregate of 2,748,048 ordinary shares under the ATM Agreement. 
         If a large number of our ordinary shares are sold in the public market after they become eligible for sale, the sales could reduce the trading price of our ordinary shares and impede our ability to raise future capital. 
         Upfront consideration for the Acquisition is comprised of 8,152,092 of our ordinary shares, including 815,186 ordinary shares that are issuable upon release of the Holdback Shares subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement. The shares that were issued in connection with the closing of the Acquisition are able to be freely sold in the public market, subject to any requirements and restrictions, including any applicable volume limitations, imposed by Rule 144 under the Securities Act. While the Holdback Shares will be restricted as a result of securities laws at the time of issuance, following expiration of applicable holding periods, the Holdback Shares will also be able to be freely sold in the public market, subject to any requirements and restrictions, including any applicable volume limitations, imposed by Rule 144 under the Securities Act. In addition, the Merger Agreement provides that we 
 105

   may issue up to an additional $97.5 million in our ordinary shares to former Zavante stockholders upon the achievement of specified regulatory and commercial milestones in the future and obligates us to provide registration rights with respect to the registration for resale of such additional ordinary shares that may become issuable upon the achievement of such milestones. 
         The sale or resale of these shares in the public market, or the market's expectation of such sales, may result in an immediate and substantial decline in our stock price. Such a decline will adversely affect our investors and also might make it difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. 
           We are an "emerging growth company", and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our ordinary shares less attractive to investors. 
         We are an "emerging growth company," as that term is used in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and may remain an emerging growth company until December 31, 2020 or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:
 

 an exemption from compliance with the auditor attestation requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, on the design and effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting; 
 an exemption from compliance with any requirement that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board may adopt regarding mandatory audit firm
rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements; 
 reduced disclosure about the company's executive compensation arrangements; and 
 exemptions from the requirements to obtain a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation or a shareholder approval of any golden
parachute arrangements. 

         We may choose to take advantage of some, but not all, of the available exemptions. We may take advantage of these provisions until December 31, 2020 or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earlier to occur of: the last day of the fiscal year in which we have more than $1 billion (as may be inflation-adjusted by the SEC from time-to-time) in annual revenues; the date we qualify as a "large accelerated filer," with more than $700 million in market value of our share capital held by non-affiliates; or the issuance by us of more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period. 
         We may choose to take advantage of some, but not all, of the available benefits under the JOBS Act. We cannot predict whether investors will find our ordinary shares less attractive if we rely on such exemptions. If some investors find our ordinary shares less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our ordinary shares and the market price of our ordinary shares may be more volatile. 
         In addition, the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption and, therefore, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. 
 106

             We have broad discretion in the use of our funds and may not use them effectively. 
         We have broad discretion in the application of our available funds and could spend the funds in ways that do not improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our ordinary shares. Our failure to apply these funds effectively could result in financial losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, cause the price of our ordinary shares to decline and delay the development of our product candidates. Pending their use, we may invest funds in a manner that does not produce income or that loses value. 
           We incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives and corporate governance practices. 
         As a public company we incur, and particularly after we are no longer an emerging growth company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of The Nasdaq Global Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, these rules and regulations have made it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and if such insurance becomes prohibitively expensive, this could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board. 
           If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, security holders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our ordinary shares. 
         Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, is designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us, as and when required, conducted in connection with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404, or any subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, as and when required, may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. As a growing company, implementing and maintaining effective controls may require more resources, and we may encounter internal control integration difficulties. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our ordinary shares. 
         Pursuant to Section 404, we will be required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting. However, as an emerging growth company, we will not be required to include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm until we are no longer an emerging growth company. To achieve compliance with Section 404 within the prescribed period, we are engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate 
 107

   through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. Despite our efforts, there is a risk that we will not be able to conclude within the prescribed timeframe that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section 404. This could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. 
           United States investors may have difficulty enforcing judgments against us, our directors and executive officers. 
         We are incorporated under the laws of Ireland, and our registered offices and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside of the United States. As a result, it may not be possible to effect service of process on such person or us in the United States or to enforce judgments obtained in courts in the United States against such person or us based on civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States. 
         There is no treaty between Ireland and the United States providing for the reciprocal enforcement of judgments obtained in the other jurisdiction and Irish common law rules govern the process by which a U.S. judgment may be enforced in Ireland. The following requirements must be met as a precondition before a U.S. judgment will be eligible for enforcement in Ireland:
 

 the judgment must be for a definite sum; 
 the judgment must be final and conclusive, and the decree must be final and enforceable in the court which pronounces it; 
 the judgment must be provided by a court of competent jurisdiction, and the procedural rules of the court giving the foreign judgment must have
been observed; 
 the U.S. court must have had jurisdiction in relation to the particular defendant according to Irish conflict of law rules; and 
 jurisdiction must be obtained by the Irish courts over judgment debtors in enforcement proceedings by service in Ireland or outside Ireland in
accordance with the applicable court rules in Ireland. 

         Even if the above requirements have been met, an Irish court may exercise its right to refuse to enforce the U.S. judgment if the Irish court is satisfied that the judgment (1) was obtained by fraud; (2) is in contravention of Irish public policy; (3) is in breach of natural justice; or (4) is irreconcilable with an earlier judgment. By way of example, a judgment of a U.S. court of liabilities predicated upon U.S. federal securities laws may not be enforced by Irish courts on the grounds of public policy if that U.S. judgment includes an award of punitive damages. Further, an Irish court may stay proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere. 
           We do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. 
         We have not paid any dividends on our ordinary shares since our incorporation. Even if future operations lead to significant levels of distributable profits, we currently intend that earnings, if any, will be reinvested in our business and that dividends will not be paid until we have an established revenue stream to support continuing dividends. If we propose to pay dividends in the future, we must do so in accordance with Irish law, which provides that distributions including dividend payments, share repurchases and redemptions be funded from "distributable reserves." In addition, the terms of the Loan Agreement with Hercules currently, and the terms of any future debt agreements may in the future, preclude us from paying dividends. Payment of future dividends to security holders will be at the discretion of our board, after taking into account various factors including our business prospects, cash requirements, financial performance, debt covenant limitations and new product development. As 
 108

   a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our ordinary shares will be the sole source of gain for holders of our ordinary shares for the foreseeable future. 
           We are exposed to risks related to currency exchange rates. 
         A portion of our expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates have had and could have a significant effect on our operating results. Exchange rate fluctuations between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar create risk in several ways, including the following:
 

 weakening of the U.S. dollar may increase the U.S. dollar cost of overseas research and development expenses; 
 strengthening of the U.S. dollar may decrease the value of our revenues denominated in other currencies; 
 the exchange rates on non-U.S. dollar transactions and cash deposits can distort our financial results; and 

           As a holding company, our operating results, financial condition and ability to pay dividends or other distributions are entirely dependent on funding, dividends and other distributions received from our subsidiaries, which may be subject to restrictions. 
         Our ability to pay dividends or other distributions and to pay our obligations in the future will depend on the level of funding, dividends and other distributions, if any, received from our subsidiaries and any new subsidiaries we establish in the future. The ability of our subsidiaries to make loans or distributions (directly or indirectly) to us may be restricted as a result of several factors, including restrictions in financing agreements and the requirements of applicable law and regulatory and fiscal or other restrictions. In particular, our subsidiaries and any new subsidiaries may be subject to laws that restrict dividend payments, authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to us, or limit or prohibit transactions with affiliates. Restrictions and regulatory action of this kind could impede access to funds that we may need to make dividend payments or to fund our own obligations. 
         Furthermore, we may guarantee some of the payment obligations of certain of our subsidiaries from time to time. These guarantees may require us to provide substantial funds or assets to our subsidiaries or their creditors or counterparties at a time when we are in need of liquidity to fund our own obligations. 
           The ownership percentage of our shareholders may be diluted in the future which could dilute the voting power or reduce the value our outstanding ordinary shares. 
         As with any publicly traded company, the ownership percentage of our shareholders may be diluted in the future because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including equity awards that we intend to continue to grant to our directors, officers and employees. From time to time, we may issue additional options or other share awards to our directors, officers and employees under our benefits plans. Our employees are also entitled, subject to certain conditions, to purchase our ordinary shares at a discount pursuant to our Employee Share Purchase Plan. 
         In addition, our articles of association authorize us to issue, without the approval of our shareholders, one or more classes or series of preferred shares having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over our ordinary shares respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred shares could dilute the voting power 
 109

   or reduce the value of our ordinary shares. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred shares could affect the residual value of the ordinary shares. Additionally, we may issue and sell our ordinary shares under our ATM Agreement from time to time, and we may issue additional ordinary shares as contingent consideration upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercialization milestones, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement. See "Risks Related to Ownership of our Ordinary SharesSubstantial future sales of our ordinary shares in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the price of our ordinary shares to decline significantly, even if our business is doing well.". 
           The rights of our shareholders may differ from the rights typically offered to shareholders of a U.S. corporation. We are incorporated as a public limited company under Irish law. 
         The rights of our shareholders are governed by our memorandum and articles of association and Irish law. The rights associated with our ordinary shares are different to the rights generally associated with shares held in a U.S. corporation. Material differences between the rights of shareholders of a U.S. corporation and the rights of our shareholders include differences with respect to, among other things, distributions, dividends, repurchases and redemptions, bonus issues, the election of directors, the removal of directors, the fiduciary and statutory duties of directors, conflicts of interests of directors, the indemnification of directors and officers, limitations on director liability, the convening of annual meetings of shareholders and special shareholder meetings, notice provisions for meetings, the quorum for shareholder meetings, the adjournment of shareholder meetings, the exercise of voting rights, shareholder suits, rights of dissenting shareholders, anti-takeover measures and provisions relating to the ability to amend the articles of association. 
           As an Irish public limited company, certain capital structure decisions require shareholder approval, which may limit our flexibility to manage our capital structure. 
         Under Irish law, our board of directors may increase our authorized share capital and issue new ordinary or preferred shares up to a maximum amount equal to the authorized but unissued share capital, without shareholder approval, once authorized to do so by our articles of association or by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders. Additionally, subject to specified exceptions, Irish law grants statutory preemption rights to existing shareholders where shares are being issued for cash consideration but allows shareholders to disapply such statutory preemption rights either in our articles of association or by way of special resolution. Such disapplication can either be generally applicable or be in respect of a particular allotment of shares. Accordingly, our articles of association contain, as permitted by Irish company law, provisions authorizing our board of directors to issue new shares, and to disapply statutory preemption rights. The authorization of our board of directors to issue shares and the disapplication of statutory preemption rights must both be renewed by the shareholders at least every five years, and we cannot provide any assurance that these authorizations will always be approved, which could limit our ability to issue equity and thereby adversely affect the holders of our ordinary shares. 
           Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the U.S. with respect to defending unwanted takeover proposals and may give our board less ability to control negotiations with hostile offerors. 
         We are subject to the Irish Takeover Panel Act, 1997, Takeover Rules, 2013. Under those Irish Takeover Rules, the board is not permitted to take any action that might frustrate an offer for our ordinary shares once the board has received an approach that may lead to an offer or has reason to believe that such an offer is or may be imminent, subject to certain exceptions. Potentially frustrating actions such as (i) the issue of ordinary shares, options or convertible securities, (ii) material acquisitions or disposals, (iii) entering into contracts other than in the ordinary course of business or 
 110

   (iv) any action, other than seeking alternative offers, which may result in frustration of an offer, are prohibited during the course of an offer or at any earlier time during which the board has reason to believe an offer is or may be imminent. These provisions may give the board less ability to control negotiations with hostile offerors and protect the interests of holders of ordinary shares than would be the case for a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States. 
           The operation of the Irish Takeover Rules may affect the ability of certain parties to acquire our ordinary shares. 
         Under the Irish Takeover Rules, if an acquisition of ordinary shares were to increase the aggregate holding of the acquirer and its concert parties to ordinary shares that represent 30% or more of the voting rights of a company, the acquirer and, in certain circumstances, its concert parties would be required (except with the consent of the Irish Takeover Panel) to make an offer for the outstanding ordinary shares at a price not less than the highest price paid for the ordinary shares by the acquirer or its concert parties during the previous 12 months. This requirement would also be triggered by an acquisition of ordinary shares by a person holding (together with its concert parties) ordinary shares that represent between 30% and 50% of the voting rights in the company if the effect of such acquisition were to increase that person's percentage of the voting rights by 0.05% within a 12-month period. The Irish Takeover Rules could therefore discourage an investor from acquiring 30% or more of our outstanding ordinary shares, unless such investor was prepared to make a bid to acquire all outstanding ordinary shares. 
         Certain separate concert parties will also be presumed to be acting in concert. Our board of directors and their relevant family members, related trusts and "controlled companies" are presumed to be acting in concert with any corporate shareholder who holds 20% or more of the company. The application of these presumptions may result in restrictions upon the ability of any of the concert parties and members of our board of directors to acquire more of our securities, including under the terms of any executive incentive arrangements. We may consult with the Irish Takeover Panel with respect to the application of this presumption and the restrictions on the ability to acquire further securities if necessary, although we are unable to provide any assurance as to whether the Irish Takeover Panel would overrule this presumption. 
           We will be exposed to the risk of future changes in law, which could materially adversely affect us. 
         We are subject to Irish law. As a result, we are subject to the risk of future adverse changes in Irish law (including Irish corporate and tax law). In addition, we and our subsidiaries are also subject to the risk of future adverse changes in Austrian and U.S. law, as well as changes of law in other countries in which we and our subsidiaries operate. 
           Future adverse changes in law could result in our not being able to maintain a worldwide effective corporate tax rate that is competitive in our industry. 
         While we believe that being incorporated in Ireland should not affect our ability to maintain a worldwide effective corporate tax rate that is competitive in our industry, we cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be because of, among other things, uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we will operate. The tax laws of Ireland, Austria, the United States, and other jurisdictions could change in the future, and such changes could cause a material change in our worldwide effective corporate tax rate. In particular, legislative action could be taken by Ireland, Austria, the United States or other jurisdictions which could override tax treaties upon which we expect to rely and adversely affect our effective tax rate. As a result, our actual effective tax rate may be materially different from our expectation.

             Comprehensive tax reform legislation could adversely affect our business and financial condition. 
         The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, introduced significant changes to the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or Code. 
         The Tax Act, among other things, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense, limitation of the deduction for net operating losses, one time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits. 
         We continue to examine the impact the Tax Act may have on our business. Notwithstanding the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the Tax Act is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
           After tax reform, U.S. persons who own 10 percent or more of our shares may be subject to U.S. federal income taxation on certain of our foreign subsidiaries' income even if such income is not distributed to such U.S. persons. 
         A foreign corporation is treated as a "controlled foreign corporation", or CFC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes if, on any day during a taxable year, "United States shareholders" (as defined below) own (directly, indirectly or constructively within the meaning of Section 958 of the Code) more than 50% of the total combined voting power of all classes of our voting shares or more than 50% of the total value of all of our shares. A "United States shareholder" of a foreign corporation is a U.S. person who owns (directly, indirectly or constructively within the meaning of Section 958 of the Code) at least 10% of the total combined voting power of voting shares of such non-U.S. corporation or at least 10% of the total value of shares of all classes of stock of such non-U.S. corporation. 
         As a result of the Tax Act, all of our non-U.S. subsidiaries will be treated as CFCs. The legislative history under the Tax Act indicates that this change was not intended to cause these non-U.S. subsidiaries to be treated as CFCs with respect to a United States shareholder that is not related to the U.S. subsidiary of the Company. However, it is not clear whether the IRS or a court would interpret the change made by the Tax Act in a manner consistent with such indicated intent. 
         Any United States shareholder who owns our shares (directly or indirectly within the meaning of Section 958(a) of the Code) on the last day in such taxable year must include in its gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes its pro rata share (based on direct or indirect ownership of value) of the non-U.S. subsidiaries' "subpart F income," regardless of whether that income was actually distributed to such U.S. person (with certain adjustments). "Subpart F income" of a CFC generally includes among other items passive income, such as dividends, interest, annuities, net gains from sales of property that do not generate active income, net commodities gains, net foreign currency gains, passive rents and royalties. 
         The Tax Act also requires such United States shareholders to include in their gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes their pro rata share of a CFC's "global intangible low tax income", or GILTI." In general terms, GILTI is the net income of the CFCs (other than income already included in United States shareholders' taxable income) that exceeds 10% of the CFCs' bases in depreciable tangible assets. GILTI is treated in a manner similar to subpart F income. 
         In addition, if a U.S. person disposes of shares in a non-U.S. corporation and the U.S. person was a United States shareholder at any time when the corporation was a CFC during the five-year period ending on the date of disposition, any gain from the disposition will generally be treated as a dividend to the extent of the U.S. person's share of the corporation's undistributed earnings and profits that were accumulated during the period or periods that the U.S. person owned the shares while the

   corporation was a CFC (with certain adjustments). Also, a U.S. person may be required to comply with specified reporting requirements, regardless of the number of shares owned. 
           A transfer of our ordinary shares, other than a transfer effected by means of the transfer of book-entry interests in the Depository Trust Company, may be subject to Irish stamp duty. 
         Transfers of our ordinary shares effected by means of the transfer of book entry interests in the Depository Trust Company, or DTC, will not be subject to Irish stamp duty. However, if you hold our ordinary shares directly rather than beneficially through DTC, any transfer of your ordinary shares could be subject to Irish stamp duty (currently at the rate of 1% of the higher of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired). Payment of Irish stamp duty is generally a legal obligation of the transferee. The potential for stamp duty could adversely affect the price of our ordinary shares. 
           Our ordinary shares received by means of a gift or inheritance could be subject to Irish capital acquisitions tax. 
         Irish capital acquisitions tax, or CAT, could apply to a gift or inheritance of our ordinary shares irrespective of the place of residence, ordinary residence or domicile of the parties. This is because our ordinary shares will be regarded as property situated in Ireland. The person who receives the gift or inheritance has primary liability for CAT. Gifts and inheritances passing between spouses are exempt from CAT. Children have a tax-free threshold of €320,000 in respect of taxable gifts or inheritances received from their parents. 
           We may be classified as a passive foreign investment company for our tax year ending December 31, 2018, which may result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequence to U.S. holders. 
         Based on our estimated gross income and average value of our gross assets and the nature of our business, we do not believe that we were a "passive foreign investment company," or PFIC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any tax years from our initial public offering through the year ended December 31, 2018. A corporation organized outside the United States generally will be classified as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes (1) in any taxable year in which at least 75% of its gross income is passive income or on average at least 50% of the gross value of its assets is attributable to assets that produce passive income or are held for the production of passive income and (2) as to a given holder who was a holder in such year and regardless of such corporation's income or asset composition, in any subsequent taxable year, unless certain elections are made by that holder that can discontinue that classification as to that holder, at the risk of imposing substantial tax costs to that holder. Passive income for this purpose generally includes dividends, interest, royalties, rents and gains from commodities and securities transactions. Our status in any taxable year will depend on our assets and activities in each year, and because this is a factual determination made annually after the end of each taxable year, there can be no assurance that we will not be considered a PFIC for the current taxable year or any future taxable year. The gross value of our assets may be determined in part by reference to the market price of our ordinary shares, which may fluctuate considerably given that market prices of biotechnology companies have been especially volatile. If we were to be treated as a PFIC for the tax year ending December 31, 2018, or any future taxable year during which a U.S. holder held our ordinary shares, however, certain adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences could apply to the U.S. holder. We currently intend to make available the information necessary to permit a U.S. holder to make a valid QEF election, which may mitigate some of the adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences that could apply to a U.S. holder of ordinary shares if we determine that we were a PFIC for any taxable year. However, we may choose not to provide such information at a future date.
