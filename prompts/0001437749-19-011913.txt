The Company competes with a variety of distributors and manufacturers (both branded and private label), including large infant and juvenile product companies and specialty infant and juvenile product manufacturers, on the basis of quality, design, price, brand name recognition, service and packaging.

Trademarks, Copyrights and Patents

Product Sourcing
 
Foreign and domestic contract manufacturers produce most of the Company’s products, with the largest concentration being in China. The Company makes sourcing decisions on the basis of quality, timeliness of delivery and price, including the impact of ocean freight and duties. Although the Company maintains relationships with a limited number of suppliers, the Company believes that its products may be readily manufactured by several alternative sources in quantities sufficient to meet the Company's requirements. The Company’s management and quality assurance personnel visit the third-party facilities regularly to monitor and audit product quality and to ensure compliance with labor requirements and social and environmental standards. In addition, the Company closely monitors the currency exchange rate. The impact of future fluctuations in the exchange rate or changes in safeguards cannot be predicted with certainty. The Company also produces some of its products domestically at a Company facility located in Douglasville, Georgia.
 
The Company maintains a foreign representative office located in Shanghai, China, which is responsible for the coordination of production, purchases and shipments, seeking out new vendors and overseeing inspections for social compliance and quality.
 
The Company’s products are warehoused and distributed from leased facilities located in Compton, California and Douglasville, Georgia.
 
Product Design and Styling
 
The Company believes that its creative team is one of its key strengths. The Company’s product designs are primarily created internally and are supplemented by numerous additional sources, including independent artists, decorative fabric manufacturers and apparel designers. Ideas for product design creations are drawn from various sources and are reviewed and modified by the design staff to ensure consistency within the Company’s existing product offerings and the themes and images associated with such existing products. In order to respond effectively to changing consumer preferences, the Company’s designers and stylists attempt to stay abreast of emerging lifestyle trends in color, fashion and design. When designing products under the Company’s various licensed brands, the Company’s designers coordinate their efforts with the licensors’ design teams to provide for a more fluid design approval process and to effectively incorporate the image of the licensed brand into the product. The Company’s designs include traditional, contemporary, textured and whimsical patterns across a broad spectrum of retail price points. Utilizing state of the art computer technology, the Company continually develops new designs throughout the year for all of its product groups. This continual development cycle affords the Company design flexibility, multiple opportunities to present new products to customers and the ability to provide timely responses to customer demands and changing market trends. The Company also creates designs for exclusive sale by certain of its customers under the Company’s brands, as well as the customers’ private label brands.
Seasonality and Inventory Management
 
There are no significant variations in the seasonal demand for the Company’s products from year to year. Sales are generally higher in periods when customers take initial shipments of new products, as these orders typically include enough products for initial sets for each store and additional quantities for the customer’s distribution centers. The timing of these initial shipments varies by customer and depends on when the customer finalizes store layouts for the upcoming year and whether the customer has any mid-year introductions of products. Sales may also be higher or lower, as the case may be, in periods when customers are restricting internal inventory levels. Consistent with the expected introduction of specific product offerings, the Company carries necessary levels of inventory to meet the anticipated delivery requirements of its customers. Customer returns of merchandise shipped are historically less than 1% of gross sales.
Customers
 
The Company's customers consist principally of mass merchants, mid-tier retailers, juvenile specialty stores, value channel stores, grocery and drug stores, restaurants, internet accounts and wholesale clubs. The Company does not enter into long-term or other purchase agreements with its customers. The table below sets forth those customers that represented at least 10% of the Company’s gross sales in fiscal years 2019 and 2018.
