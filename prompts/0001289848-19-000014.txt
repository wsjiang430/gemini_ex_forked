EMPLOYEES
Our success depends on our ability to attract, engage, develop and retain highly talented professionals. We know that by creating a work environment where employees can shape their futures, and individuals are rewarded not only for their own contributions, but also for the success of our organization, we can accomplish these goals. We are focused on advancing every facet of the employee experience, beginning with the recruiting process through post-employment or retirement. We want to create a personalized experience for our people, where they are empowered, and can make an impact. We have developed comprehensive programs incorporating learning opportunities, beginning with the onboarding process and continuing throughout one’s career. We provide a competitive total rewards package including benefits that are tailored to the unique needs of our employees. Our commitment to corporate social responsibility is facilitated through our Huron Helping Hands program and the Diversity and Inclusion council. 
Our employee population is divided into two groups: client-serving and support professionals. As of December 31, 2018, we had 3,269 full-time employees, including 147 client-serving managing directors. Our client-serving employees serve as critical business advisors; collaborating with clients to help solve their most complex business problems. Our managing directors are the key drivers of growth in our business, generating new revenue streams from existing and new clients. They enhance our market reputation by partnering with clients as advisors and engagement team leaders. Internally, they create our intellectual capital, develop our people, and are stewards of our culture. Our senior directors, directors, and managers manage day-to-day client relationships, develop our people, nurture our culture, and oversee the delivery and quality of our work product. Our associates and analysts gather and organize data, conduct detailed analyses, and prepare presentations that synthesize and distill information to support recommendations we deliver to clients. Our support professionals include our senior management team as well as those who provide sales support, methodology creation, software development, and corporate functions consisting of our facilities, finance and accounting, human resources, information technology, legal, and marketing teams. These employees provide strategic direction and support that enables the success of our client-serving employees. At December 31, 2018, our support professionals team was led by 22 managing directors, executives and corporate vice presidents.
In addition to our full-time client-serving employees, we engage temporary employees on an as-needed basis to provide unique skill sets that are not required to be staffed on a full-time basis. 
Supporting our professionals' career advancement is critical to our employee retention and engagement. As part of our onboarding process, our employee experience team facilitates a robust and structured learning curriculum for newly hired employees to develop and onboard 
2

them more effectively into the company. Leadership development programs are offered to recently promoted employees to support their transition to and success in a new role with broader responsibility. In addition to these milestone programs, we offer a variety of leadership development opportunities for those who exhibit the capability and the desire to take on broader roles in the organization. We also provide a variety of continuing education opportunities to our employees, through online and classroom environments, to further develop employees’ capabilities, including technical knowledge, people skills, team dynamics and coaching and developing others. We encourage our employees to enhance their professional skills through external learning opportunities that certify their technical skills and to pursue certain advanced degrees. Employees are matched with internal performance coaches and mentors to help them grow in their careers, including identifying opportunities for professional development, formal training, and technical skill certifications.
Our total rewards philosophy focuses on rewarding and retaining our high performing employees. To accomplish this, we offer employees a competitive base salary, performance incentives and benefits.
Our incentive compensation plan is designed to recognize and reward performance of both the organization and individuals and to ensure we retain our top performers. We take both practice and company financial performance into consideration in the determination of bonus pool funding. At the practice level, the annual bonus pool is funded based on achievement of its annual financial goals. The board of directors reviews and approves the total incentive compensation pool for all practices in the context of the company’s overall financial performance. Individual bonus awards are based on the practice’s financial performance, individual bonus targets, and the individual’s performance as evaluated through our performance management process. The intent of the incentive compensation plan is to differentiate rewards based on individual performance, ensuring that our top performers for the year receive incentives that are commensurate with their contributions, which enables Huron to retain them and continue to provide our clients with exceptional service. The incentive compensation plan for our named executive officers is funded based on a blend of achievement of financial goals and strategic initiatives.
Managing directors’ individual compensation levels, including base salary and target incentive awards, are set to align with the value of their expected contributions to the organization, including collaboration across practices. As the key drivers of the organization’s success, their compensation is designed to include equity awards as a core component. The use of equity is intended to encourage retention, align the interests of our managing directors with shareholders, and help build wealth over a managing director's career at Huron through annual grants as well as stock price appreciation.
Our benefit programs are designed to be both comprehensive, competitive and personalized to the needs of our employees, such as a paid time off program that allows for flexibility and a travel reward program which recognizes the significant travel commitment of our client-serving workforce. We provide opportunities that allow employees to focus and care for their personal well-being that are aimed at providing tools and resources to focus on their physical, financial, social, and emotional health given the demanding nature of their work. In addition, our health and welfare plans, retirement benefits, and stock purchase plan, provide a core sense of security to our employees and their families.
Our corporate social responsibility efforts are designed to support an individual’s charitable interests while also providing a venue for our employees to come together to make an impact in the communities in which we live and work. In addition, the Diversity and Inclusion council supports the needs of our growing employee population through employee resource groups that provide corporate-wide educational opportunities, build awareness, celebrate our differences, develop mentoring relationships, and ensure we are fostering a welcoming and engaging environment for all employees. 
BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING
Our business development and marketing activities are aimed at cultivating relationships, generating leads, and building a strong brand reputation with hospital, health system, and university administrators; offices of the C-suite; and senior level influencers and decision makers of middle market and large corporate organizations. We believe excellent service delivery to clients is critical to building and maintaining relationships and our brand reputation, and we emphasize the importance of client service to all of our employees.
Currently, we generate new business opportunities through the combination of relationships our managing directors have with individuals working in healthcare organizations, academic and research institutions, and corporations, and marketing lead generation activities. We also view market-based collaboration between our managing directors as a key component in building our business. Often, the client relationship of a managing director in one area of our business leads to opportunities in another area. All of our managing directors understand their roles in ongoing relationship and business development, which is reinforced through our compensation and incentive programs. We actively seek to identify new business opportunities and frequently receive referrals and repeat business from past and current clients. In addition, to complement the business development efforts of our managing directors, we have dedicated business development professionals who are focused exclusively on developing client relationships and generating new business.
COMPETITION
The professional services industry is extremely competitive, highly fragmented, and constantly evolving. The industry includes a large number of participants with a variety of skills and industry expertise, including other strategy, business operations, technology, and financial consulting firms; general management consulting firms; the consulting practices of major accounting firms; technical and economic advisory

firms; regional and specialty consulting firms; and the internal professional resources of organizations. We compete with a large number of service and technology providers in all of our segments. Our competitors vary, depending on the particular practice area, and we expect to continue to face competition from new market entrants. 
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include reputation, the ability to attract and retain top talent, the capacity to manage engagements effectively to drive high value to clients, and the ability to deliver measurable and sustainable results. There is also competition on price, although to a lesser extent due to the criticality of the issues that many of our services address. Some competitors have a greater geographic footprint, broader international presence, and more resources than we do, but we believe our reputation and ability to deliver high-value, quality service and measurable results to our clients across a balanced portfolio of services and attract and retain employees with broad capabilities and deep industry expertise enable us to compete favorably in the professional services marketplace.
