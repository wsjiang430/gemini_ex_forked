Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a New York corporation formed in 1983. As of the fiscal year ended September 28, 2019, we owned and/or operated 20 restaurants and bars, 17 fast food concepts and catering operations through our subsidiaries. Initially our facilities were located only in New York City. As of the fiscal year ended September 28, 2019, five of our restaurant and bar facilities are located in New York City, two are located in Washington, D.C., five are located in Las Vegas, Nevada, three are located in Atlantic City, New Jersey, three are located on the east coast of Florida and two are located on the gulf coast of Alabama.
In addition to the shift from a Manhattan-based operation to a multi-city operation, the nature of the facilities operated by us has shifted from smaller, neighborhood restaurants to larger, destination properties intended to benefit from high patron traffic attributable to the uniqueness of the location and catered events. Most of our properties which have been opened in recent years are of the latter description. As of the fiscal year ended September 28, 2019, these include the operations at the 12 fast food facilities in Tampa, Florida and Hollywood, Florida (2004); the Gallagher’s Steakhouse and Gallagher’s Burger Bar in the Resorts Atlantic City Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey (2005); Yolos at the Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada (2007); Robert at the Museum of Arts & Design at Columbus Circle in Manhattan (2010); Broadway Burger Bar and Grill at the New York-New York Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada (2011); Clyde Frazier’s Wine and Dine in Manhattan (2012); Broadway Burger Bar and Grill in the Quarter at the Tropicana Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey (2013); The Rustic Inn in Dania Beach, Florida (2014); Shuckers in Jensen Beach, Florida (2016); two Original Oyster Houses, one in Gulf Shores, Alabama and one in Spanish Fort, Alabama (2017) and JB's on the Beach in Deerfield Beach, Florida (2019).
The names and themes of each of our restaurants are different except for our two Gallagher’s Steakhouse restaurants, two Broadway Burger Bar and Grill restaurants, and two Original Oyster House restaurants. The menus in our restaurants are extensive, offering a wide variety of high-quality foods at generally moderate prices. The atmosphere at many of the restaurants is lively and extremely casual. Most of the restaurants have separate bar areas, are open seven days a week and most serve lunch as well as dinner. A majority of our net sales are derived from dinner as opposed to lunch service.
While decor differs from restaurant to restaurant, interiors are marked by distinctive architectural and design elements which often incorporate dramatic interior open spaces and extensive glass exteriors. The wall treatments, lighting and decorations are typically vivid, unusual and, in some cases, highly theatrical.

Leases
We are not currently committed to any significant projects; however, we may take advantage of opportunities we consider to be favorable, when they occur, depending upon the availability of financing and other factors.
Restaurant Expansion and Other Developments
On May 15, 2019, the Company, through a newly formed, wholly-owned subsidiary, acquired the assets of JB's on the Beach, a restaurant and bar located in Deerfield Beach, Florida for $7,036,000. The acquisition is accounted for as a business combination and was financed with a bank loan from the Company’s existing lender in the amount of $7,000,000 and cash from operations. Concurrent with the acquisition, the Company entered into a 20 year lease (with a five year option) for the restaurant facility and parking lot with the former owner of JB's on the Beach, who is also the owner of the underlying real estate. Rent payments under the lease are $600,000 per year with 10% increases every five years.
The opening of a new restaurant is invariably accompanied by substantial pre-opening expenses and early operating losses associated with the training of personnel, excess kitchen costs, costs of supervision and other expenses during the pre-opening period and during a post-opening “shake out” period until operations can be considered to be functioning normally. The amount of such pre-opening expenses and early operating losses can generally be expected to depend upon the size and complexity of the facility being opened.
During 2019, the Company was advised by the landlord of our food court at the Hard Rock Casino and Hotel in Hollywood, Florida that they were exercising their right to relocate our space, at their sole cost, as contractually agreed to in the original lease. The new facilities were completed on September 16, 2019, on which date we closed our existing location and opened the new facilities. The Company recorded the value of the renovations made by the landlord, which includes leasehold improvements and furniture, fixtures and equipment, in the amount of $5,474,000 with a corresponding increase in deferred rent. The net book value of the existing leasehold improvements relating to the original location in the amount of $918,000 is being reflected as a reduction of deferred rent on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term. 
During 2019, the Company was advised by the landlord of our food court at the Hard Rock Casino and Hotel in Tampa, Florida that they were exercising their right to renovate the front of the house space, at their sole cost, as contractually agreed to in the original lease. In connection with this renovation, we closed our existing facilities on June 2, 2019 and re-opened the renovated facilities on September 28, 2019. The Company recorded the value of the renovations made by the landlord, which includes leasehold improvements and furniture, fixtures and equipment, in the amount of $3,179,000 with a corresponding increase in deferred rent. The net book value of the existing leasehold improvements relating to the original location in the amount of $459,000 is being reflected as a reduction of deferred rent on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term. 
Our restaurants generally do not achieve substantial increases in revenue from year to year, which we consider to be typical of the restaurant industry. To achieve significant increases in revenue or to replace revenue of restaurants that lose customer favor or which close because of lease expirations or other reasons, we would have to open additional restaurant facilities or expand existing restaurants. There can be no assurance that a restaurant will be successful after it is opened, particularly since in many instances we do not operate our new restaurants under a trade name currently used by us, thereby requiring new restaurants to establish their own identity.
Investment in New Meadowlands Racetrack LLC
On March 12, 2013, the Company made a $4,200,000 investment in the New Meadowlands Racetrack LLC (“NMR”) through its purchase of a membership interest in Meadowlands Newmark, LLC, an existing member of NMR. On November 19, 2013, the Company invested an additional $464,000 in NMR through a purchase of an additional membership interest in Meadowlands Newmark, LLC resulting in a total ownership of 11.6% of Meadowlands Newmark, LLC, and an effective ownership interest in NMR of 7.4%, subject to dilution. In 2015, the Company invested an additional $222,000 in NMR and in February 2017 the Company invested an additional $222,000 in NMR, both as a result of capital calls, bringing its total investment to $5,108,000 with no change in ownership.
In addition to the Company’s ownership interest in NMR, if casino gaming is approved at the Meadowlands and NMR is granted the right to conduct said gaming, the Company shall be granted the exclusive right to operate the food and beverage concessions in the gaming facility with the exception of one restaurant.
In conjunction with this investment, the Company, through a 97% owned subsidiary, Ark Meadowlands LLC (“AM VIE”), also entered into a long-term agreement with NMR for the exclusive right to operate food and beverage concessions serving the new raceway facilities (the “Racing F&B Concessions”) located in the new raceway grandstand constructed at the Meadowlands 
Racetrack in northern New Jersey. Under the agreement, NMR is responsible to pay for the costs and expenses incurred in the operation of the Racing F&B Concessions, and all revenues and profits thereof inure to the benefit of NMR. AM VIE receives an annual fee equal to 5% of the net profits received by NMR from the Racing F&B Concessions during each calendar year.
On April 25, 2014, the Company loaned $1,500,000 to Meadowlands Newmark, LLC. The note bears interest at 3%, compounded monthly and added to the principal, and is due in its entirety on January 31, 2024. The note may be prepaid, in whole or in part, at any time without penalty or premium. On July 13, 2016, the Company made an additional loan to Meadowlands Newmark, LLC in the amount of $200,000. Such amount is subject to the same terms and conditions as the original loan discussed above. The principal and accrued interest related to this note in the amounts of $1,713,000 and $1,928,000, are included in Investment In and Receivable From New Meadowlands Racetrack in the consolidated balance sheets at September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, respectively.
On June 7, 2018, the New Jersey State Legislature voted to legalize sports betting at casinos and racetracks in the state. Pursuant to this legislation, NMR opened a sports book in partnership with FanDuel, a leading provider of daily fantasy sports, in June 2018.
Recent Restaurant Dispositions
As of December 29, 2018, the Company determined that it would not be able to operate Durgin-Park profitably due to decreased traffic at the Faneuil Hall Marketplace in Boston, MA, where it was located, and rising labor costs. As a result, included in the statement of income for the 39 weeks ended June 29, 2019 are losses on closure in the amount of $1,106,000 consisting of: (i) impairment of trademarks in the amount of $721,000, (ii) accelerated depreciation of fixed assets in the amount of $333,000, and (iii) write-offs of prepaid and other expenses in the amount of $52,000. The restaurant closed on January 12, 2019.
Restaurant Management
Each restaurant is managed by its own manager and has its own chef. Food products and other supplies are purchased primarily from various unaffiliated suppliers, in most cases by our headquarters' personnel. Each of our restaurants has two or more assistant managers and sous chefs (assistant chefs). Financial and management control is maintained at the corporate level through the use of automated systems that include centralized accounting and reporting.
Purchasing and Distribution
We strive to obtain quality menu ingredients, raw materials and other supplies and services for our operations from reliable sources at competitive prices. Substantially all menu items are prepared on each restaurant’s premises daily from scratch, using fresh ingredients. Each restaurant’s management determines the quantities of food and supplies required and then orders the items from local, regional and national suppliers on terms negotiated by our centralized purchasing staff. Restaurant-level inventories are maintained at a minimum dollar-value level in relation to sales due to the relatively rapid turnover of the perishable produce, poultry, meat, fish and dairy commodities that are used in operations.
We attempt to negotiate short-term and long-term supply agreements depending on market conditions and expected demand. However, we do not contract for long periods of time for our fresh commodities such as produce, poultry, meat, fish and dairy items and, consequently, such commodities can be subject to unforeseen supply and cost fluctuations. Independent foodservice distributors deliver most food and supply items daily to restaurants. The financial impact of the termination of any such supply agreements would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position.
Competition
The hospitality industry is highly competitive and is often affected by changes in taste and entertainment trends among the public, by local, national and economic conditions affecting spending habits, and by population and traffic patterns. We believe that the principal means of competition among restaurants include the location, type and quality of facilities and the type, quality and price of beverage and food served.
Our restaurants compete directly or indirectly with many well-established competitors, both nationally and locally owned, some with substantially greater financial resources than we have. Their resources and market presence may provide advantages in marketing, purchasing and negotiating leases. We compete with other restaurant and retail establishments for sites and finding management personnel.
Employees
At November 30, 2019, we employed 2,145 persons (including employees at managed facilities), 1,328 of whom were full-time employees, and 817 of whom were part-time employees; 48 of whom were headquarters personnel, 141 of whom were restaurant management personnel, 1,298 of whom were kitchen personnel and 658 of whom were restaurant service personnel. A number of our restaurant service personnel are employed on a part-time basis. Changes in minimum wage levels may adversely affect our labor costs and the restaurant industry generally because a large percentage of restaurant personnel are paid at or slightly above the minimum wage. Our employees are not covered by any collective bargaining agreements.
Government Regulation
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting our business. Each restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities that may include alcoholic beverage control, health, sanitation, environmental, zoning and public safety agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located. Difficulties in obtaining or failures to obtain the required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the development and openings of new restaurants, or could disrupt the operations of existing restaurants.
Alcoholic beverage control regulations require each of our restaurants to apply to a state authority and, in certain locations, county and municipal authorities for licenses and permits to sell alcoholic beverages on the premises. Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be subject to penalties, temporary suspension or revocation for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations impact many aspects of the daily operations of our restaurants, including the minimum ages of patrons and employees consuming or serving such beverages; employee alcoholic beverages training and certification requirements; hours of operation; advertising; wholesale purchasing and inventory control of such beverages; seating of minors and the service of food within our bar areas; and the storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. State and local authorities in many jurisdictions routinely monitor compliance with alcoholic beverage laws. The failure to receive or retain, or a delay in obtaining, a liquor license for a particular restaurant could adversely affect our ability to obtain such licenses in jurisdictions where the failure to receive or retain, or a delay in obtaining, a liquor license occurred.
We are subject to “dram-shop” statutes in most of the states in which we have operations, which generally provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to such person. We carry liquor liability coverage as part of our existing comprehensive general liability insurance. A settlement or judgment against us under a “dram-shop” statute in excess of liability coverage could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
Various federal and state labor laws govern our operations and our relationship with employees, including such matters as minimum wages, breaks, overtime, fringe benefits, safety, working conditions and citizenship requirements. We are also subject to the regulations of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. If our employees do not meet federal citizenship or residency requirements, their deportation could lead to a disruption in our work force. Significant government-imposed increases in minimum wages, paid leaves of absence and mandated health benefits, or increased tax reporting, assessment or payment requirements related to employees who receive gratuities could be detrimental to our profitability.
Our facilities must comply with the applicable requirements of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”) and related state statutes. The ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability with respect to public accommodations and employment. Under the ADA and related state laws, when constructing new restaurants or undertaking significant remodeling of existing restaurants, we must make them more readily accessible to disabled persons.
The New York State Liquor Authority must approve any transaction in which a shareholder of the licensee increases his holdings to 10% or more of the outstanding capital stock of the licensee and any transaction involving 10% or more of the outstanding capital stock of the licensee.
Seasonal Nature of Business
Our business is highly seasonal; however, our broader geographical reach as a result of recent acquisitions mitigates some of the risk. For instance, the second quarter of our fiscal year, consisting of the non-holiday portion of the cold weather season in New York and Washington (January, February and March), is the poorest performing quarter; however, in recent years this has been partially offset by our locations in Florida as they experience increased results in the winter months. We achieve our best results during the warm weather, attributable to our extensive outdoor dining availability, particularly at Bryant Park in New York and Sequoia in Washington, D.C. (our largest restaurants) and our outdoor cafes. However, even during summer months these facilities can be adversely affected by unusually cool or rainy weather conditions. Our facilities in Las Vegas are indoor and generally operate on a more consistent basis throughout the year.
