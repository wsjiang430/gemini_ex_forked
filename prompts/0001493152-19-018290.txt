Item 1. Business
Overview
 
Building on a history of over 1,500 new homes built, the management of Dream Homes & Development Corporation has positioned the company to emerge as a rapidly growing regional developer of new single-family subdivisions as well as a leader in coastal construction, elevation and mitigation. In the six years that have passed since Superstorm Sandy flooded 40,000 owner-occupied homes, Dream Homes has helped hundreds of homeowners to rebuild or raise their homes to comply with new FEMA requirements. While other builders have struggled to adapt to the changing market and complex Federal, State and local regulations involved with coastal construction in Flood Hazard Areas, Dream Homes has excelled. As many of our competitors have failed, Dream Homes has developed a reputation as the region’s most trusted builder and has even become known as the “rescue” builder for homeowners whose projects have been abandoned by others. Due to the damage caused by the storm, as well as the material changes in the FEMA flood maps which now require over 30,000 homeowners along the New Jersey coastline to elevate their homes, Dream Homes is positioned to capitalize on this opportunity for substantial revenue growth.
 
Management anticipates steady growth in this division of the company, since the rebuilding process will occur over the next 15-20 years, and have an anticipated market value of $3,400,000,000. The company anticipates being able to efficiently address 5% - 10% of this market. Dream Homes’ potential operations include the development and sale of a variety of residential communities, including construction of semi-custom homes, entry-level and first time move-up single-family and multi-family homes.
 
In addition to the New Jersey market, the Company, through its Dream Building LLC subsidiary, has become licensed in Florida to pursue recent opportunities for elevation, restoration, renovation and new construction brought about by the damage caused by recent hurricanes. Initial markets to be targeted are located primarily in the southwest portion of the state, between Naples and Cape Coral.
 
In addition to the projects which the Company currently has under contract for elevation, renovation, new construction and development, there are a number of parcels of land which the Company has the ability to secure, whether through land contract or other types of options. These parcels represent additional opportunities for development and construction potential on the order of an additional 400 - 800 lots and/or residential units to be developed and built within an approximate time horizon of 5 years. Conceivably, this volume of production could yield $120,000,000 - $240,000,000 in gross revenue and $25,000,000 - $50,000,000 in earnings to the Company.
 
Management recognized that the effects of Super Storm Sandy, which occurred on 10/29/12 would be far reaching and cause an almost unlimited demand for construction services, as well as specific construction information. Due to the damage caused by the storm, as well as the material changes in the FEMA flood maps which now require over 30,000 homeowners along the New Jersey coastline to elevate their homes, management feels that focusing on the construction field will continue to provide a stable revenue stream for the company.
 
Due to the opportunities afforded by the market conditions, Dream Homes and Development Corporation as well as its wholly owned subsidiaries, will continue to pursue opportunities in the construction and real estate field, specifically in new home construction, home elevations and renovations.
 
In addition to the existing elevation, renovation and new home projects currently in process, Dream has also estimated an additional $5,300,000 worth of residential construction projects and currently has over 200 active prospects to its data base. All of these prospects are prime candidates for educational videos and short books on specific construction and rebuilding topics, as well as candidates for rebuilding projects to be built under the Dream Building LLC division.

At this time, we are not aware of any other building and development companies which offer these services to the public.
 
The Nearly Famous Rebuilding Seminar is held bi-monthly, and is a powerful educational tool for homeowners who need of rebuilding or renovations. This seminar has been presented steadily since early 2013, and is designed to educate and assist homeowners in deciphering the confusion about planning and executing complex residential construction projects. A professional team attends each seminar and presents on a diverse variety of topics, including expert advice from some or all of the following attendant at each seminar: architects, engineers, finance people, attorneys, project managers, elevation professionals and builder/general contractors.

Our Growth Strategy
 
The Company has recognized that the effects of Super Storm Sandy, which occurred on 10/29/12 would be far reaching and cause an almost unlimited demand for construction information, as well as specific construction services. Due to the damage caused by the storm, as well as the material changes in the FEMA flood maps which now require over 30,000 homeowners along the New Jersey coastline to elevate their homes, the management team of Dream feels that pursuing new home construction and elevation/renovation projects will continue to produce a stable revenue stream for the company.
 
In addition to the Company’s current projects, Dream Building LLC has also estimated an additional $5,300,000 worth of residential construction projects and added over 200 active prospects to its data base. All of these prospects are prime candidates for educational videos and short books on specific construction and rebuilding topics, as well as candidates for rebuilding projects to be built under the Dream Building LLC division.
 
Management anticipates steady growth in this division of the company, since the rebuilding process will occur over the next 15-20 years, and have a market value of $3,400,000,000. The company anticipates being able to efficiently address 5% - 10% of this market.

Finance and credit facilities
 
Dream Homes has secured a line of credit from a private lender for general working capital. This credit line is structured on an on-demand basis, bears an interest rate of 12% APR charged only for funds in use, and is in the amount of $50,000. Though there are no specific uses for this facility at this time, management anticipates that it will be utilized to further expand various aspects of the company. The lender has indicated willingness to fund future real-estate based investments (such as acquisition of buildable lots, construction of new single family homes and single family home purchases for renovation), on an ongoing basis.

Our Markets
 
The Company seeks to become a fully integrated real estate company specializing in the elevation and moving of homes, development and sale of approved and improved land, and construction of townhouses, single-family homes and various residential properties located throughout southern New Jersey. Our principal real estate operations are currently conducted in the central & southern part of the State of New Jersey, although it is our intention to expand into additional markets based on market demand. It is our observation that the fundamental value of the land in southern New Jersey, particularly areas affected by Storm Sandy and represented by Ocean, Monmouth, Atlantic, Cape May, is currently at pricing levels which have not been seen in New Jersey for 10 – 15 years.
 
Because of the reduction in land values in New Jersey to levels that we feel represent attractive investment opportunities, we have the opportunity to offer homes at more competitive and affordable pricing levels. Our ability to offer elevation management, complete renovation, demolition and new construction and full architectural and engineering services gives us the ability to offer all clients a full range of services.
 
Our initial investment goal is to evaluate each property to determine the best path to take in order to maximize potential return for that particular property. With new construction, our intention is to purchase either fully improved or at least fully approved properties. Fully approved properties includes those having all the entitlements and permits in hand, and as needed, to post performance guarantees and/or file subdivision maps, and/or proceed with infrastructure construction, such as utilities, roads and other site improvements. With new construction, we have adopted this business model to help reduce our exposure to the many risks and costs associated with land development.
 
From time to time, and as we come across an outstanding investment opportunity in land development priced at a level that justifies the inherent risks and costs associated with land development, the Company may contract for, and will bring through the approval process, various types of raw land. The Company will continue to allocate capital in the pursuit of approvals, since the risk/reward of developmental activity is so great. It should be noted that we do not generally take ownership of the property until the approval process has been completed, but rather control the property through contracts and options. In these instances, if we should fail to obtain approvals for any reason, whether through unsuitability, change of zoning or other factors, our loss shall be limited to the money expended for the approvals to that date. Our planned business model includes the acquisition, construction, and sale of a variety of residential properties, including construction of entry-level and first time move-up single-family and multi-family homes.

In addition to offering traditional stick frame construction of our homes, we may also offer modular and manufactured homes, townhomes and condominiums.
 
In our opinion, the most effective business model for residential development and construction is to target the largest current and future segment of the home buying market, which appears to be primarily first-time and move-up purchasers, as well as those homeowners forced to move or relocate due to Storm Sandy, another storm related event, or obsolescence of their existing property. According to Zillow (http//www.zillow.com/local-info/NJ-hjome-value/r40/), the optimum size and price range for a starter or first time- move up single family home is 1600 – 2000 square feet and $180,000 - $230,000. Townhomes and condominium preferred size and price range is 1400 – 1800 square feet and $170,000 - $220,000.
 
In our opinion, the southern New Jersey real estate market represents one of the most attractive real estate investment opportunities, with the greatest opportunity for future appreciation being concentrated in Ocean, Atlantic, Cape May, Monmouth and Middlesex counties. These areas primarily fall within 1-hour driving time, and serve as “bedroom” communities for, the Atlantic City, New York and Philadelphia metropolitan areas. In our opinion, the residential housing demand in this area, particularly in the market segments which we intend to address, enjoys a fundamental support level, based on several factors. These factors include excellent air, rail and road infrastructure, Atlantic City casino and support services, tourism, and a central location between Philadelphia and New York. Additionally, there has been a chronic affordable housing shortage throughout New Jersey and all indication are that condition will continue fot the foreseeable future. This situation plays well into the Company’s strengths, which are focused on entry level or first time move up housing, as well as elevations and renovations of existing damaged homes. Finally, all of these market areas have tremendous growth potential due to the effects of Storm Sandy on the available housing supply.
 
In addition, historically and according to the NJ Housing Affordability Index (http://www.yourhousefast.com/housing-affor-index.asp) which is currently 126, home ownership is more affordable than renting. In this case, the index being above 100 signifies that a family earning the median income has 26% more income than is necessary to qualify for a mortgage loan on a median-priced home, and therefore housing prices in these areas offer much better value than comparable properties in the North Jersey, New York and Philadelphia areas.
 
Nationwide, affordability is at an all-time high. According to the National Association of Home Builders, the Housing Opportunity Index (HOI) is at a record level, with 75.9% of all new and existing homes sold in the fourth quarter of 2011 considered to be affordable to families earning the national median income of $64,200. See http://www.nahb.org/news_details.aspx?sectionID-135&newsID-15036 for more detail.
 
Zillow and the NJ Housing Affordability Index are publicly available at the web citations noted above, are constantly updated, and the Company’s management believes them to be accurate and reliable.
 
Employees
 
The company relies on certain administrative & payroll support for employees from Dream Homes Ltd., which currently owns 17.91% of the Company. DHL provides payroll services that includes the 2 officers of the Company, as well as certain employees and allocates payroll proportionately as required.
 
There are currently 13 full time employees, including 2 officers, in addition to a number of part time employees on an as-needed basis, who are being compensated under this arrangement. These include, but are not limited to, the following people listed below. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has not entered into any employment or consulting agreements.
