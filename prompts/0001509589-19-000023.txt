Item 1. Business
When we use the terms “Bonanza Creek,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” we are referring to Bonanza Creek Energy, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context otherwise requires. We have included certain technical terms important to an understanding of our business under Glossary of Oil and Natural Gas Terms above. Throughout this document we make statements that may be classified as “forward-looking” Please refer to the Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements section above for an explanation of these types of statements.
Overview
Bonanza Creek is a Denver-based exploration and production company focused on the extraction of oil and associated liquids-rich natural gas in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States. Bonanza Creek Energy, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware on December 2, 2010 and went public in December 2011.
The Company's assets and operations are concentrated in the rural portions of unincorporated Weld County within the Wattenberg Field. We operate approximately 80% of all our productive wells allowing us to control the pace, costs and completion techniques used in the development of our reserves. The Wattenberg Field has a low cost structure, mature infrastructure, strong production efficiencies, multiple producing horizons, multiple service providers, established reserves and prospective drilling opportunities, which helps facilitate predictable production and reserve growth.
The challenging commodity price environment that began in late 2014 and continued through 2017 improved steadily during the majority of 2018. While commodity prices improved, they continued to be volatile. Nevertheless, we believe we remain well-positioned in this environment due to our healthy balance sheet, ample liquidity, improved inventory of economic drilling locations, and our operational flexibility which allows us to respond to commodity price fluctuations. 
During 2018, we demonstrated our operational focus on achieving best-in-class execution by lowering our cost of operations on a per unit basis. We increased drilling efficiencies and improved well performance via enhanced completion designs, which contributed to a significant growth in reserves. Additionally, we maintained our conservative balance sheet and significantly improved our available liquidity by entering into a larger, more flexible, reserve-based credit facility. We intend to continue our operational focus in 2019, emphasizing full-cycle returns and capital discipline. We will continue to monitor the ongoing commodity price environment and expect to retain the operational flexibility to adjust our drilling and completion plans in response to market conditions. 
Our Business Strategies
The Company’s primary objective is to maximize shareholder returns by responsibly developing our oil and gas resources. We seek to accomplish this through development of existing inventory and value-accretive acquisition and divestiture activity. We seek to balance production growth with maintaining a conservative balance sheet. Key aspects of our strategy include:

• | Multi-well pad development across our leasehold. We believe horizontal development is the most efficient and safest way to recover the hydrocarbons located within our leasehold. 


• | Enhanced completions. We continuously evaluate completion designs to increase well productivity and apply a multivariate regression analysis with the objective of optimizing economic returns. Petrophysical, geological and geophysical analysis is used in conjunction with spacing evaluations and individualized well designs to increase value of each spacing unit. 


• | Continuous safety improvement and strict adherence to health and safety regulations. Our goal is to utilize industry best practices to meet or exceed regulatory requirements and consistently engage stakeholders in our development planning. We strive to maintain a safe workplace for our employees and contractors at all times. 


• | Environmental stewardship. We constantly strive to control and reduce emissions and seek to comply with all applicable air quality and other environmental rules and regulations. We employ best practices including pipeline gathering and takeaway as well as vapor recovery and leak detection equipment. Additionally, we work closely with our service providers to help ensure they stay in compliance with environmental regulations when operating on our behalf. 

11


• | Disciplined approach to acquisitions and divestitures. Opportunities are evaluated in the context of maintaining development flexibility and a healthy balance sheet. We pursue value-accretive acquisitions and strive to maximize scale and minimize financial and operational risk. 


• | Prudent risk management. The Company believes a healthy balance sheet, focus on cost control, and minimizing long-term commitments are critical to controlling risk. A low debt profile and judicious use of hedging practices help reduce cash flow volatility. Continually striving to be a cost-efficient operator and maintaining a flexible capital spending program enable us to respond to changing market conditions. Hedge a portion of its production to reduce realized price volatility allowing for enhanced certainty of development program rates of return and improved capital allocation decisions. 

Significant Developments in 2018
Leadership
During 2018, the Company secured key leadership roles in order to help develop and achieve the Company's strategies. 
Effective April 11, 2018, the Company appointed Eric T. Greager as the new President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Mr. Greager has over 20 years of experience in the oil and gas industry, including exposure to both the operating and technical aspects of the industry. Mr. Greager previously served as a Vice President and General Manager at Encana Oil & Gas (USA) Inc. 
Effective November 13, 2018, the Company appointed Brant H. DeMuth as the new Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and principal financial officer of the Company. Mr. DeMuth has 34 years of management and finance experience in capital markets and the oil and gas industry. Mr. DeMuth previously served as Vice President of Finance and Treasurer at SRC Energy Inc.
Operations
In order to focus on and partially fund the development of our core assets, we divested of our Mid-Continent region and North Park Basin assets. We successfully sold our Mid-Continent assets on August 6, 2018 for net proceeds of $102.9 million which resulted in a gain of $27.3 million. The Company sold its North Park Basin assets on March 9, 2018 for minimal net proceeds and full release of all current and future obligations.
We continued to take steps to improve our access to gas processing in the DJ Basin, which resulted in improved costs, greater reliability, and greater optionality than available to many other operators in the basin while enhancing the value of our Rocky Mountain Infrastructure, LLC (“RMI”) system. RMI provides low gathering system pressures at the wellhead and access to four gas processors through eleven interconnects. This flexibility helps ensure product flow from both existing and new wells. We will continue to look for ways to improve our access to gas gathering and processing services.
Our cost reductions in 2018 were focused primarily around compression contracts, water services, labor, and well servicing. Through these cost saving efforts the Company experienced a 46% reduction in Wattenberg Field lease operating expense per Boe when comparing the fourth quarters of 2018 and 2017. Further efficiency improvements will continue to be a focus for the Company, with our per-unit costs continuing to benefit from production growth in 2019 and beyond. The Company incurred some non-recurring costs in the first half of the year, including one-time facility emissions modeling and compressor replacement costs. 
The Company accelerated its development in the DJ Basin while testing enhanced completion designs on large, efficient multi-well pads throughout the Company’s acreage position. Enhanced completion designs varied to ensure that thorough knowledge could be applied to future drilling programs. Fluid volumes and types, proppant volumes and types, stage spacing, well spacing, and flowback techniques were the primary variables that were tested throughout the 2018 program. The Company will continue to monitor industry trends, public data, and information from non-operated wells to further define optimum completion techniques. We deployed one rig in the first half of 2018 with a second rig added mid-year to coincide with our access to additional gas processing capacity. We discontinued our use of the second rig in late 2018 in response to the weakening commodity price environment. Wattenberg sales volumes increased by approximately 48% when comparing the fourth quarters of 2018 and 2017.
12

Consistent with the Company's 2018 budget, our capital program equaled approximately $275.3 million, which resulted in the drilling of 77 gross operated wells, turning to sales 41 gross operated wells and participating in the drilling and completion of one non-operated well. 
The following table summarizes our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2018:

_____________________

(1) | Proved reserves and related future net revenue and PV-10 were calculated using prices equal to the twelve-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month commodity prices for each of the preceding twelve months, which were $65.56 per Bbl WTI and $3.10 per MMBtu HH. Adjustments were then made for location, grade, transportation, gravity, and Btu content, which resulted in a decrease of $6.27 per Bbl for crude oil and a decrease of $0.82 per MMBtu for natural gas.


(2) | PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents the present value of estimated future cash inflows from proved crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquid reserves, less future development and production costs, discounted at 10% per annum to reflect timing of future cash inflows using the twelve-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month commodity prices, after adjustment for differentials in location and quality, for each of the preceding twelve months. We believe that PV-10 provides useful information to investors as it is widely used by professional analysts and sophisticated investors when evaluating oil and gas companies. We believe that PV-10 is relevant and useful for evaluating the relative monetary significance of our reserves. Professional analysts and sophisticated investors may utilize the measure as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our reserves to other companies’ reserves. Because there are many unique factors that can impact an individual company when estimating the amount of future income taxes to be paid, we believe the use of a pre-tax measure is valuable in evaluating the Company and our reserves. PV-10 is not intended to represent the current market value of our estimated reserves. PV-10 differs from Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows (“Standardized Measure”) because it does not include the effect of future income taxes. Please refer to the Reconciliation of PV-10 to Standardized Measure presented in the “Reserves” subsection of Item 1 below.


(3) | Mid-Continent sales volumes were 1,728 Boe/d for 2018, which is comprised of 1,550 Boe/d of production net to our interest and 178 Boe/d sales volumes from our percentage-of-proceeds contracts. We sold all of our assets within the Mid-Continent region on August 6, 2018.

(4) | The Company has 444.5 standard reach lateral equivalent gross proved undeveloped drilling locations as of December 31, 2018.

Our Operations
As of December 31, 2018, our operations are solely focused in the rural portions of the Wattenberg Field in the Rocky Mountain region. The Company sold all of its assets within the Mid-Continent region and North Park Basin on August 6, 2018 and March 9, 2018, respectively.
Rocky Mountain Region
Our Rocky Mountain Region consists of one operating area in the Wattenberg Field in Weld County, Colorado. As of December 31, 2018, our estimated proved reserves in the Rocky Mountain region were 116,785 MBoe, which represented 100% of our total estimated proved reserves and contributed 15,844 Boe/d, or 90%, of sales volumes during 2018.
Wattenberg Field - Weld County, Colorado.  Our operations are located in the rural portions of the oil and liquids-weighted extension area of the Wattenberg Field targeting the Niobrara and Codell formations. As of December 31, 2018, our Wattenberg position consisted of approximately 92,000 gross (65,000 net) acres. 
The Wattenberg Field is now primarily developed for the Niobrara and Codell formations using horizontal drilling and multi-stage fracture stimulation techniques. We believe the Niobrara B and C benches have been fully delineated on our legacy acreage, while the Codell formation has been delineated on our western legacy acreage. Our northern and southern acreage positions are currently being delineated. 
As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of 695 gross producing wells, of which 507 were horizontal wells. Our sales volumes for the fourth quarter of 2018 were 17,748 Boe/d. As of December 31, 2018, our working interest for all producing wells averaged approximately 80% and our net revenue interest was approximately 66%.
We drilled and participated in drilling 116.5 gross (92.2 net) standard reach lateral (“SRL”) equivalent wells in 2018 in the Wattenberg Field. As of December 31, 2018, we have an identified drilling inventory of approximately 300 gross (200.3 net) proved undeveloped (“PUD”) drilling locations (444.5 gross SRL equivalents) on our acreage. 
The following table summarizes our drilling and completion activity for SRL wells, medium reach lateral wells (“MRL”), and extended reach laterals wells (“XRL”) on a gross basis for the year ended December 31, 2018.

 | SRL | MRL | | XRL 
 | Drilled | Completed | | Drilled | Completed | Drilled | | Completed
Niobrara - Operated | 34 | | 16 | | 7 | | 2 | | 33 | 20
Codell - Operated | 2 | | 3 | | — | | — | | 1 | — 
Niobrara - Non-operated | — | | — | | — | | — | | 1 | 1 

The Company’s Rocky Mountain Infrastructure (“RMI”) gathering asset has eleven interconnects to four independent gas processors. This system improves flow assurance and operates at relatively low line pressure at the wellhead. Reduced gathering system pressure at the wellhead enhances well performance and the system’s interconnects provide for delivery flexibility, enabling the Company to maximize available price realizations.
The Company’s 2019 capital budget contemplates the continuous use of one drilling rig. The rig is scheduled to drill large-scale five to eighteen well pads throughout our legacy west, central and east acreage position. The Company plans to complete wells in 2019 using slickwater designs similar to the techniques used in 2018 that resulted in significant well improvements. The Company will continue to remain agile and modify drilling and completion techniques as additional data from both operated and non-operated wells becomes available.
Assuming a one rig drilling program, the Company anticipates 2019 Wattenberg production growth to be greater than 30% year-over-year as compared to Wattenberg-only production realized in 2018. Furthermore, the Company anticipates being able to grow Wattenberg production by approximately 20% in 2020 as compared to 2019 using a one-and-a-half operated rig program.
14

Our drilling and completion capital investment in 2019 is expected to be approximately $210.0 million to $220.0 million, which will support drilling 59 gross wells and turning to sales 45 gross wells. This drilling and completion capital budget includes an estimated $15.0 million for non-operated activity. An additional $20.0 million to $35.0 million in capital is contemplated for investments in infrastructure, land, and seismic. The 2019 drilling and completion program by well type is presented in the following table.

 | SRL | MRL | | XRL 
 | Drilled | Completed | | Drilled | Completed | Drilled | | Completed
Niobrara | 33 | | 24 | | — | | 5 | | 26 | 16

North Park Basin - Jackson County, Colorado. We successfully sold all of our North Park assets on March 9, 2018 for minimal net proceeds and full release of all current and future obligations. Our sales volumes for 2018, prior to the divestiture, were10 Boe/d.
Mid-Continent Region
We successfully sold our Mid-Continent assets on August 6, 2018 for $117.0 million, prior to customary closing adjustments, which resulted in net proceeds of $102.9 million. We achieved a sales volume rate for 2018 of 1,728 Boe/d prior to the divestiture, or 10% of sales volume for 2018. At December 31, 2017, the Company had 300 gross producing vertical wells and proved reserves of approximately 10,419 MBoe. 
Reserves
Estimated Proved Reserves
The summary data with respect to our estimated proved reserves presented below has been prepared in accordance with rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) applicable to companies involved in oil and natural gas producing activities. Our reserve estimates do not include probable or possible reserves. Our estimated proved reserves for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were determined using the preceding twelve month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month prices. For a definition of proved reserves under the SEC rules, please see the Glossary of Oil and Natural Gas Terms included in the beginning of this report.
Reserve estimates are inherently imprecise, and estimates for undeveloped properties are more imprecise than reserve estimates for producing oil and gas properties. Accordingly, all of these estimates are expected to change as new information becomes available. The PV-10 values shown in the following table are not intended to represent the current market value of our estimated proved reserves. Neither prices nor costs have been escalated. The actual quantities and present values of our estimated proved reserves may vary from what we have estimated. 
The table below summarizes our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 for each of the regions and currently producing fields in which we operate. The proved reserve estimates as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 were prepared by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (“NSAI”), our third-party independent reserve engineers. The proved reserves as of December 31, 2016 are based on reports prepared by our internal corporate reservoir engineering group, of which 100% were audited by NSAI. For more information regarding our independent reserve engineers, please see Independent Reserve Engineers below. The information in the following table is not intended to represent the current market value of our proved reserves nor does it give any effect to or reflect our commodity derivatives or current commodity prices.

(1) | Proved reserves were calculated using the preceding twelve month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month prices, which were $65.56 per Bbl WTI and $3.10 per MMBtu HH, $51.34 per Bbl WTI and $2.98 per MMBtu HH, and $42.75 per Bbl WTI and $2.48 per MMBtu HH for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Adjustments were made for location and grade.


(2) | Determined using the ratio of 6 Mcf of natural gas to one Bbl of crude oil.

Proved developed oil and gas reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for completion. Proved undeveloped reserves on undrilled acreage are limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic productivity at greater distances. 
Proved undeveloped locations in our December 31, 2018 reserve report are included in our development plan and are 
16

scheduled to be drilled within five years from the date they were initially recorded. The Company’s management evaluated the proved undeveloped drilling plan using NYMEX strip prices, the liquidation model for general and administrative costs, updated capital expenditures and lease operating costs to match revised bids and actuals from year-end. The reserve report factored in a one-rig program for 2019, a one-and-a-half rig program in 2020, and two rigs starting in the second half of 2022, which allows all PUDs to be drilled within the allotted five-year window. We typically book proved undeveloped locations within one development spacing area from developed producing locations. For the instances where a proved undeveloped location is beyond one spacing area from a developed producing location, we utilized reliable geologic and engineering technology. The reliable technologies used to establish our proved reserves are a combination of pressure performance, geologic mapping, offset productivity, electric logs, seismic, and production data.
As of December 31, 2018, the total proved undeveloped gross location count in our Wattenberg Field was 300.0 (444.5 SRL equivalents), compared to 205.0 (248.0 SRL equivalents) gross location counts as of December 31, 2017. Our five-year drilling program captures these proved undeveloped locations. For the year ending December 31, 2018, approximately 60% of the proved undeveloped locations are spaced on 80 acres within a single bench and approximately 40% are planned to be drilled on 80/40 geometry, which involves drilling wells on 80 acre spacing on each of two benches with a 40 acre offset between wells on the upper and lower bench.
The Company-wide and Wattenberg Field estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2018 were 116.8 MMBoe, a 14% and 29% increase from the Company-wide and Wattenberg Field estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2017, respectively. The net increase in our Company-wide reserves of 14.8 MMBoe is the result of a 28.8 MMBoe increase from PUD and capital additions, coupled with a 3.8 MMBoe increase in cost and engineering revisions, and a 2.3 MMBoe increase due to pricing, offset by divested reserves of 11.2 MMBoe, 2.5 MMBoe of undeveloped reserves removed from our five-year drilling program, and 2018 production of 6.4 MMBoe. 
Positive adjustments to the estimated proved reserves during 2018 consisted of pricing and LOE changes, reserve additions from capital and PUD developments, and engineering revisions. The positive pricing revision of 2,333 Mboe resulted from an increase in average commodity price from $51.34 per Bbl WTI and $2.98 per MMBtu HH for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $65.56 per Bbl WTI and $3.10 per MMBtu HH for the year ended December 31, 2018. The 1,536 MBoe LOE revision is due to continued decreases in LOE as a result of numerous cost-cutting initiatives completed over the past few years. The 28,832 Mboe in PUD and capital additions is the result of turning to sales 41 operated horizontal locations in the Niobrara and Codell formations in the Wattenberg Field during 2018 and adding infill and extension PUD locations that are on the 2019 rig schedule.
Estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2017 were 102.0 MMBoe, a 13% increase from estimated proved reserves of 90.7 MMBoe at December 31, 2016. Approximately 89% of our December 31, 2017 proved reserves were attributed to the Rocky Mountain region, and 99.8% of the Rocky Mountain proved reserves were attributed to the Wattenberg Field. The net increase in our reserves of 11.3 MMBoe was the result of a 15.5 MMBoe increase from PUD and capital additions, coupled with a 7.1 MMBoe increase in net positive cost revisions (reserve prices less drilling and completion costs and LOE), and a 2.1 MMBoe increase due to positive engineering revisions, offset by PUD demotions of 7.6 MMBoe and 2017 production of 5.7 MMBoe. 
Positive adjustments to the estimated proved reserves during 2017 consisted of pricing and LOE changes, reserve additions from capital and PUD developments, and engineering revisions. The positive pricing revision of 5,405 Mboe resulted from an increase in average commodity price from $42.75 per Bbl WTI and $2.48 per MMBtu HH for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $51.34 per Bbl WTI and $2.98 per MMBtu HH for the year ended December 31, 2017. The 1,672 MBoe LOE revision was due to continued decreased LOE as a result of numerous cost-cutting initiatives completed over the past few years. The 15,547 Mboe in PUD and capital additions was the result of turning to sales 10 operated and 24 non-operated unproved horizontal locations in the Niobrara and Codell formations in the Wattenberg Field during 2017 and adding infill PUD locations that were the 2018 rig schedule, offset by PUD locations that were removed due to a shift within our development strategy. 
Estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2016 were 90.7 MMBoe, a 10% decrease from estimated proved reserves of 101.3 MMBoe at December 31, 2015. The net decrease in our reserves of 10.6 MMBoe was the result of 2016 production of 7.8 MMBoe coupled with writing off 16.4 MMBoe of PUDs and 1.9 MMBoe of other engineering revisions, offset by additions in extensions, discoveries, and infills of 10.8 MMBoe and net positive cost revisions (reserve prices less drilling and completion costs and LOE) of 4.7 MMBoe. 
The 10.8 MMBoe addition in extensions, discoveries, and infills in 2016 was primarily the result of turning to sales five operated and six non-operated unproved horizontal locations in the Niobrara formation that were in progress at year-end 2015, and drilling and completing three non-operated unproved horizontal wells and one operated unproved vertical well in the 
17

Niobrara formation in the Wattenberg Field during 2016. In 2016 our five-year drilling plan was adjusted to focus on locations that were adjacent to existing production facilities. As a result, 42 PUD locations were added and 38 PUD locations under the prior plan were removed.
Total Company positive engineering revisions as of December 31, 2016, were 28,625 Mboe, of which 32,899 Mboe were related to positive reserve changes in the Wattenberg Field and 4,416 Mboe were related to negative reserve changes in the Dorcheat Macedonia Field. The overall positive engineering revision is offset by a negative pricing revision of 39,222 Mboe in the Wattenberg Field and 2,778 Mboe in the Dorcheat Macedonia Field. The negative pricing revision of 42,143 Mboe for the Company resulted from a decrease in average commodity price from $50.28 per Bbl WTI and $2.59 per MMBtu HH for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $42.75 per Bbl WTI and $2.48 per MMBtu HH for the year ended December 31, 2016. The majority of the positive revisions in the Wattenberg Field resulted from a combination of decreased drilling and completion costs and a continued decrease in LOE, which had begun in 2015. Our total proved undeveloped location count in the Wattenberg Field as of December 31, 2016 was 210 (226 standard reach lateral equivalents) and 204 as of December 31, 2015. 
Reconciliation of PV-10 to Standardized Measure
PV-10 is derived from the Standardized Measure, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. PV-10 is a computation of the Standardized Measure on a pre-tax basis. PV-10 is equal to the Standardized Measure at the applicable date, before deducting future income taxes, discounted at 10%. We believe that the presentation of PV-10 is relevant and useful to investors because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our estimated net proved reserves prior to taking into account future corporate income taxes, and it is a useful measure for evaluating the relative monetary significance of our oil and natural gas properties. We use this measure when assessing the potential return on investment related to our oil and natural gas properties. PV-10, however, is not a substitute for the Standardized Measure. Neither our PV-10 measure or the Standardized Measure purport to present the fair value of our oil and natural gas reserves.
The following table provides a reconciliation of PV-10 to Standardized Measure at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:

 | December 31, 
 | 2018 | | 2017 | 2016

____________________________
(1) The tax basis of our oil and gas properties as of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 provides more tax deduction than income generated from our oil and gas properties when the reserve estimates were prepared using $65.56 per Bbl WTI and $3.10 per MMBTU HH, $51.34 per Bbl WTI and $2.98 per MMBtu HH, and $42.75 per Bbl WTI and $2.48 per MMBtu HH, respectively.

At December 31, 2018, our proved undeveloped reserves were 68,086 MBoe, all of which are scheduled to be drilled within five years from the date they were initially recorded. During 2018, the Company converted 18% of its proved undeveloped reserves (29 gross wells representing net reserves of 8,643 MBoe) at a cost of $127.8 million. The net increase of 27,978 Mboe in PUD additions is the result of adding 92 XRL and 18 SRL infill PUD locations in the Company's southern “French Lake” area and 14 XRL and 12 SRL PUD locations in other areas that are captured in our five-year drilling program. Twelve PUD locations were removed from our reserve base as they were no longer part of our five-year drilling program.
At December 31, 2017, our proved undeveloped reserves were 48,082 MBoe, all of which were scheduled to be drilled within five years of their initial proved booking date. During 2017, the Company converted 6% of its proved undeveloped reserves (seven gross wells representing net reserves of 2,196 MBoe) at a cost of $26.1 million. The net increase of 4,140 Mboe in PUD additions are the result of adding infill PUD locations that were on the 2018 rig schedule, offset by PUD locations that were removed due to a changes in our development strategy. The increase in revisions was primarily due to the forecasted production uplift resulting from enhanced completion designs. 
At December 31, 2016, our proved undeveloped reserves were 40,057 MBoe, all of which were scheduled to be drilled within five years of their initial proved booking date. During 2016, the Company converted 3% of its proved undeveloped reserves (seven gross wells representing net reserves of 1,352 MBoe) at a cost of $16.2 million. Our 2016 capital program was suspended after the first quarter, and no proved undeveloped locations were added as a result of drilling. The net decrease in our PUD reserves from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016 was mainly the result of removing 7.8 MMBoe of PUDs in the Mid-Continent region, as drilling focus shifted entirely to the Wattenberg Field. Thirty-eight Wattenberg proved undeveloped locations not within areas in close proximity to existing CPFs were demoted and were replaced with 42 infill proved undeveloped locations that were near existing CPFs. 
Internal controls over reserves estimation process
Our policies regarding internal controls over the recording of reserves estimates require reserves to be in compliance with SEC definitions and guidance and prepared in accordance with Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. The Company’s Reserves Committee reviews significant reserve changes on an annual basis and our third-party independent reserve engineers, NSAI, is engaged by and has direct access to the Reserves Committee. The reserves estimates for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 shown herein have been independently prepared by NSAI. These NSAI reserve estimates are reviewed by our in-house petroleum engineer who oversees and controls preparation of the reserve report data by working with NSAI to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data furnished to NSAI for their evaluation process. The Company's technical person who was primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserve estimates was our Manager of Corporate Reserves who has over 30 years of experience in the oil and gas industry, including four years in her role at the Company. Her professional qualifications include a bachelor's degree in Petroleum Engineering from the University of Wyoming and a master's degree in Petroleum Engineering from the Colorado School of Mines.
For the year ended December 31, 2016 the Company prepared the reserves estimate, which were audited by NSAI. The responsibility for compliance in reserves estimation was delegated to our internal corporate reservoir engineering group. The Company's Corporate Reserves Manager, at that time, had a Bachelor of Science degree in Geological Engineering and a Master of Science degree in Mineral Economics from the Colorado School of Mines and had been in the petroleum industry for 41 years. Our internal corporate reservoir engineering group had over 85 years of industry experience.

Both technical principals meet or exceed the education, training, and experience requirements set forth 
19

in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers; both are proficient in judiciously applying industry standard practices to engineering and geoscience evaluations as well as applying SEC and other industry reserves definitions and guidelines.
Production, Revenues and Price History
Oil and gas prices fluctuated significantly during 2018 and the beginning of 2019. Oil prices are impacted by production levels, crude oil inventories, real or perceived geopolitical risks in oil producing regions, the relative strength of the U.S. dollar, weather and the global economy. During periods of favorable pricing, we expect increased industry activity, which could moderate the magnitude of price increases throughout the year.
Sensitivity Analysis 
If oil and natural gas SEC prices declined by 10%, our proved reserve volumes would decrease by 0.3% and our PV-10 value as of December 31, 2018 would decrease by approximately 23% or $223.1 million. If oil and natural gas SEC prices increased by 10%, our proved reserve volumes would increase by 0.4% and our PV-10 value as of December 31, 2018 would increase by approximately 24% or $229.8 million.
Production
The following table sets forth information regarding oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids production, sales prices, and production costs for the periods indicated. For additional information on price calculations, please see information set forth in Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Principal Customers
One of our customers, NGL Crude Logistics, LLC comprised 66% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. No other single non-affiliated customer accounted for 10% or more of our oil and natural gas sales in 2018. We believe the loss of any one customer would not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations because there are numerous potential customers for our product.

Delivery Commitments
The Company entered into a new purchase agreement upon emergence from bankruptcy. The terms of the agreement consists of defined volume commitments over an initial seven-year term. The Company will be required to make periodic deficiency payments for any shortfalls in delivering minimum volume commitments, which are set in six-month periods beginning in January 2018. The Company's capital program is designed to exceed these minimum volume commitments. During 2018, the average minimum volume commitment was approximately 10,100 barrels per day and increased by approximately 41% from 2018 to 2019 and approximately 3% each year thereafter for the remainder of the contract, to a maximum of approximately 16,000 barrels per day. The aggregate financial commitment fee over the seven-year term, based on the minimum volume commitment schedule (as defined in the agreement) and the applicable differential fee, is $136.3 million as of December 31, 2018. Please refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 8 - Commitments and Contingencies for additional discussion.

Undeveloped acreage
We critically review and consider at-risk leasehold with attention to our ability either to convert term leasehold to held-by-production status or obtain term extensions. Decisions to let leasehold expire generally relate to areas outside of our core area of development or when the expirations do not pose material impacts to development plans or reserves.
The following table sets forth the number of net undeveloped acres by area as of December 31, 2018 that will expire over the next three years unless production is established within the spacing units covering the acreage or the applicable leases are extended prior to the expiration dates:

Capital Expenditure Budget
The Company's 2019 capital budget of $230.0 million to $255.0 million assumes a continuous one-rig development pace. The drilling and completion portion of the budget is expected to be approximately $210.0 million to $220.0 million, which will support drilling 59 gross wells and turning to sales 45 gross wells. Included in the drilling completion budget is $15.0 million for non-operated capital. Of the operated wells planned to be drilled, approximately 26 are XRL wells and 33 are SRL wells. Of the wells planned to be completed, 16 are XRL wells, five are MRL wells, and 24 are SRL wells. The remaining 2019 capital budget of $20.0 million to $35.0 million is to support infrastructure and leasehold costs. Actual capital expenditures could vary significantly based on, among other things, market conditions, commodity prices, drilling and completion costs, well results, and changes in the borrowing base under our Current Credit Facility.
Derivative Activity 
In addition to supply and demand, oil and gas prices are affected by seasonal, economic, local and geo-political factors that we can neither control nor predict. We attempt to mitigate a portion of our exposure to potentially adverse market changes in commodity prices and the associated impact on cash flows through the use of derivative contracts. We have successfully hedged approximately 54% and 59% of our average 2019 guided production as of December 31, 2018 and as of the filing date of this report, respectively.
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had entered into the following commodity derivative contracts:

Bankruptcy Proceedings under Chapter 11
On January 4, 2017, the Company and all of its direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively, the “Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions under Chapter 11 in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the “Bankruptcy Court”). The Debtors received bankruptcy court confirmation of their Third Amended Joint Prepackaged Plan of Reorganization, dated April 6, 2017 (the “Plan”), and emerged from bankruptcy on April 28, 2017 (the “Effective Date”). For additional information about our bankruptcy proceedings and emergence, please refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 15 - Chapter 11 Proceedings and Emergence.
24

Upon emergence from bankruptcy, the Company adopted fresh-start accounting and became a new entity for financial reporting purposes. Upon adoption of fresh-start accounting, our assets and liabilities were recorded at their fair values as of the Effective Date, which differed materially from the recorded values of those same assets and liabilities in the Predecessor Company.

Title to Properties
Our properties are subject to customary royalty interests, overriding royalty interests, obligations incident to operating agreements, liens for current taxes, other industry‑related constraints, and certain other leasehold restrictions. We do not believe that any of these burdens materially interfere with our use of the properties in the operation of our business. We believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our producing properties. We undergo a thorough title review process upon receipt of title opinions received from outside legal counsel before we commence drilling operations. Although title to our properties is subject to complex interpretation of multiple conveyances, deeds, reservations, and other instruments that serve to affect mineral title, we believe that none of these risks will materially detract from the value of our properties or from our interest therein or otherwise materially interfere with the operation of our business.
Competition
The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive, and we compete with a substantial number of other companies that often have greater resources. Many of these companies explore for, produce, and market oil and natural gas, carry on refining operations, and market the resultant products on a worldwide basis. The primary areas in which we encounter substantial competition are in locating and acquiring desirable leasehold acreage for our drilling and development operations, locating and acquiring attractive producing oil and gas properties, attracting and retaining qualified personnel, and obtaining transportation for the oil and gas we produce in certain regions. There is also competition between producers of oil and gas and other industries producing alternative energy and fuel. Furthermore, competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and/or regulation considered from time to time by federal, state, and local governments; however, it is not possible to predict the nature of any such legislation or regulation that may ultimately be adopted or its effects upon our future operations. Such laws and regulations may, however, substantially increase the costs of exploring for, developing, or producing gas and oil and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuation of a given operation. The effect and potential impacts of these risks are difficult to accurately predict.
Further, oil prices and natural gas prices do not necessarily fluctuate in direct relationship to each other. Because approximately 76% of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2018 were oil and natural gas liquids reserves, our financial results are more sensitive to movements in oil prices. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the daily NYMEX WTI oil spot price ranged from a high of $77.41 per Bbl to a low of $44.48 per Bbl, and the NYMEX natural gas HH spot price ranged from a high of $6.24 per MMBtu to a low of $2.49 per MMBtu. 
Insurance Matters
As is common in the oil and gas industry, we will not insure fully against all risks associated with our business, either because such insurance is not available or customary, or because premium costs are considered cost prohibitive. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry
Our operations are substantially affected by federal, state, and local laws and regulations. In particular, oil and natural gas production and related operations are, or have been, subject to price controls, taxes, and numerous other laws and regulations. The jurisdiction in which we own and operate properties or assets for oil and natural gas production has statutory provisions regulating the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas, including, among other things, provisions related to permits for the drilling of wells, bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, sourcing and disposal of 
25

water used in the drilling and completion process, and the abandonment of wells. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These include regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the number of wells which may be drilled in an area, and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas wells, and regulations that generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and that impose certain requirements regarding the ratability or fair apportionment of production from fields and individual wells.
Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties. Our competitors in the oil and natural gas industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations. The regulatory burden on the industry can increase the cost of doing business and negatively affect profitability. Because such laws and regulations are frequently revised and amended through various legislative actions and rulemakings, it is difficult to predict the future costs or impact of compliance. Additional rulemakings that affect the oil and natural gas industry are regularly considered at the federal, state, and various local government levels, including statutorily and through powers granted to various agencies that regulate our industry, and various court actions. We cannot predict when or whether any such rulemakings may become effective or if the outcomes will negatively affect our operations.
We believe that continued substantial compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. However, current regulatory requirements may change, currently unforeseen incidents may occur, or past noncompliance with laws or regulations may be discovered.
Regulation of production
The production of oil and natural gas is subject to regulation under a wide range of local, state, and federal statutes, rules, orders, and regulations. Federal, state, and local statutes and regulations require, among other things, permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds, and reports concerning operations. Colorado, the state in which we own and operate all of our properties, has regulations governing conservation matters, including provisions for the spacing and unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the regulation of well spacing and well density, and procedures for proper plugging and abandonment of wells. The intent of these regulations is to promote the efficient recovery of oil and gas reserves while reducing waste and protecting correlative rights. By collaborating with industry’s exploration and development operations, these regulations effectively identify where wells can be drilled, well densities by geologic formation, and the appropriate spacing and pooling unit size to effectively drain the resources. Operators can apply for exceptions to such regulations, including applications to increase well densities to more effectively recover the oil and gas resources. Moreover, Colorado imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction.
We own interests in properties located onshore in one U.S. state, Colorado. This state regulates drilling and operating activities by requiring, among other things, permits for the drilling of wells, maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells, and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, and the plugging and abandonment of wells. Colorado laws also govern a number of environmental and conservation matters, including the handling and disposal of waste materials, air pollution, the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the density of wells that may be drilled, and the unitization and pooling of oil and gas properties. 
Regulation of transportation of oil
Our sales of crude oil are affected by the availability, terms, and cost of transportation. Interstate transportation of oil by pipeline is regulated by FERC pursuant to the Interstate Commerce Act (“ICA”), the Energy Policy Act of 1992, and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws. The ICA and its implementing regulations require that tariff rates for interstate service on oil pipelines, including interstate pipelines that transport crude oil and refined products (collectively referred to as “petroleum pipelines”), be just and reasonable and non‑discriminatory and that such rates and terms and conditions of service be filed with FERC.
Intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates, varies from state to state. Insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any way that is materially different from how it affects operations of our competitors who are similarly situated.

Regulation of transportation and sales of natural gas
Historically, the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce have been regulated by agencies of the U.S. federal government, primarily FERC. FERC regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions, which affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas.
In the past, the federal government has regulated the prices at which natural gas could be sold. While sales by producers of natural gas can currently be made at uncontrolled market prices, Congress could reenact price controls in the future. Deregulation of wellhead natural gas sales began with the enactment of the Natural Gas Policy Act (“NGPA”) and culminated in adoption of the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act which removed controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective January 1, 1993. The transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce is regulated primarily under the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”), and by regulations and orders promulgated under the NGA by FERC. In certain limited circumstances, intrastate transportation and wholesale sales of natural gas may also be affected directly or indirectly by laws enacted by Congress and by FERC regulations.
FERC issued a series of orders in 1996 and 1997 to implement its open access policies. As a result, the interstate pipelines’ traditional role as wholesalers of natural gas has been greatly reduced and replaced by a structure under which pipelines provide transportation and storage service on an open access basis to others who buy and sell natural gas. Although FERC’s orders do not directly regulate natural gas producers, they are intended to foster increased competition within all phases of the natural gas industry.
The Domenici Barton Energy Policy Act of 2005 (“EP Act of 2005”) is a comprehensive compilation of tax incentives, authorized appropriations for grants and guaranteed loans, and significant changes to the statutory policy that affects all segments of the energy industry. Among other matters, the EP Act of 2005 amends the NGA to add an anti-market manipulation provision which makes it unlawful for any entity to engage in prohibited behavior to be prescribed by FERC. The EP Act of 2005 provides FERC with the power to assess civil penalties of up to $1,000,000 per day for violations of the NGA and increases FERC’s civil penalty authority under the NGPA from $5,000 per violation per day to $1,000,000 per violation per day. The civil penalty provisions are applicable to entities that engage in the sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce. On January 19, 2006, FERC issued Order No. 670, a rule implementing the anti-market manipulation provision of the EP Act of 2005, and subsequently denied rehearing. The rules make it unlawful, in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation more accessible to natural gas services subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, for any entity, directly or indirectly, (1) to use or employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud; (2) to make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or (3) to engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. The new anti-market manipulation rule does not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional sales or gathering, but does apply to activities of gas pipelines and storage companies that provide interstate services, as well as otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted “in connection with” gas sales, purchases, or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction, which now includes the annual reporting requirements under Order 704. The anti-market manipulation rule and enhanced civil penalty authority reflect an expansion of FERC’s NGA enforcement authority.
Gathering service, which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services, is regulated by the states onshore and in state waters. Although its policy is still in flux, FERC has reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as non-jurisdictional gathering facilities, which has the tendency to increase our costs of getting gas to point-of-sale locations. State regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental, and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory-take requirements. Although nondiscriminatory-take regulation has not generally been affirmatively applied by state agencies, natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny in the future.
Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by FERC as a natural gas company under the NGA. We believe that the natural gas pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional tests FERC has used to establish a pipeline’s status as a gatherer not subject to regulation as a natural gas company. However, the distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is the subject of ongoing litigation, so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by FERC, the courts, or Congress.
Our sales of natural gas are also subject to requirements under the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”), and regulations promulgated thereunder by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”). The CEA prohibits any person from manipulating or attempting to manipulate the price of any commodity in interstate commerce or futures on such 
27

commodity. The CEA also prohibits knowingly delivering or causing to be delivered false or misleading or knowingly inaccurate reports concerning market information or conditions that affect or tend to affect the price of a commodity.
Intrastate natural gas transportation is also subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies. The basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state. Insofar as such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate natural gas shippers within the state on a comparable basis, we believe that the regulation of similarly situated intrastate natural gas transportation in the state in which we operate and ship natural gas on an intrastate basis will not affect our operations in any way that is materially different from how it affects operations of our competitors. Like the regulation of interstate transportation rates, the regulation of intrastate transportation rates affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas.
Changes in law and to FERC policies and regulations may adversely affect the availability and reliability of firm and/or interruptible transportation service on interstate pipelines, and we cannot predict what future action FERC will take. We do not believe, however, that any regulatory changes will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way they will affect other natural gas producers, gatherers, and marketers with which we compete.
Regulation of derivatives 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was passed by Congress and signed into law in July 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act is designed to provide a comprehensive framework for the regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market with the intent to provide greater transparency and reduction of risk between counterparties. The Dodd-Frank Act subjects swap dealers and major swap participants to capital and margin requirements and requires many derivative transactions to be cleared on exchanges. The Dodd-Frank Act provides for a potential exemption from these clearing and cash collateral requirements for commercial end-users. 
Environmental, Health and Safety Regulation
Our natural gas and oil exploration and production operations are subject to numerous stringent federal, regional, state, and local laws and regulations governing safety and health, the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to protection of the environment or natural resources, noncompliance with which can result in substantial administrative, civil, and criminal penalties and other sanctions, including suspension or cessation of operations. These laws and regulations may, among other things, require the acquisition of permits before drilling or other regulated activity commences; restrict the types, quantities, and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment; govern the sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process; limit or prohibit drilling activities that impact threatened or endangered species or that occur in certain areas and on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, frontier, and other protected areas; require some form of investigation or remedial action to prevent or mitigate pollution from former operations such as plugging abandoned wells or closing earthen pits; establish specific safety and health criteria addressing worker and natural resource protection and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations or failure to comply with regulatory filing obligations. Cumulatively, these laws and regulations may impact our rate of production.
The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations to which we are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations, or financial position.
Air emissions
The Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and comparable state laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, including oil and gas operations, and impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and comply with stringent air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. Obtaining required air permits can significantly delay the development of certain oil and natural gas projects. Over the next several years, we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions related issues.
For example, on August 16, 2012, the EPA published final rules under the CAA that subject oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, and storage operations to regulation under the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAP”) programs. These regulations establish specific new requirements regarding emissions 
28

from production-related wet seal and reciprocating compressors and from certain pneumatic controllers and storage vessels. The EPA issued revised rules in 2013 and 2014 in response to requests for reconsideration of portions the 2012 NESHAP rules from industry and the environmental community. In May 2016, the EPA issued New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) rules focused on achieving additional methane and volatile organic compound reductions from oil and natural gas operations. Among other things, these revisions impose new requirements for leak detection and repair, control requirements for oil well completions, and additional control requirements for gathering, boosting, and compressor stations. EPA proposed further revisions to the NSPS rules on September 11, 2018 intended to roll back parts of the 2016 rules. The proposed revisions address certain technical issues raised in administrative petitions and include proposed changes to, among other things, the frequency for monitoring fugitive emissions at well sites and compressor stations.
In February 2014, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment’s Air Quality Control Commission (“AQCC”) adopted new and revised air quality regulations that impose stringent new requirements to control emissions from both existing and new or modified oil and gas facilities in Colorado. The regulations include new emissions control, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements on oil and gas operators in Colorado. For example, the regulations impose Storage Tank Emission Management (“STEM”) requirements for certain new and existing storage tanks. The STEM requirements require us to install costly emission control technologies as well as monitoring and recordkeeping programs at most of our new and existing well production facilities. The new Colorado regulations also impose a Leak Detection and Repair (“LDAR”) program for well production facilities and compressor stations. The LDAR program primarily targets hydrocarbon (i.e., methane) emissions from the oil and gas sector in Colorado and represents a significant new use of state authority regarding these emissions. 
On October 1, 2015, EPA finalized its rule lowering the existing 75 part per billion (“ppb”) national ambient air quality standard (“NAAQS”) for ozone under the CAA to 70 ppb. Also in 2015, the state of Colorado received a bump-up in its existing ozone standard non-attainment status from “marginal” to “moderate.” Oil and natural gas operations in ozone non-attainment areas, including in the DM/NFR area, may be subject to increased regulatory burdens in the form of more stringent emission controls, emission offset requirements, and increased permitting delays and costs. Based on 2018 air quality monitoring data, the DM/NFR area may be reclassified to “serious” non-attainment on January 1, 2020 because the area does not meet the 2008 NAAQS for 2018. A “serious” classification would trigger significant additional obligations for the state under the CAA and could result in new and more stringent air quality control requirements applicable to our operations and significant operating costs and delays in obtaining necessary permits for new and modified production facilities. 
In May 2016, the EPA also finalized a rule regarding source determination, including defining the term “adjacent” under the CAA, which affects how major sources are defined, particularly regarding criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air quality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and natural gas industry. This rule could cause small facilities, on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major sources, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting requirements. These EPA rulemakings will have nominal effect on our operations, because the rule clarified our existing presumption on “adjacent” and presents no conflict with the state of Colorado definitions.
The EPA also published Control Technique Guidelines (“CTGs”) in October 2016 aimed at providing states with guidance and setting a presumptive floor for Reasonably Achievable Control Technology (“RACT”) for the oil and gas industry in areas of ozone non-attainment, including the DM/NFR area. In November 2017, as required following issuance of the CTGs, the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission AQCC adopted additional RACT and other air quality regulations that increased emissions control, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements on oil and gas operators in the DM/NFR area, and to some extent state-wide.
Compliance with these and other air pollution control and permitting requirements has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects and increase our costs of development and production, which costs could be significant.
Hydraulic fracturing
Regulations relating to hydraulic fracturing. We are subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and regulations concerning health, safety, and environmental protection. Government authorities frequently add to those requirements, and both oil and gas development generally and hydraulic fracturing specifically are receiving increasing regulatory attention. Our operations utilize hydraulic fracturing, an important and commonly used process in the completion of oil and natural gas wells in low-permeability formations. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, proppant, and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate hydrocarbon production.
States have historically regulated oil and gas exploration and production activity, including hydraulic fracturing. State governments in the areas where we operate have adopted or are considering adopting additional requirements relating to 
29

hydraulic fracturing that could restrict its use in certain circumstances or make it more costly to utilize. Such measures may address any risk to drinking water, the potential for hydrocarbon migration, the disclosure of the chemicals used in fracturing, or other matters. Colorado, for example, comprehensively updated its oil and gas regulations in 2008 and adopted significant additional amendments in 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2018. Among other things, the updated and amended regulations require operators to reduce methane emissions associated with hydraulic fracturing, compile and report additional information regarding wellbore integrity, publicly disclose the chemical ingredients used in hydraulic fracturing, increase the minimum distance between occupied structures and oil and gas wells, undertake additional mitigation for nearby residents, implement additional groundwater testing, undertake certain measures to minimize flood risks, and comply with new requirements for the installation and operation of flowlines. In 2014, Colorado enacted legislation to increase the potential sanctions for statutory, regulatory and other violations. Among other things, this legislation and its implementing regulations mandate monetary penalties for certain types of violations, require a penalty to be assessed for each day of violation and significantly increase the maximum daily penalty amount. Colorado has also expanded its inspection and enforcement of staff. In early 2016, Colorado adopted rules imposing additional permitting requirements for certain large scale facilities in urban mitigation areas and additional notice requirements prior to engaging in operations near certain municipalities. Any enforcement actions or requirements of additional studies or investigations by governmental authorities where we operate could increase our operating costs and cause delays or interruptions of our operations. In 2018, Colorado adopted rules requiring new wells and production facilities to be sited at least 1,000 feet from school facilities and child care centers.
The federal Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) and comparable state statutes may restrict the disposal, treatment, or release of water produced or used during oil and gas development. Subsurface emplacement of fluids, primarily via disposal wells or enhanced oil recovery (“EOR”) wells, is governed by federal or state regulatory authorities that, in some cases, include the state oil and gas regulatory or the state’s environmental authority. The federal Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended the Underground Injection Control provisions of the SDWA to expressly exclude certain hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection,” but disposal of hydraulic fracturing fluids and produced water or their injection for EOR is not excluded. 
Federal agencies have periodically considered additional regulation of hydraulic fracturing. The EPA has published guidance for issuing underground injection permits that would regulate hydraulic fracturing using diesel fuel. This guidance eventually could encourage other regulatory authorities to adopt permitting and other restrictions on the use of hydraulic fracturing. As noted above, in June 2016, EPA finalized regulations that address discharges of wastewater pollutants from onshore unconventional extraction facilities to publicly-owned treatment works. Regulated entities are required to come into compliance with these standards by August 29, 2019. The EPA also published a study of the impact of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources in December 2016, which concluded that drinking water resources can be affected by hydraulic fracturing under specific circumstances. The results of this study could result in additional regulations, which could lead to operational burdens similar to those described above. As also noted above, in January 2017, the EPA issued a proposed rule to include natural gas processing facilities in the Toxic Release Inventory (“TRI”) program. The United States Department of the Interior also finalized a new rule regulating hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands, including requirements for disclosure, wellbore integrity, and handling of flowback water; however, on December 29, 2017, the BLM issued a rescission of the hydraulic fracturing rule. This rescission and the rule as promulgated are subject to ongoing litigation. Additionally, in early 2016, the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) proposed rules related to further controlling the venting and flaring of natural gas on BLM land. On September 28, 2018, the BLM published a final rule that revises the 2016 rules. The new rule, among other things, rescinds the 2016 rule requirements related to waste-minimization plans, gas-capture percentages, well drilling, well completion and related operations, pneumatic controllers, pneumatic diaphragm pumps, storage vessels, and leak detection and repair. The new rule also revised provisions related to venting and flaring. Environmental groups and the states of California and New Mexico have filed challenges to the 2018 rule in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. 
Apart from these ongoing federal and state initiatives, some local governments have adopted their own new requirements on hydraulic fracturing and other oil and gas operations. Voters in Colorado have proposed or advanced initiatives restricting or banning oil and gas development in Colorado, but these initiatives have failed to date. Legislation has also been introduced in Colorado to increase local control regarding oil and gas development. Although this legislation was not adopted, similar legislation could be enacted in the future. Any successful bans or moratoriums where we operate could increase the costs of our operations, impact our profitability, and even prevent us from drilling in certain locations. In addition, in light of concerns about seismic activity being triggered by the injection of produced waters into underground wells, certain regulators are also considering additional requirements related to seismic safety for hydraulic fracturing activities. A 2015 U.S. Geological Survey report identified eight states with areas of increased rates of induced seismicity that could be attributed to fluid injection or oil and gas extraction. Any regulation that restricts our ability to dispose of produced waters or increases the cost of doing business could cause have a material adverse effect on our business.
30

At this time, it is not possible to estimate the potential impact on our business of recent state and local actions or the enactment of additional federal or state legislation or regulations affecting hydraulic fracturing. The adoption of future federal, state, or local laws or implementing regulations imposing new environmental obligations on, or otherwise limiting, our operations could make it more difficult and more expensive to complete oil and natural gas wells, increase our costs of compliance and doing business, delay or prevent the development of certain resources (including especially shale formations that are not commercial without the use of hydraulic fracturing), or alter the demand for and consumption of our products. We cannot assure you that any such outcome would not be material, and any such outcome could have a material and adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations.
Our use of hydraulic fracturing. We use hydraulic fracturing as a means to maximize production of oil and gas from formations having low permeability such that natural flow is restricted. Fracture stimulation has been used for decades in the Rocky Mountain region.
Typical hydraulic fracturing treatments are made up of water, chemical additives, and sand. We utilize major hydraulic fracturing service companies who track and report additive chemicals that are used in fracturing as required by the appropriate government agencies, including FracFocus, the national hydraulic fracturing chemical registry managed by the Ground Water Protection Council and Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission. Each of the service companies we use fracture stimulate a multitude of wells for the industry each year.
We periodically review our plans and policies regarding oil and gas operations, including hydraulic fracturing, in order to minimize any potential environmental impact. Our operations are subject to close supervision by state and federal regulators (including the BLM with respect to federal acreage), who frequently inspect our fracturing operations.
Other State Laws
Our properties located in Colorado are subject to the authority of the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (the “COGCC”), as well as other state agencies. On August 22, 2017, Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper announced seven policy initiatives developed during the Colorado’s review of oil and gas operations. One rulemaking initiative resulting from Colorado’s review was a strengthening of COGCC’s flowline regulations and requirements. COGCC finalized the new flowline rules on February 19, 2018. The new rule includes: increased registration requirements, flowline design requirements, integrity management requirements, and leak detection programs, and requirements for abandoned flowlines. Over the past several years, the COGCC has also approved new rules regarding various other matters, including wellbore integrity, hydraulic fracturing, well control, waste management, spill reporting, spacing of wells and pooling of mineral interests, and an increase in potential sanctions for COGCC rule violations. Additionally, the COGCC approved rules regarding minimum setbacks, groundwater monitoring, large-scale facilities in urban mitigation areas, and public notice requirements that are intended to prevent or mitigate environmental impacts of oil and gas development and include the permitting of wells. Depending on how these and any other new rules are applied, they could add substantial increases in well costs for our Colorado operations. The rules could also impact our ability to operate and extend the time necessary to obtain drilling permits, which would create substantial uncertainty about our ability to meet future drilling plans and thus production and capital expenditure targets. The state of Colorado also created a task force to make recommendations for minimizing land use and other conflicts concerning the location of new oil and gas facilities. In early 2016, COGCC finalized a rulemaking to implement rules applicable to the permitting of large-scale oil and gas facilities in urban mitigation areas and rules requiring operators to register with and provide operational information, including advance notice for certain operations, to municipalities prior to conducting oil and gas operations.
In 2016, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled that the cities of Fort Collins and Longmont do not have authority to ban oil and gas operations within their jurisdictional limits. Although we do not own or lease minerals or operate within any of these municipal areas, the Colorado Supreme Court decision has bearing on our ability to continue to operate in Colorado. Further, Weld County completed implementation of a revised local government permitting process for land use approval, and Boulder County substantially revised its oil and gas regulations. We do not expect that these local government regulations will have any material impact on our operations.
Hazardous substances and waste handling
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include current and prior owners or operators of the site where the release occurred and entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these potentially “responsible persons” may be subject to strict, joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released 
31

into the environment, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies, and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. We are able to control directly the operation of only those wells with respect to which we act as operator. Notwithstanding our lack of direct control over wells operated by others, the failure of an operator other than us to comply with applicable environmental regulations may, in certain circumstances, be attributed to us. We generate materials in the course of our operations that may be regulated as or contain CERCLA hazardous substances but we are not aware of any liabilities for which we may be held responsible that would materially or adversely affect us. 
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal, and cleanup of hazardous wastes, and distinguishes between hazardous and non-hazardous or solid wastes. With the approval of the EPA, the individual states can administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, and some states have adopted their own, more stringent hazardous waste requirements, while all states regulate solid waste. Drilling fluids, produced waters and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development, and production of natural gas and oil are currently regulated under RCRA’s non-hazardous waste provisions and state solid waste laws. However, legislation has been proposed from time to time and various environmental groups have filed lawsuits that, if successful, could result in the reclassification of certain natural gas and oil exploration and production wastes as “hazardous wastes,” which would make such wastes subject to much more stringent handling, disposal, and clean-up requirements. For example, in May 2016, several environmental groups filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that seeks to compel the EPA to review and, if necessary, revise its regulations regarding existing exemptions for exploration and production related wastes. On December 28, 2016, the EPA entered into a consent decree with those environmental groups to settle the lawsuit, which requires the EPA by March 15, 2019 to either propose new regulations regarding exploration and production related wastes or sign a determination that revision of such regulations is not necessary. If the EPA proposes new rulemaking, the 2016 consent decree requires the EPA to take final action on such rules no later than July 15, 2021.
We currently own or lease, and have in the past owned or leased, properties that have been used for numerous years to explore for and produce oil and natural gas. Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, exploration and production fluids and gases may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under the other locations where these hydrocarbons and wastes have been taken for treatment or disposal. In addition, certain of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons and wastes were not under our control. These properties and wastes disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA, and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including groundwater contaminated by prior owners or operators), to pay for damages for the loss or impairment of natural resources, and to take measures to prevent future contamination from our operations.
In addition, other laws require the reporting on use of hazardous and toxic chemicals. For example, in October 2015, EPA granted, in part, a petition filed by several national environmental advocacy groups to add the oil and gas extraction industry to the list of industries required to report releases of certain “toxic chemicals” under the Toxic Release Inventory (“TRI”) program under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act. EPA determined that natural gas processing facilities may be appropriate for addition to TRI applicable facilities and in January 2017, EPA issued a proposed rule to include natural gas processing facilities in the TRI program. EPA review of comments on this proposed rule is ongoing.
Pipeline safety and maintenance
Pipelines, gathering systems, and terminal operations are subject to increasingly strict safety laws and regulations. Both the transportation and storage of refined products and crude oil involve a risk that hazardous liquids may be released into the environment, potentially causing harm to the public or the environment. In turn, such incidents may result in substantial expenditures for response actions, significant penalties, liability for natural resources damages, and significant business interruption. The U.S. Department of Transportation has adopted safety regulations with respect to the design, construction, operation, maintenance, inspection, and management of our pipeline and storage facilities. These regulations contain requirements for the development and implementation of pipeline integrity management programs, which include the inspection and testing of pipelines and the correction of anomalies. These regulations also require that pipeline operation and maintenance personnel meet certain qualifications and that pipeline operators develop comprehensive spill response plans.
There have been recent initiatives to strengthen and expand pipeline safety regulations and to increase penalties for violations. The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act was signed into law in early 2012. In addition, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) has issued new rules to strengthen federal pipeline safety enforcement programs. In 2015, PHMSA proposed to expand its regulations in a number of ways, including through the 
32

increased regulation of gathering lines, even in rural areas. In 2016, PHMSA increased its regulations to require crude oil sampling and reporting as an “offeror” (as defined under the PHMSA) and increased its civil penalty structure.
Climate change
Based on EPA findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA adopted regulations under the CAA that, among other things, established Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”), construction, and Title V operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that are already major sources of emissions of regulated pollutants. In a subsequent ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a portion of EPA’s GHG stationary source program, but also invalidated a portion of it, holding that stationary sources already subject to the PSD or Title V program for non-GHG criteria pollutants remained subject to GHG BACT requirements, but that sources subject to the PSD or Title V program only for GHGs could not be forced to comply with EPA’s GHG BACT requirements. Upon remand, the D.C. Circuit issued an amended judgment, which, among other things, vacated the PSD and Title V regulations under review in that case to the extent they require a stationary source to obtain a PSD or Title V permit solely because the source emits or has the potential to emit GHGs above the applicable major source thresholds. In October 2016, EPA issued a proposed rule to further revise its PSD and Title V regulations applicable to GHGs in accordance with these court rulings, including a proposed de minimis level of GHG emissions below which BACT is not required. This rulemaking process is ongoing. Depending on an EPA’s final rule, it is possible that any regulatory or permitting obligation that limits emissions of GHGs could extend to smaller stationary sources and require us to incur costs to reduce and monitor emissions of GHGs associated with our operations, and may also adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce.
In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHGs from specified onshore and offshore oil and gas production sources in the United States on an annual basis, which include certain of our operations. We are monitoring GHG emissions from our operations in accordance with the GHG emissions reporting rule.
In August of 2015, the EPA finalized rules to further reduce GHG emissions, primarily from coal-fired power plants, under its Clean Power Plan (“CPP”). On March 28, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing the EPA to review the CPP regulations. Following the Executive Order, on April 4, 2017, the EPA announced that it was formally reviewing the CPP. On October 9, 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule to repeal the Clean Power Plan. The comment period on the proposed rule closed on April 26, 2018. On August 21, 2018, EPA proposed the Affordable Clean Energy (“ACE”) rule, which would establish emission guidelines for states to develop plans to address greenhouse gas emissions from existing coal-fired power plants. The ACE would replace the CPP, and the rulemaking process is ongoing.
Congress has, from time to time, considered but not yet passed legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs. In addition, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of GHG emissions, such as electric power plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. 
Additional GHG regulation may also result from the December 2015 agreement that the United States reached during the December 2015 United Nations climate change conference in Paris, France (the “Paris Agreement”). Within the Paris Agreement, the United States agreed to reduce its GHG emissions by 26-28% by the year 2025 as compared with 2005 levels, and provide periodic updates on its progress. On June 1, 2017, President Trump announced that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Agreement. Although President Trump has the authority to unilaterally withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement, it is not clear at this time what steps the Trump Administration plans to take to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, whether a new agreement can be negotiated, or what terms would be included in such an agreement.
Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting, emissions of GHGs from our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations. Severe limitations on GHG emissions could adversely affect our production operations and/or demand for the oil and natural gas we produce. Moreover, incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources as a means of addressing climate change could also reduce demand for the oil and natural gas we produce. In addition, parties concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at sources of funding for energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds, and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities.
Water discharges
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act or the Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into certain surface waters of the U.S., including spills and leaks 
33

of hydrocarbons and produced water. Pursuant to these laws and regulations, we may be required to obtain and maintain approvals or permits for the discharge of wastewater or storm water and are required to develop and implement spill prevention, control, and countermeasure plans, also referred to as “SPCC plans,” in connection with on-site storage of significant quantities of oil. As properties are acquired, we determine the need for new or updated SPCC plans and, where necessary, will develop or update such plans to implement physical and operation controls, the costs of which are not expected to be material. In June 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers adopted a new regulatory definition of “waters of the U.S.” (“WOTUS”), which governs which waters and wetlands are subject to the CWA. In February 2018, the EPA issued a rule that delays the applicability of the new definition of the waters of the United States until 2020. On August 16, 2018, the U.S. District Court for South Carolina found that the EPA and the Corps failed to comply with the Administrative Procedure Act and struck the 2018 rule that attempted to delay the applicability date of the 2015 rule. Other district courts, however, have issued rulings temporarily enjoining the applicability of the 2015 rule itself. On December 11, 2018, the EPA and the Corps issued a proposed new rule that would differently revise the definition of “waters of the United States” and essentially replace both the 1986 rule and the 2015 rule. According to the agencies, the proposed new rule is “intended to increase CWA program predictability and consistency by increasing clarity as to the scope of ‘waters of the United States’ federally regulated under the Act.” If finalized, this new definition of “waters of the United States” will likely be challenged and sought to be enjoined in federal court. Until that time, regulations are being implemented as they were prior to August 2015. Additionally, in June 2016, the EPA finalized new CWA pretreatment standards that would prevent onshore unconventional oil and natural gas wells from discharging wastewater pollutants to publicly-owned treatment facilities. Regulated entities are required to come into compliance with these pretreatment standards by August 29, 2019.
Endangered Species Act
The federal Endangered Species Act restricts activities that may affect endangered and threatened species or their habitats. A final rule amending how critical habitat and suitable habitat areas are designated was finalized by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2016. Some of our facilities may be located in areas that are designated as habitat for endangered or threatened species. The designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected areas.
Employee health and safety
We are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”), and comparable state statutes, the purpose of which are to protect the health and safety of workers. In 2016, there were substantial revisions to the regulations under OSHA that may impact our operations. These changes include among other items: record keeping and reporting, revised crystalline silica standard (which requires the oil and gas industry to implement engineering controls and work practices to limit exposures below the new limits by June 23, 2021), naming oil and gas as a high hazard industry, and requirements for a safety and health management system. In addition, OSHA’s hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes, requires that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations, and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities, and citizens.
National Environmental Policy Act
Natural gas and oil exploration and production activities on federal lands are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”). NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Departments of Interior and Agriculture, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency prepares an Environmental Assessment to evaluate the potential direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts of a proposed project. If impacts are considered significant, the agency will prepare a more detailed environmental impact study that is made available for public review and comment. All of our current exploration and production activities, as well as proposed exploration and development plans, on federal lands require governmental permits that are subject to the requirements of NEPA. The vast majority of our exploration and production activities are not on federal lands. This environmental impact assessment process has the potential to delay or limit, or increase the cost of, the development of natural gas and oil projects on federal lands. Authorizations under NEPA also are subject to protest, appeal, or litigation, which can delay or halt projects.
Oil Pollution Act
The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) establishes strict liability for owners and operators of facilities that are the site of a release of oil into waters of the U.S. The OPA and its associated regulations impose a variety of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills. A “responsible party” under the OPA includes owners and operators of certain onshore facilities from which a release may affect waters of the 
34

U.S. The OPA assigns liability to each responsible party for oil cleanup costs and a variety of public and private damages. While liability limits apply in some circumstances, a party cannot take advantage of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct or resulted from violation of a federal safety, construction, or operating regulation. If the party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in the cleanup, liability limits likewise do not apply. Few defenses exist to the liability imposed by the OPA. The OPA imposes ongoing requirements on a responsible party, including the preparation of oil spill response plans and proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill.
