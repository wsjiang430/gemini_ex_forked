 Item 1.    Business
 As used throughout this Annual Report on Form 10‑K, the terms “St. Joe,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us” include The St. Joe Company and its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise. General
 St. Joe was incorporated in the State of Florida in 1936. We are a Florida real estate development, asset management and operating company with real estate assets and operations currently concentrated in Northwest Florida, which we predominantly use, or intend to use, for or in connection with, our various residential real estate developments, hospitality operations, commercial developments and leasing operations and our forestry operations.
 We have significant residential and commercial land-use entitlements in hand or in process. We seek higher and better uses for our real estate assets through a range of activities from strategic land planning and development, infrastructure improvements and promoting economic development in Northwest Florida. We may explore the sale of such assets opportunistically or when we believe that we or others can better deploy those resources.
 As a real estate development company, we seek to enhance the value of our real estate assets by undertaking targeted types of residential and commercial real estate development opportunities. These targeted opportunities are intended to meet market demand where historically we sold land for other developers to meet that market demand. As an operating company, we operate some of the finest hospitality assets that Northwest Florida has to offer. As an asset management company, we actively manage leasing operations and forestry operations to capture and enhance the value of our real estate assets. Approximately 90% of our real estate land holdings are located within fifteen miles of the Gulf of Mexico.
 Market demand in Northwest Florida is growing as the region grows. For example, the U.S. Census reports that Walton County, Florida, which is where our corporate headquarters are located, was the fourth fastest growing county in Florida from 2010 to 2017 by percentage change (out of sixty-seven Florida counties). Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport (ECP), located in Bay County, Florida and surrounded by a large portion of our land holdings, reports it grew in annual passenger traffic from 312,540 in 2009 to 1,056,101 in 2018. 
 We have a large amount of land to meet future market demand as Northwest Florida grows. In 2018, we estimate approximately 79% of our revenue was generated from sales, activities and operations on approximately 2% of our land holdings.
 Business Strategy
 We expect to use our land holdings, our cash and cash equivalents and investments to increase recurring revenue, while creating long-term value for our shareholders. We believe that our present liquidity position and our land holdings can provide us with numerous opportunities to increase recurring revenue and create long-term value for our shareholders by allowing us to focus on our core business activity of real estate development and asset management, including opportunities near the Gulf of Mexico, Gulf Intracoastal Waterway and Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport.
 In 2018, we initiated the planning of several new projects and specifically began the development or construction of the following projects or phases:

o | Pier Park Crossings Apartments Joint Venture (“JV”) (240 units)
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


o | TownePlace Suites Hotel JV (124 rooms)
--+---------------------------------------


o | Breakfast Point Residential (88 homesites)
--+-------------------------------------------


o | Watersound Origins Residential (359 homesites)

o | WaterSound Beach Club Expansion
--+--------------------------------


o | Panama City Beach Gulf-Front Vacation Rental Homes (two homes)
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


o | WindMark Beach Residential (94 homesites)
--+------------------------------------------

  In addition to the projects above, in 2018, we began planning or designing other projects that are expected to move into construction or development in 2019 and beyond. Some of the projects described above are currently expected to be developed through potential JVs with third parties, subject to negotiation of definitive agreements. While the Company expects to commence development and construction of a number of projects beginning in 2019, timing of some projects may be delayed due to factors beyond the Company’s control.
 During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we repurchased 5,238,566 and 8,450,294 shares, respectively, of our common stock. In addition, subsequent to December 31, 2018 and through February 25, 2019, we repurchased an additional 471,500 shares of our common stock. Subsequent to these repurchases, we have a total of $35.8 million available for the repurchase of shares pursuant to our Stock Repurchase Program. See Item 5. Market for the Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities and Note 16. Stockholders’ Equity included in Item 15 of this Form 10-K. 
 Our 2019 strategic plan includes making investments that we believe will contribute towards increasing our future growth, particularly in real estate projects that we expect will provide recurring revenue. Our 2019 capital expenditures budget exceeds our actual 2018 expenditures, as planned projects move into development or construction. We anticipate evaluating opportunities to develop, improve or acquire a broad range of asset types that we believe can generate recurring revenue and provide acceptable rates of return, including but not limited to retail, office, hospitality, industrial, hotels and multi-family properties. We anticipate that these future capital commitments will be funded through new financing arrangements, cash on hand, cash equivalents, short term investments and cash generated from operations as well as through potential JV arrangements. We expect to make these expenditures throughout the coming fiscal year and beyond, but do not anticipate that we will see the full benefit of these investments during 2019. In 2019, we intend to focus on the following initiatives:

· | Expand our portfolio of income producing commercial properties. As of December 31, 2018, we owned a portfolio of approximately 812,630 square feet of rentable commercial space (93% leased). As of December 31, 2017, we owned 813,602 square feet of rentable commercial space (87% leased). As of December 31, 2016, we owned 602,319 square feet (87% leased). We intend to explore other opportunities to increase the size and scope of our existing portfolio in ways that can increase recurring revenue and create accretive value for our land holdings.

  Commencement of development of our potential JV projects is subject to execution of definitive agreements with our potential JV partners. While the Company expects to commence development and construction of a number of commercial projects beginning in 2019, timing of some projects may be delayed due to factors beyond the Company’s control.

· | Residential development. We have residential communities at different stages of planning or development. In 2018, we sold 202 homesites, compared with 174 homesites in 2017 and 106 homesites in 2016. We plan to focus on investing in communities that have the potential for long term, scalable and repeatable revenue. We expect to continue to be a developer of completed residential homesites for sale to builders and retail homesites for sale to consumers in our communities.

 While the Company expects to commence development and construction of a number of residential projects beginning in 2019, timing of some projects may be delayed due to factors beyond the Company’s control.

· | Expand and increase scope of our hospitality segment. We presently own and/or operate a wide range of hospitality assets, including the WaterColor Inn, WaterSound Inn, The Pearl Hotel, Camp Creek Golf Club, Shark’s Tooth Golf Club, WaterSound Beach Club, Fish Out of Water (“FOOW”) restaurant, Havana Beach Bar & Grille, WaterColor Store, our private membership club, (“The Clubs by Joe”) and other related assets, which already generate significant recurring revenue for us. We plan to expand the scope and scale of our hospitality assets and services to enable us to enhance the value and revenue those assets provide. As of December 31, 2018, The Clubs by Joe had 1,112 members, compared with 961 members as of December 31, 2017, and 754 members as of December 31, 2016.

 While the Company expects to commence development and construction of a number of hospitality projects beginning in 2019, timing of some projects may be delayed due to factors beyond the Company’s control.

· | Strategic infrastructure and economic development initiatives. We intend to continue to work collaboratively with public and private partners on strategic infrastructure and economic development initiatives that are expected to help attract quality job creators and diversify the Northwest Florida economy, which we believe can create accretive value for our land holdings. One such initiative is Triumph Gulf Coast, Inc., which is a not-for-profit corporation that is charged with distributing a legal settlement of $1.5 billion as it is paid out over a total of eighteen years within eight counties in Northwest Florida. We have significant land holdings in three of those counties: Bay County, Walton County and Gulf County.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | JVs with best of class operators. We believe that by entering into partnerships, JVs or other collaborations and alliances with best of class developers and operators, we can more efficiently utilize our land assets while reducing our capital requirements. We have announced potential JVs to develop some of the residential, commercial and hospitality projects described above. Completion of these proposed projects is subject to, among other things, execution of definitive agreements with our potential JV partners.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Maintain efficient operations. We expect to continue our cost and investment discipline to ensure low fixed expenses and bottom line performance in all environments.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Maintain liquidity and balance sheet strength. We plan to continue to maintain a high degree of liquidity while seeking opportunities to invest our cash in ways that we believe can increase shareholder value, including our investments-debt securities and investments-equity securities (“Securities”), share repurchases, real estate and other strategic investments.

  Our Business
 We operate our business in four reportable operating segments: (1) residential real estate, (2) hospitality, (3) commercial leasing and sales and (4) forestry. For financial information about our operating segments, please see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as well as Note 21. Segment Information included in Item 15 of this Form 10‑K. Residential Real Estate
 Our residential real estate segment typically plans and develops residential communities across a wide range of price points and sells homesites to builders or to retail consumers. From time to time, our residential real estate segment also evaluates opportunities to sell some of our hospitality properties. Our existing residential communities include: Watersound Origins, Breakfast Point, SouthWood, WindMark Beach, WaterColor, SummerCamp Beach, and RiverCamps. In addition, the WaterSound Beach, WaterSound West Beach and Wild Heron communities are substantially developed, with homesites in these communities available for sale.
 The Latitude Margaritaville Watersound community is a 55+ residential community in Bay County, Florida that is proposed to be developed as a JV, subject to execution of definitive agreements with our potential JV partner. This proposed JV residential project, which is estimated to include approximately 3,000 residential homesites and adjoining new projects like the commercial spaces fronting State Road (“SR”) 79 and a marina village on the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway are still in the planning phase.

 As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 684 residential homesites under contract for gross revenue of approximately $67.9 million at closing of the homesites, which are expected over the next several years. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 211 residential homesites under contract for gross revenue of approximately $7.5 million ($6.1 million of which has been realized through December 31, 2018).  
 Hospitality
 Our hospitality segment features hotel operations, lodging, restaurants, golf courses, beach clubs, marinas and other resort assets. 
 We own and operate the award-winning WaterColor Inn, which includes the FOOW restaurant and the WaterSound Inn. We also own and operate retail and commercial outlets near our hospitality facilities, including the WaterColor Store. The Clubs by Joe provides members and guests in our hotels access to our resort facilities, which include the Camp Creek Golf Club, Shark’s Tooth Golf Club, and the WaterSound Beach Club. The Clubs by Joe is focused on creating a world class membership experience combined with the luxurious aspects of a four star/four diamond resort.
 We operate the award-winning The Pearl Hotel and Havana Beach Bar & Grille restaurant. In addition, we own and operate two marinas in Northwest Florida, Bay Point Marina and Port St. Joe Marina. Subsequent to the landfall of Hurricane Michael on October 10, 2018, the marinas remain closed due to significant damage requiring long-term restoration, which is currently underway. We maintain property and business interruption insurance on the impacted marina assets. See Note 7. Hurricane Michael included in Item 15 of this Form 10-K for additional information. 
 Commercial Leasing and Sales
 Our commercial leasing and sales segment includes leasing retail, office and commercial property, cell towers and other assets as well as planning, development, entitlement, management and sale of our commercial land holdings for a variety of uses. These uses include a broad range of retail, office, hotel, assisted-living, multi-family and industrial properties. From time to time, our commercial leasing and sales segment also evaluates opportunities to sell some of our hospitality properties. We provide development opportunities for national, regional and local retailers and other strategic partners in Northwest Florida. We own and manage retail shopping centers and develop commercial parcels. We have large land holdings near the Pier Park retail center, Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport, the Port of Port St. Joe, along roadways and near or within business districts in the region. Our major existing holdings include the Pier Park North JV with 320,310 square feet of rentable commercial space (96% leased), the manufacturing facilities at VentureCrossings with 243,605 square feet of rentable manufacturing space (100% leased) and the Beckrich Office Park with 67,108 square feet of rentable office space (96% leased). See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K for additional information on the commercial leasing and sales segment.  Forestry
 Our forestry segment focuses on the management of our timber holdings in Northwest Florida and generates revenue primarily from open market sales of timber on site without the associated delivery costs. We grow and sell pulpwood, sawtimber, and other forest products. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 115,000 acres in our forestry segment and expect to have the ability to consistently operate approximately 67,000 of those acres.
 We may sell our timber holdings, undeveloped land or land with limited development and easements. Some parcels include the benefits of limited development activity including improved roads, ponds and fencing. We have traditionally sold parcels of varying sizes ranging from less than one acre to thousands of acres. The pricing of these parcels varies significantly based on size, location, terrain, timber quality and other local factors. We also lease land within the forestry segment for hunting and other uses.

 Seasonality
 Our business may be affected by seasonal fluctuations. For example, revenue from our hospitality operations are typically higher in the second and third quarters, but can vary depending on the timing of holidays and school breaks, including spring break.
 In addition to the seasonality effect of our hospitality operations, our residential real estate business is predominantly composed of sales to homebuilders, who tend to buy multiple homesites in sporadic transactions, which impacts the variability in our results of operations. Additionally, the revenue resulting from our residential real estate operations may vary from period to period depending on the communities where homesites are sold, as prices can vary significantly by community. Our commercial real estate projects are likewise subject to one-off sales and the development of specific projects depending on demand. These variables have caused, and may continue to cause, our operating results to vary significantly from period to period.
 Competition
 Real estate development and commercial leasing operations are both highly competitive and fragmented. We compete with local, regional and national real estate companies, some of which may have greater financial, marketing, sales and other resources than we do.
 A number of highly competitive companies participate in the hospitality business. Our ability to remain competitive and to attract customers and retain memberships depends on our success in distinguishing the quality and value of our products and services from those offered by others. We compete based on location, price and amenities.
 In our forestry business, we compete with numerous public and privately held timber companies in our region. The principal methods of competition are price and delivery.
 Governmental Regulation
 Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations that affect every aspect of our business, including environmental and land use laws relating to, among other things, water, air, solid waste, hazardous substances, zoning, construction permits or entitlements, building codes and the requirements of the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state statutes relating to the health and safety of our employees. Although we believe that we are in material compliance with these requirements, there can be no assurance that we will not incur significant costs, civil and criminal penalties, and liabilities, including those relating to claims for damages to property or natural resources, resulting from our operations. We maintain environmental and safety compliance programs for our facilities and timberlands to monitor compliance with these laws and regulations. Enactment of new laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations or the interpretation and enforcement of these laws or regulations, might require significant expenditures. Employees
 As of February 25, 2019, we had 53 full-time employees. Most persons employed in the day-to-day operations of our hospitality segment are employed by a third party management company engaged pursuant to a consulting and employment services agreement. In addition, we utilize part-time employees and independent contractors during the year based on seasonal needs. Available Information
