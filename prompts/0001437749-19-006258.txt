ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
BIO-key International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company,” “BIO-key,” “we,” or “us), was founded in 1993 to develop and market advanced fingerprint biometric technology and related security software solutions. First incorporated as BBG Engineering, the company was renamed SAC Technologies in 1994 and renamed BIO-key International, Inc. in 2002.
 
We develop and market advanced fingerprint biometric identification and identity verification technologies, as well as related identity management and credentialing hardware and software solutions. We were pioneers in developing automated, finger identification technology that supplements or compliments other methods of identification and verification, such as personal inspection identification, passwords, tokens, smart cards, ID cards, PKI, credit card, passports, driver’s licenses, OTP or other form of possession or knowledge-based credentialing. Additionally, advanced BIO-key® technology has been, and is, used to improve both the accuracy and speed of competing finger-based biometrics.
 
We have developed what we believe is the most discriminating and effective commercially available finger-based biometric technology. Our primary focus is in marketing and selling this technology into commercial logical and physical privilege entitlement and access control markets. Our primary market focus includes enterprise security, mobile payments and credentialing, healthcare records and data security, among other things. Our secondary focus includes government markets, large scale identity projects such as voter’s registration, driver’s license, national ID programs, and SIM card registration.
 
In 2015, we entered into the fingerprint hardware device business through a strategic relationship with China Goldjoy Group (“CGG”), an entity that is affiliated with one of our directors. We market and sell through distributors and directly to end users via Amazon, our SideSwipe™, EcoID™ and SideTouch™ finger readers which can be used on any laptop, tablet or other device which contains a USB port. We also market and sell a variety of biometric and Bluetooth enabled padlocks, luggage locks, and bicycle locks.
 
We continue to develop advancements in our capabilities, as well as explore potential strategic relationships, including business combinations and acquisitions, which could help us leverage our capability to deliver our solutions. We have built a direct sales force, and also utilize distributors, resellers, integrators and partners with substantial experience in selling technology solutions to government and corporate customers in their respective markets.
 
Overview
 
We are a leader in finger-based biometric identification and personal identity verification, as well as authentication-transaction security. Stand-alone, or in partnerships with OEMs, integrators, and solution providers, we provide biometric security solutions to private and public sector customers. We help customers reduce risk by providing the ability to control access to facilities and services, in either logical or physical domains. Our solutions positively identify individuals before granting access to corporate resources, subscribed services, cloud services and applications.
 
We also develop and distribute hardware components that are used in conjunction with our software, and sell third-party hardware components with our software in various configurations required by our customers. Our products are interoperable with all major fingerprint reader and hardware manufacturers, enabling application developers, value added resellers (“VARs”), and channel partners to integrate our fingerprint biometrics into their applications, while dramatically reducing maintenance, upgrade and life-cycle costs. Our core technology supports interoperability on over 40 different commercially available fingerprint readers and is interoperable across Windows, Linux, and the Android mobile operating systems. This interoperability is unique in the industry, is a key differentiator for our products in the biometric market and, in our opinion, makes our technology more viable than competing technologies and expands the size of the overall market for our products.
 
In November 2015, we entered into a license agreement with CGG pursuant to which we obtained a license to certain software from CGG, known as FingerQ, which has been integrated into our core WEB-key® platform and can be used in a number of application areas, including mobile payments and personal identity devices for the Asia Pacific markets. In 2016, the software has been integrated into our line of finger scanners that are marketed to consumers and enterprise users worldwide.
 
During 2016, we continued to develop and expand our consumer footprint for hardware products such as SideSwipe, SideTouch and EcoID by launching on Amazon, making the products available through Microsoft retail stores and developing and promoting our own eCommerce website. SideTouch was featured on HSN in December of 2016.

Finger-based Biometric Identification and Personal Identity Verification
 
Our biometric identification technology improves both the accuracy and speed of authenticating or identifying individuals, by extracting unique landmarks and other characteristics from a fingerprint and comparing it to the landmarks from previously enrolled fingerprints to determine a match. The technology is built to be scalable and to handle databases containing millions of fingerprints. We achieve the highest levels of discrimination without requiring any other identifying data (multi-factor) such as a user ID, smart ID cards, or tokens, although our technology can be used in conjunction with such additional factors. Users of our technology have the option of on device or cloud authentication. This flexible authentication option in conjunction with our interoperable capabilities, is another key differentiator of our biometric identification solutions.
 
We support industry standards, such as SAML, FIDO, BioAPI, and have received National Institute of Standards and Technology independent laboratory certification of our ability to support Homeland Security Presidential Directive #12 (HSPD-12) and ANSI/INCITS-378 templates, as well as validation of our fingerprint match speed and accuracy in large database environments.

Identity Management, User Authentication, Privilege Entitlement and Access Control
 
Our products simplify the authentication process for enterprise users and consumers, while raising security to the highest levels of assurance. This allows our customers to meet new, stronger authentication requirements and security best practices across many industries, while delivering a superior end-user experience. Customers use our products to reduce risk of theft, fraud, loss, account takeover attacks, and unauthorized account sharing by limiting access to valuable assets, privileges, data, services, networks and places to only authorized individuals. Our products provide stronger identity binding and a superior user experience versus traditional credentialing systems, which utilize a physical or knowledge-based electronic credential to authenticate the holder, but fail to authenticate the actual user in addition to the token. Nearly every enterprise and public sector has seen a shift in the requirement for stronger authentication, and both NIST and industry thought leaders such as Microsoft have encouraged entities to enhance their security posture by implementing stronger 2-factor (2FA) or multi-factor authentication (MFA). Our products help organizations to meet their strong authentication goals, with a sign in process that end users prefer. In our opinion, the market for advanced user authentication, including fingerprint biometrics, extends to nearly every industry segment. We believe the market opportunity for our products is massive, global and growing. 
 
Historically, our largest market has been access control within highly regulated industries like government and healthcare. However, we are witnessing a change in the landscape as organizations within all industries and of all sizes are embracing biometric technology as a security and workflow solution. Championed by the millions of users that have been successfully introduced to biometrics by companies such as Apple and Samsung, today’s users have witnessed the security and convenience benefits of biometric technology.
 
Upon introducing a series of compact fingerprint readers, we saw an immediate increase in inquiries from both large commercial companies seeking an alternative to passwords, and from consumers recognizing that they could use SideSwipe or EcoID to replace their Windows password.

There are gaps in the existing IAM solution space that provide the opportunity for us to demonstrate the unique business value of our solutions. One of those gaps is the challenge of authenticating users that “rove” among workstations. A second gap is preventing unauthorized account sharing. These gaps represent soft entry points to gain market share by highlighting known shortcomings of the status quo IAM approach. 
----------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


OEM Customers | We will continue to prioritize securing agreements with OEM customers. The history of success supporting NCR, McKesson and LexisNexis provides an established footprint that we intend to build upon. As OEM customers embed our solutions within their products, the customer benefits from the enhanced security and workflow. OEM customers ordering patterns are more predictable and OEM customers generally require lower service and support resourcing. In 2018, we added our first TouchLock OEM customer by signing an agreement with Aluratek.
--------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Highly Regulated Industries | Government projects and healthcare, including hospitals, clinics, private practices and blood centers provide a significant opportunity for us. In healthcare, we anticipate that patient identification will emerge as a highly regulated requirement for all healthcare organizations and we are developing our software to accommodate this need. The financial services industry in the U.S. has been slow to adopt biometric authentication while Asia and Europe have been more receptive to incorporating biometrics. We anticipate that the U.S. market will grow rapidly once the first major institution adopts a biometric solution.
-----------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Partner Model | We remain committed to a partner sales model. In the Identity and Access Management or “IAM” space, we have adjusted our targets to include working with resellers, and are developing a security assertion markup language (SAML) solution for ease of installation purposes. In healthcare, HealthCast and other partners, such as Allscripts, identified and sold our solutions to a number of new customers in 2019.

In order to maintain our position in the market, we will continue to upgrade and refine our existing technologies as new standards become relevant to our customers and markets.
 
We have also licensed mobile platform software from CGG which we have integrated with our core WEB-key offerings and introduced to the Asian markets in 2016. This presents a significant opportunity for us going forward. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we spent $1,415,401 and $1,659,875, respectively, on research and development.
 
Products on Demand (PoD)
 
Our technology and development team has the expertise to develop customer specific solutions if they are funded. Our strategy to support POD is to utilize internal resources, outsource support services and strategic partners to satisfy unique customer requirements. Our flexible, nimble business model and interoperable capabilities are key differentiators.
 
Competition 
 
In addition to companies that provide existing commonplace methods of restricting access to facilities and logical access points such as pass cards, PIN numbers, passwords, locks and keys, there are numerous companies involved in the development, manufacturing and marketing of fingerprint biometrics products to commercial, government, law enforcement and prison markets. These companies include, but are not limited to, 3M (Cogent), NEC, and MorphoTrak.
 
The majority of sales for automated fingerprint identification products in the market to date have been deployed for government agencies, healthcare facilities, and law enforcement applications. The consumer and commercial markets represent areas of significant growth potential for biometrics, led by the use of mobile devices.
 
The epidemic of security and data breaches reported over the past few years is one of the driving factors for identifying new methods of protecting valuable data. After attempting to create a more sophisticated password or more efficient token or PIN, it has become apparent that each of these methods are easily compromised, and the downside risks are significant.
 
With respect to competing biometrics technologies, each has its strengths and weaknesses and none has emerged as a market leader:
 

● | Fingerprint identification is generally viewed as very accurate, inexpensive and non-intrusive and is the dominant biometric in use today and will be for the foreseeable future;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
