Item 1. Business
Corporate History and Background
Katapult Holdings, Inc., formerly known as FinServ Acquisition Corp. (“FinServ”), was incorporated in the state of Delaware in August 2019 for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. On December 18, 2020, FinServ entered into that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated December 18, 2020 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among FinServ, Keys Merger Sub 1, Inc. (“Merger Sub 1”), a wholly owned subsidiary of FinServ, Katapult Intermediate Holdings LLC (formerly known as Keys Merger Sub 2, LLC) (“Merger Sub 2”), a wholly owned subsidiary of FinServ, the entity formerly known as Katapult Holdings. Inc. (formerly known as Cognical Holdings, Inc.), a Delaware corporation (“Legacy Katapult”), and Orlando Zayas, in his capacity as the representative of all pre-closing stockholders. On June 9, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), the transactions contemplated pursuant to the Merger Agreement were consummated through the merger of Merger Sub 1 with and into Legacy Katapult, with Legacy Katapult surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of FinServ (the “First Merger”), followed immediately by the merger of the resulting company with and into Merger Sub 2, with Merger Sub 2 surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of FinServ (the “Second Merger” and collectively with the First Merger, and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the “Merger”). On the Closing Date, and in connection with the closing of the Merger, FinServ changed its name to Katapult Holdings, Inc. and Merger Sub 2 changed its name to Katapult Immediate Holdings LLC.
The Merger and related transactions were accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in United States of America (“GAAP”). Under this method of accounting, FinServ was treated as the “acquired” company for financial reporting purposes with Legacy Katapult determined to be the accounting acquirer. This determination was primarily based on Legacy Katapult’s stockholders prior to the Merger having had a majority of the voting rights in the combined company, Legacy Katapult’s operations represented the ongoing operations of the combined company, Legacy Katapult and its former owners had the right to appoint a majority of the directors in the combined company, and Legacy Katapult's senior management represented the senior management of the combined company. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Merger was treated as the equivalent of Legacy Katapult issuing stock for the net assets of FinServ, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of FinServ are stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. See Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the Merger and related transactions.
Our wholly owned subsidiaries are Katapult Intermediate Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company formed in December 2020, Katapult Group, Inc. (formerly known as Cognical, Inc.), a Delaware corporation incorporated in March 2012, and Katapult SPV-1 LLC, a Delaware limited liability company formed in March 2019. Legacy Katapult was incorporated in the state of Delaware in 2016. Since April 2019, Katapult SPV-1 LLC has originated all of our lease agreements with customers and owns all of the leased property. 
Unless otherwise noted, “we”, “us”, “our”, “Katapult”, and the “Company” and similar terms refer to Legacy Katapult and its subsidiaries prior to the consummation of the Merger, and Katapult Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries after the Merger.

Company Overview
We are a technology driven lease-to-own platform that integrates with omni-channel retailers and e-commerce platforms to power the purchase of everyday durable goods for underserved U.S. non-prime consumers. Through point-of-sale ("POS") integration and innovative, mobile app featuring our virtual card technology, Katapult Pay, consumers who may be unable to access traditional financing can shop a growing network of merchants with our platform.We believe our merchants benefit from higher retail conversion and greater marketing spend efficiency by reaching this underserved segment.
The platform is designed to provide consumers a frustration-free checkout experience that is simple, easy and transparent. Consumers complete a three-step application and our fully automated approval process generates a decision in approximately five seconds or less on average. We empower customers by providing flexibility in their lease-to-own arrangement. Customers can make payments on a weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly or monthly basis, and we offer transparent payment options, including allowing customers to make payments for their full renewal term, exercise an early purchase option (buyout), or return items if they have life cycle events or decide their needs change. In addition, we do not charge late fees.
Our solution is designed to enable merchants to efficiently promote and move inventory by allowing merchants to reach a previously inaccessible customer with the goal of driving incremental sales and lowering customer acquisition cost. Our mobile app featuring Katapult Pay  also provides an accelerated option for merchants to add our solution with minimal tech lift and a lower cost. 
We have platform integrations with leading e-commerce platforms and prime lenders. Through e-commerce platform integrations with Shopify, BigCommerce, Magento, and WooCommerce, among others, we can complete direct integrations with merchants with ease. Our prime lender integrations lead to higher approval rates for merchants who have included us as a payment option, ensuring that consumers have options at the checkout and merchants make the most of every consumer site visit.
Technology is at the core of everything we do from simplifying the customer experience to driving repeat transactions. Our proprietary risk models have been built on alternative data sets, including data from over 1.2 million lease-to-own transactions and over seven plus years of repayments. Furthermore, the platform’s risk management models are built to utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning ("AI/ML") to incorporate additional data from new lease-purchase transactions.
From inception through December 31, 2022, we have approved approximately 2.3 million customers. We had a net promoter score (NPS) of 56 as of December 31, 2022. NPS is a score that measures the likelihood of users to recommend a company’s products or services to others, and ranges from a low of negative 100 to high of positive 100, and benchmark scores can vary significantly by industry. A score greater than zero represents a company having more promoters than detractors.
Industry Background
Our lease-purchase platform offers consumers an alternative to traditional financing of home furnishings, automotive goods, electronics, computers, and other durable goods. Non-prime consumers typically do not have sufficient cash or credit to obtain these goods.
Lease-to-Own Transaction
A lease-to-own (“LTO”) transaction is a flexible alternative for consumers to obtain and enjoy brand name merchandise with no long-term obligation. Key features of our lease-to-own transactions include:
• Access to e-commerce retailers. We are a transaction option at checkout for well-known e-commerce merchants such as Wayfair, Sears, Lenovo, Nectar, and Purple.
• Convenient payment options. Customers make payments on a weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly or monthly basis. Payments can be automatically charged to the customer’s authorized credit card, checking account, debit card or the customer can make payments directly via our mobile app. Additionally, customers may make additional payments and exercise cost-saving early payment options.
• No long-term commitment. Customers have the flexibility of no long-term commitment and may return the item under the terms of the lease agreement if he or she does not exercise a purchase option or renew the lease.
Virtual Lease-to-Own Market
According to management estimates, the total addressable market for the virtual lease-to-own market is estimated to be approximately $40 - $50 billion. Based on our 2022 gross originations, we believe that we currently capture less than 1% market share in this market.
Our Solution
We believe we are transforming the way non-prime consumers can purchase durable goods by providing a seamless, easy, and transparent application and checkout experience.
Consumer Features
• Lease-to-own of durable goods. We empower consumers with access to a path to ownership for new and used durable goods and accessories to support such goods with a leasable amount ranging from $100 to $3,500.
• Simple process and efficient approval. Through an easy 3-step application process requiring basic information inputs and no hard credit check, consumers receive fully-automated approval on average in approximately five seconds.
• Flexible repayment options. Customers can elect to lease an item for the full term, pay off the lease early, or return the item at any time during the term of the lease. To lower the total cost of the lease, during the first 90 days of the lease, customers have an option to purchase the item for a total cost-to-own of the cash price and applicable taxes of the item plus a 5% fee in certain states. A $45 fee is also charged in certain states. After 90 days, an early purchase option is available at any time which permits customers to purchase the item for meaningfully less than the full-term cost-to-own as described below. Our customers have the flexibility of no long-term commitment and may return the item under the terms of the lease agreement if they do not exercise a purchase option or renew the lease. The payment term for the lease ranges from 10, 12 or 18 months. Payment frequency can be weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly or monthly based on a customer's pay frequency.
• Mobile App. In 2022, we launched our mobile app which enables our customers to shop, make payments and complete new lease transactions with a variety of merchants via an iOS or Android mobile device.
• Katapult Pay. In connection with our mobile app launch we introduced a new feature, Katapult Pay our one-time use virtual card technology that makes lease purchasing simple and intuitive for our customers. Using the Katapult Pay feature on our mobile app, our customers can complete a lease transaction and check out with a one-time use virtual card to facilitate the payment. Our mobile app featuring Katapult Pay also offers merchants an accelerated option for adding our lease-to-own solution with minimal tech lift and lower cost, while giving us more control to own the end-to-end customer experience and improve conversion rates.
The total cost a customer may pay in connection with our lease-purchase transaction depends on certain factors, including, but not limited to: (1) total cost limitations, which vary across states and generally range between 2.0 and 2.25 times the cash price, referred to as the Lease Multiple, (2) the maximum length of the lease agreement term (typically 10-18 months), (3) whether the early purchase option (buyout) is exercised, and (4) whether the customer exercises their right to terminate the lease, without penalty if current, thereby ending additional renewal payment obligations. In general, during the first ninety (90) days, our customers have the ability to purchase the good for the cash price of the item plus 5% and any applicable fees (including initial fees, where applicable) and taxes. After ninety (90) days, but prior to reaching the maximum renewal term, the customer may exercise the purchase option at a discount on the remaining lease renewal payments (typically 55–65% of the remaining renewal payments).
Customers may renew through the maximum term at which point they will have paid approximately two times the cash price to own the item. Customers have the option to terminate the lease at any time with no penalty or further obligation (other than the lease cost already incurred). Upon termination, the customer must return the durable good that had been leased, which can be returned to us or the merchant if within the merchant's return period. Lease-purchase transactions, unlike credit or a loan, are not subject to variable interest rates and do not include finance charges. Below is an illustrative timeline depicting the total cost a customer would pay at certain points during the life of the transaction:
Merchant Features
• Marketing capabilities. We enable merchants to offer non-prime consumers a lease-purchase option at point of sale, which is coupled with Katapult tools and digital resources to attract, identify and educate consumers on the Katapult option for paying over time.
• Analytics. We provide merchants with insightful analytics that help them understand performance and activity associated with non-prime applications. The platform also offers other key insights into customers’ shopping habits to help merchants optimize customer conversion and customer acquisition costs.
• Client success support. Our client success team partners with merchants to analyze and interpret the insights delivered through the merchant platform. Our team conducts in-depth user experience analyses of merchant online storefronts, providing custom recommendations for the ideal mix and display of our product offerings to present to customers in order to optimize average order values and conversion rates.
• Simple integration and highly customizable solution. Our off-the-shelf, custom integration options are designed to provide seamless flexibility to merchants seeking efficient and effective rollouts of digital POS solutions.
•  Developer documentation. Our developer portal contains extensive developer documentation that makes it easy for developers to integrate via turnkey solutions, custom application programming interfaces (“API”), hosted programs, or other integrations.
We believe that merchants realize the following benefits from our platform:
• More customers. Merchants add incremental customers from the non-prime segment who otherwise might not be shopping on their site.
• Better conversion. Merchants have the potential to increase customer conversion when they offer our platform as it provides customers an alternative financing solution.
• High rate of repeat customers. Our easy-to-use platform has generated a loyal following of repeat customers (defined as customers who have originated more than one lease with Katapult over their lifetime). During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, 47% of our gross originations were completed with repeat customers.
• Ease of integration. Our direct API allows for fast integration with minimal investment with merchants able to easily connect the platform to their existing online shopping cart. Moreover, we provide a dedicated integration team to ensure efficient rollouts.
Merchants
We are party to an agreement with Wayfair Inc., dated November 24, 2020, whereby we provide Wayfair customers with lease-purchase options for certain Wayfair products directly on Wayfair’s customer website (the “Wayfair Agreement”). We originated approximately 57% and 63% of our gross originations for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively through the Wayfair Agreement. The Wayfair Agreement continues for successive two-year terms and may be terminated by either party at any time and for any reason provided that the terminating party provides written notice sixty days prior to the date of termination. The Wayfair Agreement does not prohibit Wayfair from offering lease-to-own options from our competitors. The Wayfair Agreement allows us to benefit from Wayfair’s broad range of product offerings and market ourselves to a larger audience of consumers who may seek alternative payment options.
As of December 31, 2022, we had over 200 total merchants on the platform. Our top ten merchants in the aggregate represented approximately 83% and 90% of our total gross originations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Developer-First Approach to Integration
Our platform is designed to be easy and seamless to integrate regardless of integration method:
• Platform plug-in: Our API is fast and easy to integrate with a number of e-commerce platforms, including Shopify, Magento, WooCommerce and BigCommerce. Integrations with these platforms allow merchants to offer the Katapult lease-purchase as an option at checkout, process our charges in their 
respective order management systems, and gain access to the Katapult's platform-based analytics software while maintaining control over the customer experience.
• Direct API: Our API enables merchants to fully control the placement and experience of our offering, which we believe aids the seamless integration of our lease-purchase option into the merchant’s existing infrastructure.
• Waterfall partnerships: A waterfall is where the application will flow from the prime lender to other financing and lease-purchase options automatically; this gives the consumer the best option for their situation. Our technology supports sophisticated integration with these partners with the goal of ensuring a smooth and efficient customer transaction experience during application and checkout.
Our Technology and Risk Assessment Model
Native E-Commerce Solution
We were born and bred to be an e-commerce solution for consumers and we believe we are the only non-prime consumer POS lease-purchase platform focused on e-commerce. We offer a fully-digital, seamless and differentiated platform driven by proprietary technology and risk models that have been developed over several years. In 2022, we launched our mobile app featuring Katapult Pay, our one-time use virtual card technology which allows our customers to complete a lease-to-own transaction with the merchants on our Katapult Pay feature of our mobile app. Our proprietary technology behind Katapult Pay allows us to differentiate between leasable and non-leasable items in a customer's cart without an integration with that merchant. 
Technology, Engineering Talent and Product Architecture
Our proprietary technology platform is essential to our core operations. We utilize modern, cutting-edge technology including sophisticated behavioral machine learning models and cloud-based computing designed to offer a seamless digital consumer experience on the front end as well as a constantly evolving real-time decision engine on the back end. In order to build these proprietary, innovative and secure products, we place a significant emphasis on identifying and employing talented and driven technology-focused professionals and engineers. 
Data Driven
Our proprietary technology platform combined with data collection, accumulation and analysis provide us with meaningful insights that allow the business to perform better. As additional data from new transactions is continuously incorporated into the risk assessment models, algorithms and business practices, we are able to improve our risk assessment model, algorithms and business practices over time. We believe this allows us to further mitigate repayment and fraud risk. Additionally, we leverage customer preference and activity data to identify opportunities for repeat business, new customer offerings and general performance enhancements.
We use a complex set of proprietary approval and existing customer modeling to achieve low levels of fraud and high payment performance, with the goal of protecting consumers, merchants, and us. The platform checks approximately 100 transaction attributes and up to 2,000 data points in aggregate across the fraud detection and risk models, from a minimum of seven user inputs consumers provide and data acquired from other sources.
Proprietary Risk Assessment Models
Our proprietary, end-to-end technology platform has been designed and built to handle the volume and data from e-commerce transactions. The system is non-FICO based, relying on internally developed scoring and analytics to identify appropriate customers for our lease-purchase offering. Our behavioral learning-based risk models are designed to effectively price risk and provide customized recommendations. The platform considers data beyond traditional credit scores, such as lease history, behavioral biometrics and mobile device information to predict repayment ability, and leverages this with real-time response data.
Lean and Scalable Model
Compared to brick-and-mortar non-prime options, we have been successful in addressing the non-prime consumer through POS solutions on e-commerce merchant websites.
As compared to brick-and-mortar non-prime options, we believe our model focused on the e-commerce POS lease-purchase option is efficient and scalable for the following reasons:
• Over time as transaction volume grows, we are positioned to achieve more operating leverage. Our model is primarily driven by a technology platform that does not require significant increases in operating overhead to support sales growth.
• We have no inventory risk and offer a drop-ship option. We do not have the costs associated with buying, storing and shipping inventory. Instead, goods are shipped directly to consumers.
Our Growth Strategies
We believe we have several strong levers for growth including the opportunity to increase market share of the e-commerce durable goods market. We estimate that we capture less than 1% of the virtual lease-to-own market, based on our 2022 gross originations.
We believe we will significantly benefit from deepening relationships with existing merchants and further partner expansion. New direct merchant POS integrations, as well as product enhancements and new product diversification including the launch of our mobile app featuring Katapult Pay, also present additional areas of potential growth. In addition, data analytics services and direct merchant co-marketing initiatives and dynamic consumer scoring models are other potential avenues to drive growth.
Our multi-pronged growth strategy is designed to create opportunities that drive value for consumers and merchants. Near-term areas of focus include expanding to higher-frequency transactions, expanding customer reach, and expanding merchant reach.
Significant levers for continued organic growth
• Deepen relationships with existing merchants. Currently, our transactions represent a modest percentage of the average transaction volume for merchants on the platform. We believe we can increase our share of existing merchants’ overall transaction volumes with our technology, by proactively building relationships with merchants and our customer base through dedicated sales and customer success teams.
•  Partner expansion. We have identified thousands of eligible merchants offering durable goods that could benefit from access to our platform. We plan to pursue business relationships with eligible merchants on these platforms, as well as identify and integrate our platform into new or emerging systems and networks to attract additional merchant communities. Additionally, we launched our mobile app featuring Katapult Pay which allows our customers to complete a lease-to-own transaction with merchants. 
•  New merchant and partner POS integrations. We have the opportunity to increase the number of direct merchants integrated on the network through our dedicated sales team and referral relationships.
Expand Consumer Reach
• Add more consumers to the network. As more consumers join the network, our risk models become more efficient and robust, thereby positioning us to reach more non-prime consumers reliably. Direct merchant co-marketing initiatives intend to attract new consumers to try lease-to-own as a payment preference.
• Drive repeat use. We aim to continue driving repeat use of our platform by treating customers with respect, identifying consumer needs and focusing on customer satisfaction, paired with delivering data analytics to merchants to support shopping behaviors.
• Innovate on new product solutions. We are focused on innovating and bringing new financial partnerships and products to market for non-prime consumers. In addition to our mobile app featuring Katapult Pay we plan to continue product development with the goal of helping merchants increase conversion rates, repeat transaction rates and customer satisfaction.
Competition
We compete with national, regional and local operators of lease-to-own stores, virtual lease-to-own companies, traditional and e-commerce retailers (including many that offer layaway programs and/or installment payment options), traditional and online sellers of new and used merchandise, and various types of consumer finance companies that may enable customers to shop at traditional or online retailers, as well as with rental stores that do not offer their customers a purchase option.
Sales and Marketing
Our marketing strategy includes brand marketing, communications, and co-marketing campaigns that we collaborate on with our direct merchants. Brand marketing increases awareness among consumers and merchants, helping them understand the benefits of our platform. We utilize dedicated sales teams and leverage strategic partnerships with other platforms to expand our merchant and consumer base.
Seasonality
We experience seasonal fluctuations in our revenue as a result of consumer spending patterns. Historically, our revenue is moderately seasonal and strongest during the first quarter primarily due to historically gradual increases in the fourth quarter as a result of the holiday season, as well as the receipt by our customers in the first quarter of federal and state income tax refunds. Our customers will more frequently exercise the early purchase option on their existing lease agreements or purchase merchandise during the first quarter of the year. Adverse events that occur during these months could have a disproportionate effect on our financial results for the fiscal year.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
Human Capital Oversight
Our employees are critical to our success. As of December 31, 2022, we had 120 employees primarily located in the United States. We reduced our number of employees to 99 as of February 28, 2023 in connection with certain cost-savings initiatives that we began in the fourth quarter of 2022 to further reduce expenses. We also engage a small number of consultants and contractors to supplement our permanent workforce. To date, we have not experienced any work stoppages and maintain good working relationships with our employees. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement or are represented by a labor union at this time.
At Katapult, our people are our most valuable resource and critical to our success. We believe in an open and collaborative work environment which encourages employees to be accountable and take ownership in their performance and development. Our executive management team creates a culture and environment where every team member can achieve success. The Compensation Committee of our board of directors is engaged in the oversight of our employees, work environment, and compensation practices, and receives regular updates from management on progress and developments, and our executive management team and Compensation Committee receive regular reports on progress against our annual human resources goals.
We offer competitive compensation to attract and retain top talent. Our total compensation packages generally include market-competitive salary, bonus, sales commissions and equity awards. We strive to provide competitive compensation packages to all employee positions consistent with skill level, geographic location and experience. At least annually, we review our compensation practices internally and with the assistance of a third-party compensation consultant.
Regulatory
Government Regulation
Our operations are governed by the requirements of numerous federal and state laws, and by the agencies that interpret and enforce those laws. This summary is not intended to be a complete summary of the laws referred to below or of all the laws regulating our operations. 
There are currently 46 states, plus the District of Columbia, that have enacted lease-purchase statutes which set forth core requirements for our personal property lease-purchase transactions. These laws dictate our obligations with regard to consumer disclosures, pricing maximums, fees, and marketing, among other requirements. These laws may change, or the agencies charged with overseeing these laws may issue future guidance on the interpretation of these laws that is new, unforeseen, or otherwise conflicts with our current practices. Violations of these state lease-purchase laws can result in material penalties. We are unable to predict the nature or effect on our operations or earnings of unknown future legislation, regulations, agency interpretations and guidance, or judicial or administrative decisions concerning the laws governing our operations, and there can be no assurance that future laws, regulations, interpretations or decisions will not have a material adverse effect on our operations, earnings or financial condition. 
We are also required to be licensed in certain states in order to engage in lease-purchase transactions. While we hold required licenses, such licensing requirements could unexpectedly change which in turn could impact our operations.
Regarding federal law, at the present time, no federal law specifically regulates the core lease-purchase transaction offered by us. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”) does not regulate leases with terms of less than 90 days. Katapult’s lease-purchase transactions carry terms of, at most, month-to-month, and therefore are less than 90 days, such that the transactions do not fall within the transactions specifically covered by Dodd-Frank. These issues notwithstanding, various aspects of our business are governed by federal laws and regulations. For example, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) oversees business practices that are unfair, deceptive or fraudulent to consumers, including within the lease-purchase industry. As such, we seek to ensure that we comply with FTC rules and regulations relating to our operations and we pursue compliance management practices to do so; however, any violation of such rules or regulations could have a material adverse impact on our operations.
Also, state and federal regulatory authorities, including state attorneys general offices, state agencies such as the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, and the FTC, are increasingly focused on the consumer financial marketplace and personal property leasing generally. At any time, these agencies could initiate new investigations or otherwise take action that could result in significant adverse changes in the regulatory landscape for the lease-purchase industry in which we operate. We cannot predict whether any state attorneys general, state consumer protection agency, or federal regulatory agency will direct investigations or regulatory initiatives towards us or our industry in the future, or what the impact of any such future action(s) might be.
In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store, transfer and otherwise process personal data, including sensitive personal data. Accordingly, we are, or may become, subject to numerous data privacy and security obligations, including federal, state, local, and foreign laws, regulations, rules, guidance and standards related to data privacy and security. Such obligations may include, without limitation, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (collectively “CCPA”).
The CCPA is an example of the increasingly stringent and evolving regulatory frameworks related to personal data processing that may increase our compliance obligations and exposure for any noncompliance. The CCPA imposes obligations on covered businesses to provide certain disclosures related to a business’s collection, use and disclosure of personal data and gives California residents the right to, among other things, request disclosure of personal data collected about them and whether that data has been sold to others, request deletion of personal data (subject to certain exceptions), opt out of the sale of their personal data and not be discriminated against for exercising these rights. The CCPA provides for civil penalties and a private right of action for data breaches which may include an award of statutory damages. A number of other U.S. states have also enacted, or are considering enacting, comprehensive data privacy laws that share similarities with the CCPA, with at least four such laws (in Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut and Utah) having taken effect, or scheduled to take effect, in 2023. Certain state laws and regulations may be more stringent, broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights, with respect to personal information than federal or other state laws and regulations, and such laws and regulations may differ from each other, which may complicate compliance efforts and increase compliance costs. There is also discussion in Congress of a new federal data privacy and security law to which we may become subject if it is enacted. In addition, laws in all 50 U.S. states generally require businesses to provide notice under certain circumstances to consumers whose personal data has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. These laws are not consistent, and compliance in the event of a widespread data breach is difficult and may be costly. Furthermore, U.S. federal and state consumer protection laws require us to publish statements that accurately and fairly describe how we handle personal data and choices individuals may have about the way we handle their personal data. 
As a Company, we seek to ensure that all employees act in a legal, ethical and dignified manner and carry out the Company’s business consistent with such standards and consistent with the laws discussed above. See the section titled “Risk Factors” for additional information about the laws and regulations to which we are, or may become subject and about the risks to our business associated with such laws and regulations.
Intellectual Property
Intellectual property and proprietary rights are important to the success of our business. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws in the United States, as well as license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and other contractual protections, to establish and protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, including our proprietary technology, software, know-how, and brand. However, these laws, agreements, and procedures provide only limited protection. As of December 31, 2022, we owned three registered trademarks and one trademark application in the United States.
Although we take steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will be sufficient or effective to prevent the unauthorized access, use, copying, reverse engineering, infringement, misappropriation or other violation of our intellectual property and proprietary technology and information, including by third parties who may use our intellectual property or proprietary technology or information to develop services that compete with ours.
See the section titled “Risk Factors” for a more comprehensive description of risks related to our intellectual property and proprietary rights.
