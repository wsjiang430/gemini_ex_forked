  Overview
 
 RumbleOn, Inc., a Nevada corporation, is a technology driven, motor vehicle dealer and e-commerce platform provider disrupting the vehicle supply chain using innovative technology that aggregates, processes and distributes inventory in a faster and more cost-efficient manner.
 
 We operate an infrastructure-light platform that facilitates the ability of all participants in the supply chain, including RumbleOn, other dealers and consumers to Buy-Sell-Trade-Finance-Transport pre-owned vehicles.  Our goal is to transform the way VIN-specific pre-owned vehicles are bought and sold by providing users with the most comprehensive, efficient, timely and transparent transaction experiences. While our initial customer facing emphasis through most of 2018 was on motorcycles and other powersports, we continue to enhance our platform to accommodate nearly any VIN-specific vehicle including motorcycles, ATVs, boats, RVs, cars and trucks, and via our acquisition of Wholesale, Inc. in October 2018, we are making a concerted effort to grow our cars and light truck categories.
 
 In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this "Form 10-K"), we refer to RumbleOn, Inc., formerly Smart Server, Inc., as "RumbleOn," "RMBL," the "Company," "we," "us," and "our," and similar words.
 
  Our Model
 
 RumbleOn’s goal is to disrupt the inefficient, friction-laden pre-owned vehicle supply chain through the use of innovative technology. We have created a modern, technology-based platform to acquire and distribute inventory transparently and efficiently at value-oriented prices. We intend to leverage this platform to maximize the overall profit and return on vehicles that RumbleOn buys/sells for its own account as well to provide both dealers and consumers technology-based tools, financing and logistics-based solutions to simplify their business or aid them through the complex process of buying/selling a vehicle.
 
 Our model is anchored on powerful technology that enables RumbleOn to efficiently acquire, process (including reconditioning, photos and inspection), and distribute vehicles. Collectively, this allows us to maximize inventory value and reduce inventory risk as we penetrate the entire vehicle supply chain in a faster and more cost-efficient manner. There are two critical inputs that are key to understanding how we do this: 1) our innovative technology and 2) our inventory management.
 
  Innovative Technology
 
 Technology underpins everything at RumbleOn. If you want to disrupt an industry, you have to have answer two fundamental questions:
 
  1)            
 What can we do to eliminate existing customer pain points? and


  2)            
 How do we remove friction from a marketplace rooted in the past?


 We leverage technology to drive change in an industry that is almost as old as the automobile or motorcycle itself. At a very high-level, we believe there are two main areas where leveraging these innovations provides us a competitive advantage – 1) our proprietary supply chain and distribution software and 2) and our mobile-first web and application strategy.
 
 We utilize internally developed software to look at the overall supply chain and reconfigure inventory distribution. Our in-house, proprietary software pulls from multiple data sources in real-time, tracking and cataloging inventory across the country. Because we allow for two-way dataflows, our regional partners can tap into our software and easily update their inventory databases as vehicles are reconditioned and sold through any channel.
 
 We analyze market dynamics at scale to inform our acquisition decisions, continually capturing listings, sales, and registration information, to calibrate national price, inbound freight and depreciation estimates using advanced algorithms and linear process trees. The values are then used in our Cash Offer tool to quickly determine a fair and reasonable, non-negotiable offer to the customer.

 Lastly, we continue to refine our website and mobile application to provide not only a compelling user experience, from the front-end user interface and powerful search tools to enabling secure data, document and payment exchanges between private parties, but also to help optimize search engine marketing and lower overall cost of customer acquisition. For example, the RumbleOn app has features such as auto-populating details into the Cash Offer tool when a customer scans their VIN, we introduced simplified uploading of vehicle pictures by app users, we integrated technologies to try and block inappropriate content on our Classifieds site, and we are creating fun social experiences like our Road Trip Planner.
 
  Inventory Management
 
 We believe our ability to access and acquire inventory efficiently and cost effectively, from both consumers and dealers, is a key differentiator for RumbleOn. Using pre-owned retail and wholesale vehicle market data obtained from a variety of internal and external data sources, we evaluate a significant number of vehicles daily across both online and traditional auction/dealer-based channels to determine their fit with end-buyer demand, internal profitability targets and our existing inventory mix.

 The supply of pre-owned vehicles is influenced by a variety of factors, including: the total number of vehicles in operation; the rate of new vehicle sales, which in turn generate pre-owned vehicles; the number of pre-owned vehicles sold or remarketed through our consumer and dealer channels; model-year changes; fleet turnover; seasonality; natural disasters; and economic downturns.
 
 As such, we are very focused on nimbly managing our overall inventory, and our current average days to sale is less than 30 days. We believe this not only minimizes potential reduction in profits for negatively impacting items such as the above but also provides us significant competitive benefits; namely: i) we have flexibility to adjust our inventory in response to unforeseen market dynamics – such as the unusually cold winter we experienced across the United States, and delayed tax refunds due to the government shutdown; and ii) we can make swift decisions to capitalize on market anomalies or leverage arbitrage opportunities that should benefit volume and margins in a more consistent fashion.
 
 To support our emphasis on inventory management and reduction or capital investment needs, we leverage a robust partner network that manages the reconditioning, inspections and distribution of our inventory. Our regional partners are located in the cities below:
 
  Cincinnati, OH; Dallas, TX; Daytona Beach, FL; Fontana, CA;
   Atlanta, GA; Greensboro, NC; Indianapolis, IN;
   Kansas City, KS; Madison, WI; Manheim, PA; Nashville, TN;
   Orlando, FL; San Diego, CA; San Francisco, CA;
   Spokane, WA; Statesville, NC;
   West Palm Beach, FL; Windsor, CT
 
 Every unit of inventory we acquire is posted immediately to both our website and Dealer Direct tool as well as sent to one of our regional partners who then update photographs, detailed inspection reports and is set for live auction sale in the near future. Once the vehicle is sold, it is reconditioned to the appropriate level for the buyer, which reduces unnecessary reconditioning costs and enables us to protect our margin when selling directly to a dealer who might prefer to manage or perform reconditioning to their standards. More importantly, we are able to quickly establish new regional partners as needed to reduce our cost of sales and freight expense while creating more capacity for over-all sales growth.
 Competitive Positioning
 
 We believe we are filling a massive void in the market and unlike others, we are using this data-powered technology to serve consumers, dealers and service providers across the entire supply chain. Our comprehensive offering includes the following:

 Over time, we will be buying and selling the same inventory and delivering the same customer experience across our three primary websites - the RumbleOn marketplace, RumbleOn Dealer Direct and Wholesale Inc., powered by RumbleOn - providing us with a strategic advantage of having vertical brands. These solutions exist as separate websites and each fills a gap in the legacy buying and selling experience while taking advantage of vertical search of the same inventory across multiple consumer and dealer channels.
 
 RumbleOn.com is our primary national online consumer facing platform. Consumers can currently get a real Cash Offer for their powersport vehicles as well as purchase powersports vehicles through this website; in the coming months they will be able to do the same for cars and light trucks. Customers can pay for their vehicle using cash or they may select from a range of finance options from unrelated third parties such as banks or credit unions, as well as in the near future, RumbleOn Finance, our own in-house lender. Additionally, customers have the option to protect their vehicle with Extended Protection Plans ("EPPs") and vehicle appearance protection products as part of our online checkout process. EPPs include extended service plans which are designed to cover unexpected expenses associated with mechanical breakdowns and guaranteed asset protection, which is intended to cover the unpaid balance on a vehicle loan in the event of a total loss of the vehicle or unrecovered theft.
 
 RumbleOn Dealer Direct is currently being used by multiple dealers in the powersports space which allows them to leverage the RumbleOn inventory as a virtual inventory of their own at wholesale values without waiting for auction day. We intend to add cars and trucks to Dealer Direct and incorporate added functionality for dealers to filter by vehicle type when looking to make a purchase.
 
 Wholesale Inc., Powered by RumbleOn (as well as any other sub-brands we ultimately may utilize) – To the extent we acquire a business which has significant local brand awareness, we will likely take advantage of existing organic search benefits and customer goodwill by creating a locally branded website with most of the same functionality as RumbleOn.com.
 
 RumbleOn Classifieds was soft-launched in December 2018 and is a one-stop listing site for consumers who wish to pursue peer-to-peer transaction, similar to Craigslist. For a listing fee, consumers list the vehicle at the price they wish. RumbleOn then offers both buyers and sells a suite of option tools to facilitate the transaction process, including assistance with titles, documentation, third-party inspection, financing, funds-transfer, and logistics. Classifieds allows us to not only buy more inventory from unsuccessful listings, but more importantly provide consumers who were unwilling to accept the RumbleOn Cash Offer price an opportunity to stay in the RumbleOn network and, for a small fee, extend the time RumbleOn is willing to honor the Cash Offer price.
 
 RumbleOn Finance - We are in the process of organizing and licensing RumbleOn Finance as a wholly owned consumer finance entity to provide vehicle buyer’s competitive borrowing alternatives. We expect to be originating transaction by the third quarter of 2019.

  Our Market / Competition
 
 We participate in both the automotive and powersports markets.
 
  Automotive
 
 The U.S. used car marketplace is highly fragmented, and we face competition from franchised dealers, who sell both new and used vehicles; independent used car dealers; online and mobile sales platforms; and private parties. There are approximately 16,700 franchised automotive dealerships, which sell both new and used vehicles, as well as approximately 43,000 used car dealerships in the U.S. with the top 100 used car retailers controlling approximately 7.0% market share according to various industry publications.
 
 Collectively, there were approximately 276 million registered vehicles in operation in 2018. Additionally, it is estimated that in 2018 approximately 17 million new cars and 40 million used cars were sold at retail, many of which were accompanied by trade-ins. Lastly, according to the National Auto Auction Association, more than 11.6 million vehicles were sold through auctions in 2018, with approximately 70% of the wholesale transactions being run through the two largest auction participants, Manheim and Adesa.
 
 Based on the large number of new and used vehicles being sold each year, coupled with the relatively small market share of any single used car seller, we believe that both sources of used vehicles, and our ability to sell them, will continue to be sufficient to meet our current and future needs.

  Powersports
 
 We currently operate in the powersports and recreational vehicle market with significant scale and breadth of products. The Motorcycle Industry Council estimates that in 2014, 9.2 million people owned 10.1 million motorcycles in the United States. 87% of these were on-highway models, our initial targeted segment. According to the Powersports Business 2016 Market Data Book, or the 2016 Market Data book, pre-owned motorcycle registrations were 1.1 million units in 2015 with new unit sales of approximately 573,000 or approximately $7 billion in new vehicle sales. The owner demographic is favorable to the market outlook as millennials and baby boomers are maturing into the median ranges. The owner group is characterized by brand loyal riding enthusiasts. According to the Motorcycle Industry Council, in 2014 the median owner age was 47 years with a median income of $62,200 which is approximately 10% above the United States' average. The dealer market is fragmented with an estimated 10,000 outlets authorized to sell powersports and recreation vehicles that include new and pre-owned motorcycles, scooter, and all-terrain vehicles.
 
 Our initial focus was on pre-owned Harley-Davidson motorcycles as it provided a targeted, identifiable segment to establish the functionality of the platform and the RumbleOn brand. Harley-Davidson is a highly regarded and dominant brand (representing approximately 50% market share of new 601cc+ on-road motorcycles according to both Harley-Davidson public filings and the Motorcycle Industry Council) in the motorcycle market, with a base of over three million pre-owned motorcycles registered for use in the United States. According to Harley-Davidson, as disclosed in their 2017 investor meeting presentation, and management estimates, each year approximately 400,000 pre-owned Harley-Davidsons are sold, with Harley-Davidson dealers selling approximately 125,000 units, 250,000 units sold in private consumer and independent dealer transactions, and 25,000 sold via other means. As our business has evolved we have expanded into other powersports and recreational vehicle with a strong emphasis on the "metric" brands of motorcycles (Honda, Yamaha, Kawasaki, Suzuki, etc.), which essentially doubled the available market and is a natural extension as these vehicles are often sold or traded for Harley-Davidson vehicles. The metric market and dealer profile closely mirror that of the Harley-Davidson market although it is more highly fragmented and the average pre-owned vehicle selling price is less than a pre-owned Harley Davidson. In addition, many of the metric dealers also retail other powersport vehicles including ATVs, UTVs, snowmobiles and personal watercraft providing RumbleOn an opportunity for product extensions by leveraging existing regional partner relationships.
 
 The ATV, UTV/side-by-side, snowmobile and personal watercraft vehicle, or PWC, markets, are a logical next extension for our platform, as there is significant overlap in the motorcycle dealer base with dealers of these products. According to data from Power Product Marketing and the 2016 Market Data Book, there were approximately 630,000 sales of ATV/UTV/side-by-sides in 2015. There are approximately 1.2 million snowmobiles registered in the United States (another 600,000 in Canada) and in 2016, approximately 95,000 snowmobiles were sold in the United States and Canada. Lastly, according the National Marine Manufacturers Association and the Personal Watercraft Industry Association, in 2015 there were more than 54,000 new PWCs sold in the United States and there are currently approximately 1.2 million PWCs registered in the United States.
 
 As we look to further extend the platform, the two largest adjacent segments are represented by the recreational boating and recreational vehicle (motor vehicle or trailer equipped with living space and amenities found in a home) industries. According to the National Marine Manufacturers Association, there were approximately 15.7 million recreational boats in the United States in 2014, and there were approximately 940,000 sales of pre-owned boats in 2014. Correspondingly, the Recreational Vehicle Industry Association estimates that currently more than 8.9 million households own an RV and in 2017 there will be over 470,000 shipments of RVs from manufacturers to dealers.
 
 The United States pre-owned powersports and recreational vehicle marketplace is highly fragmented, and we face competition from franchised dealers, who sell both new and pre-owned vehicles; independent dealers; online and mobile sales platforms; and private parties. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our industry are delivering an outstanding consumer experience, competitive sourcing of vehicles, breadth and depth of product selection, and value pricing. Our competitors vary in size and breadth of their product offerings. We believe that our principal competitive advantages in pre-owned vehicle retailing includes our ability to provide a high degree of customer satisfaction with the buying experience by virtue of our low, no-haggle prices and our 100% online marketplace platform including our website and mobile application and our ability to make a cash offer to purchase a vehicle with our customer-friendly sales process and our breadth of selection of the most popular makes and models available on our website. In addition, we believe our willingness to make a cash offer to purchase a customer's vehicle, whether or not the customer is buying a vehicle from us, provides a competitive sourcing advantage for retail vehicles allowing us to offer value-oriented pricing. We believe the principal competitive factors for our ancillary products and services include an ability to offer a full suite of products at competitive prices delivered in an efficient manner to the customer. We will compete with a variety of entities in offering these products including banks, finance companies, insurance and warranty providers and extended vehicle service contract providers. We believe our competitive strengths in this category will include our ability to deliver products in an efficient manner to customers utilizing our technology and our ability to partner with key participants in each category to offer a full suite of products at competitive prices. Lastly, additional competitors may enter the businesses in which we will operate.

 The supply of pre-owned vehicles, including automobiles, light trucks and powersports, is influenced by a variety of factors, including: the total number of vehicles in operation; the rate of new vehicle sales, which in turn generate pre-owned vehicles; and the number of pre-owned vehicles sold or remarketed through our consumer and dealer channels. Based on the large number of new and used vehicles being sold each year, coupled with the relatively small market share of any single used car seller, we believe that both sources of used vehicles, and our ability to sell them, will continue to be sufficient to meet our current and future needs.
 
  Seasonality
 
 Historically, both the automotive and powersport industries have been seasonal with traffic and sales strongest in the spring and summer quarters. Sales and traffic are typically slowest in the fall quarter but increase in February and March, coinciding with tax refund season. Given this seasonality, coupled with the fact that we are a growing company, leads us to expect our quarterly results of operations, including our revenue, gross profit, profit/loss, and cash flow to vary significantly in the future, based in part on vehicle buying patterns. Over time, we expect to normalize to seasonal trends in both markets, with the corresponding impact that may result from the overall economic conditions.
 Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
 
 Our brand image and intellectual property is a critical element of our business strategy.  As of December 31, 2018, we have a trademark registration for "RumbleOn", a patent covering near field communications to store and retrieve vehicle information, and various applications pending with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
 Government Regulation
 
 Various aspects of our business are or may be subject, directly or indirectly, to U.S. federal and state laws and regulations. Failure to comply with such laws or regulations may result in the suspension or termination of our ability to do business in affected jurisdictions or the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties, including fines or the award of significant damages against us and our dealers in class action or other civil litigation.
 State Motor Vehicle Sales, Advertising and Brokering Laws
 
 The advertising and sale of new or pre-owned motor vehicles is highly regulated by the states in which we do business. Although we do not anticipate selling new vehicles, state regulatory authorities or third parties could take the position that some of the regulations applicable to new vehicle dealers or to the manner in which automobiles, powersports and recreational vehicles are advertised and sold generally are directly applicable to our business. If our products and services are determined to not comply with relevant regulatory requirements, we could be subject to significant civil and criminal penalties, including fines, or the award of significant damages in class action or other civil litigation as well as orders interfering with our ability to continue providing our products and services in certain states. In addition, even absent such a determination, to the extent dealers are uncertain about the applicability of such laws and regulations to our business, we may lose, or have difficulty increasing the number of dealers in our network, which would affect our future growth.
 
 Several states have laws and regulations that strictly regulate or prohibit the brokering of motor vehicles or the making of so-called "bird-dog" payments by dealers to third parties in connection with the sale of motor vehicles through persons other than licensed salespersons. If our products or services are determined to fall within the scope of such laws or regulations, we may be forced to implement new measures, which could be costly, to reduce our exposure to those obligations, including the discontinuation of certain products or services in affected jurisdictions. Additionally, such a determination could subject us to significant civil or criminal penalties, including fines, or the award of significant damages in class action or other civil litigation.
 
 In addition to generally applicable consumer protection laws, many states in which we may do business either have or may implement laws and regulations that specifically regulate the advertising for sale of new or pre-owned automobiles, powersports and recreational vehicles. These state advertising laws and regulations may not be uniform from state to state, sometimes imposing inconsistent requirements on the advertiser. If the content displayed on the websites we operate is determined or alleged to be inaccurate or misleading, we could be subject to significant civil and criminal penalties, including fines, or the award of significant damages in class action or other civil litigation. Moreover, such allegations, even if unfounded or decided in our favor, could be extremely costly to defend, could require us to pay significant sums in settlements, and could interfere with our ability to continue providing our products and services in certain states.

  Federal Advertising Regulations
 
 The Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") has authority to take actions to remedy or prevent advertising practices that it considers to be unfair or deceptive and that affect commerce in the United States. If the FTC takes the position in the future that any aspect of our business constitutes an unfair or deceptive advertising practice, responding to such allegations could require us to pay significant damages, settlements, and civil penalties, or could require us to make adjustments to our products and services, any or all of which could result in substantial adverse publicity, loss of participating dealers, lost revenue, increased expenses, and decreased profitability.
 Federal Antitrust Laws
 
 The antitrust laws prohibit, among other things, any joint conduct among competitors that would lessen competition in the marketplace. Some of the information that we may obtain from dealers may be sensitive and, if disclosed inappropriately, could potentially be pre-owned by dealers to impede competition or otherwise diminish independent pricing activity. A governmental or private civil action alleging the improper exchange of information, or unlawful participation in price maintenance or other unlawful or anticompetitive activity, even if unfounded, could be costly to defend and adversely impact our ability to maintain and grow our dealer network.
 
 In addition, governmental or private civil actions related to the antitrust laws could result in orders suspending or terminating our ability to do business or otherwise altering or limiting certain of our business practices, including the manner in which we handle or disclose pricing information, or the imposition of significant civil or criminal penalties, including fines or the award of significant damages against us in class action or other civil litigation.
 
 The foregoing description of laws and regulations to which we are or may be subject is not exhaustive, and the regulatory framework governing our operations is subject to continuous change. The enactment of new laws and regulations or the interpretation of existing laws and regulations in an unfavorable way may affect the operation of our business, directly or indirectly, which could result in substantial regulatory compliance costs, civil or criminal penalties, including fines, adverse publicity, loss of participating dealers, lost revenue, increased expenses, and decreased profitability. Further, investigations by government agencies, including the FTC, into allegedly anticompetitive, unfair, deceptive or other business practices by us, could cause us to incur additional expenses and, if adversely concluded, could result in substantial civil or criminal penalties and significant legal liability.
 
  Employees
 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 288 employees all of which are full-time.
 
  Corporate History
 
 RumbleOn, Inc. was originally incorporated in the State of Nevada in October 2013 as a development stage company under the name Smart Server, Inc. In July 2016, Berrard Holdings Limited Partnership ("Berrard Holdings") acquired 5,475,000 shares of common stock of the Company from the prior owner of such shares pursuant to an Amended and Restated Stock Purchase Agreement, dated July 13, 2016. The shares acquired by Berrard Holdings represented 99.5% of the Company's issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Steven Berrard, a director and our Chief Financial Officer, has voting and dispositive control over Berrard Holdings. The aggregate purchase price of the shares was $148,141. In addition, at the closing, Berrard Holdings loaned the Company, and the Company executed a promissory note, in the principal amount of $191,858 payable to Berrard Holdings. Effective August 31, 2017, the note was amended to increase the principal amount by $5,500 to $197,358 in aggregate amount payable to Berrard Holdings.
 
 In October 2016, Berrard Holdings sold an aggregate of 3,312,500 shares of the Company's common stock to Marshall Chesrown, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and certain other purchasers. The 2,412,500 shares acquired by Mr. Chesrown represented 43.9% of the Company's issued and outstanding shares of common stock. The remaining shares owned by Berrard Holdings after giving effect to the transaction represented 39.3% of the Company's issued and outstanding shares of common stock.
 
 On November 28, 2016, the Company completed a private placement with certain purchasers, with respect to the sale of an aggregate of 900,000 shares of common stock of the Company at a purchase price of $1.50 per share for total consideration of $1,350,000 (the "2016 Private Placement").

 On January 8, 2017, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "NextGen Agreement") with NextGen, Halcyon Consulting, LLC ("Halcyon"), and members of Halcyon signatory thereto ("Halcyon Members," and together with Halcyon, the "Halcyon Parties") pursuant to which NextGen agreed to sell to the Company substantially all of the assets of NextGen in exchange for a payment of approximately $750,000 in cash, the issuance to NextGen of 1,523,809 unregistered shares of Company common stock (the "Purchaser Shares"), the issuance of a subordinated secured promissory note issued by the Company in favor of NextGen in the amount of $1,333,333 (the "Acquisition Note") and the assumption by the Company of certain specified post-closing liabilities of NextGen under the contracts being assigned to the Company as part of the transaction (the "NextGen Acquisition"). On February 8, 2017, the Company assigned to NextGen Pro, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ("NextGen Pro"), the right to acquire NextGen's assets and liabilities (but not any other rights or obligations under the NextGen Agreement).
 
 On January 9, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") and stockholders holding 6,375,000 of the Company's issued and outstanding shares of common stock approved an amendment to the Company's Articles of Incorporation (the "Certificate of Amendment") to change the name Smart Server, Inc. to RumbleOn, Inc. and to create an additional class of Company common stock. The Certificate of Amendment became effective on February 13, 2017 (the "Effective Date"), after the notice and accompanying Information Statement describing the amendment was furnished to non-consenting stockholders of the Company in accordance with Nevada and Federal securities law.
 
 Immediately before approving the Certificate of Amendment, the Company had authorized 100,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value (the "Authorized Common Stock"), including 6,400,000 issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the "Outstanding Common Stock," and together with the Authorized Common Stock, the "Common Stock"). Pursuant to the Certificate of Amendment, the Company designated 1,000,000 shares of Authorized Common Stock as Class A Common Stock (the "Class A Common Stock"), which Class A Common Stock ranks pari passu with all of the rights and privileges of the Common Stock, except that holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled to 10 votes per share of Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding and (ii) all other shares of Common Stock, including all shares of Outstanding Common Stock were deemed Class B Common Stock (the "Class B Common Stock"), which Class B Common Stock are identical to the Class A Common Stock in all respects, except that holders of Class B Common Stock will be entitled to one vote per share of Class B Common Stock issued and outstanding.
 
 On January 9, 2017, the Company's Board and stockholders holding 6,375,000 of the Company's issued and outstanding shares of common stock approved the issuance to (i) Mr. Chesrown of 875,000 shares of Class A Common Stock in exchange for an equal number of shares of Class B Common Stock held by Mr. Chesrown, and (ii) Mr. Berrard of 125,000 shares of Class A Common Stock in exchange for an equal number of shares of Class B Common Stock held by Mr. Berrard.
 
 Also, on February 8, 2017 (the "Closing Date"), RumbleOn and NextGen Pro completed the NextGen Acquisition in exchange for approximately $750,000 in cash, the Purchaser Shares, the Acquisition Note, and the other consideration described above. The Acquisition Note matures on the third anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Maturity Date"). Interest accrues and will be paid semi-annually (i) at a rate of 6.5% annually from the Closing Date through the second anniversary of such date and (ii) at a rate of 8.5% annually from the second anniversary of the Closing Date through the Maturity Date. The Company's obligations under the Acquisition Note are secured by substantially all the assets of the NextGen Pro pursuant to an Unconditional Guaranty Agreement (the "Guaranty Agreement"), by and among NextGen and NextGen Pro, and a related Security Agreement between the parties, each dated as of the Closing Date. Under the terms of the Guaranty Agreement, NextGen Pro has agreed to guarantee the performance of all of the Company's obligations under the Acquisition Note.
 
 On March 31, 2017, we completed funding of the second tranche of the 2016 Private Placement. The purchasers were issued 1,161,920 shares of Class B Common Stock and notes in the aggregate principal amount of $667,000, (the "Private Placement Notes"), in consideration of cancellation of loan agreements having an aggregate principal amount committed by the purchasers of $1,350,000. 
 
 Also, on March 31, 2017, we completed the sale of 620,000 shares of Class B Common Stock, at a price of $4.00 per share for aggregate proceeds of $2,480,000 in a private placement offering, (the "2017 Private Placement.") We sold an additional 37,500 shares of Class B Common Stock in connection with the 2017 Private Placement on April 30, 2017. Our officers and directors acquired 175,000 shares of Class B Common Stock in the 2017 Private Placement. Proceeds from the 2017 Private Placement were used to complete the launch of our website, acquire vehicle inventory, continue development of our platform, and for working capital purposes.

 On October 23, 2017, the Company completed an underwritten public offering (the "2017 Public Offering") of 2,910,000 shares of the Company's Class B Common Stock at a price of $5.50 per share for net proceeds to the Company of approximately $14.5 million. In connection with the 2017 Public Offering, on October 19, 2017, the Class B Common Stock uplisted from the OTCQB and began trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol "RMBL."
 
 On July 20, 2018, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of 2,328,750 shares of its Class B Common Stock at a price of $6.05 per share for net proceeds to the Company of approximately $13,015,825 million. The completed offering included 303,750 shares of Class B Common Stock issued upon the underwriter's exercise in full of its over-allotment option.
