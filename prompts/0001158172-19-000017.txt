ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
We are a global information and analytics company that measures consumer audiences and advertising across media platforms. We create our products using a global data platform that combines information about content and advertising consumption on digital platforms (smartphones, tablets and computers), television ("TV") and movie screens with demographics and other descriptive information. We have developed proprietary data science that enables measurement of person-level and household-level audiences, removing duplicated viewing across devices and over time. This combination of data and methods helps companies across the media ecosystem better understand and monetize their audiences and develop marketing plans and products to more efficiently and effectively reach those audiences. Our ability to unify behavioral and other descriptive data enables us to provide accredited audience ratings, advertising verification, and granular consumer segments that describe hundreds of millions of consumers. Our customers include buyers and sellers of advertising including digital publishers, television networks, content owners, advertisers, agencies and technology providers.
The platforms we measure include televisions, smartphones, computers, tablets, over-the-top ("OTT") devices and movie theaters. The information we analyze crosses geographies, types of content and activities, including websites, mobile applications ("apps"), video games, television and movie programming, electronic commerce ("e-commerce") and advertising.
We are a Delaware corporation headquartered in Reston, Virginia with principal offices located at 11950 Democracy Drive, Suite 600, Reston, VA 20190. Our telephone number is 703-438-2000.

Background and Market
We were founded in 1999 on the belief that digital technology would transform the interactions between people, media and brands in ways that would generate substantial demand for data and analytics about that interaction. The growing adoption of digital 
1

technologies also allowed measurement of the behavior of consumers' online activities. Based on this vision, we built a global opt-in panel of over two million individuals that provided insight into online activities. In 2002, we acquired Media Metrix, an internet ratings brand with its own panel of consumers. Anticipating that mobile would become a key digital platform in the future, we acquired mobile measurement specialist M:Metrics in 2008. In 2009, we introduced our proprietary Unified Digital Measurement ("UDM") methodology, which allowed us to unite consumer panel data with census-level data from tags that we implemented on websites and their content and, later from software development kits on mobile apps. 
To expand our global presence in Latin America and Europe, respectively, we acquired Certifica in 2009 and NedStat in 2010. To enhance our product offerings and expand our presence in certain markets, we acquired ARS in 2010, M.Labs, LLC in 2014, Proximic, Inc. in 2015, and Compete, Inc. ("Compete") in 2016. As consumer media consumption and the availability of television and video programming expanded across a myriad of consumer devices, the ability to measure this dynamic cross-platform world became more important for buyers and sellers of advertising. In response, we partnered with ESPN and Arbitron to pioneer a cross-platform measurement solution, and in 2015 launched Xmedia, a syndicated cross-platform measurement product. Arbitron was later acquired by Nielsen Holdings N.V. ("Nielsen"), and we continue to have access to legacy Arbitron data through a 2013 license agreement with Nielsen. This cross-platform measurement strategy led to our 2015 strategic alliance with WPP plc (together with its affiliates, "WPP"), one of the largest communications services businesses in the world, and the 2016 merger with Rentrak Corporation ("Rentrak"), a global media measurement and advanced consumer targeting company serving the entertainment, television, video and advertising industries. Following the Rentrak merger, we now have access to millions of television and video on demand ("VOD") screens and the ability to measure box office results from movie screens across the world. We also have an opt-in Total Home Panel, which enables measurement of household devices that use a home’s internet connection, whether traditional mobile and computer devices, streaming media devices, gaming consoles or Internet of Things ("IOT") devices, which may include devices such as smart speakers, thermostats, and appliances.
Our Approach to Media Measurement
Our approach to measuring media consumption addresses the ubiquitous nature of media content and the fragmentation caused by the variety of platforms and technologies used to access such content. We believe this fragmentation presents major challenges to using legacy measurement systems that are comprised of relatively small panels of cooperating consumers or limited to specific media platforms. Our products and services are built on measurement and analytic capabilities comprised of broad-based data collection, proprietary databases, internally developed software and a computational infrastructure to measure, analyze and report on digital, television and movie activity at the level of granularity that we believe the media and advertising industries need. We have more than 100 patents covering various aspects of our data collection and data processing systems. 
Data Collection 
The following collection methods illustrate our extensive data sourcing:

• | We collect data from proprietary consumer panels that measure the use of computers, tablets and smartphones that access the internet. These panelists have agreed to install our passive metering software on their devices, home network or both.


• | We collect data from our near-census digital network whereby content publishers implement our software code (referred to as "tagging") on their websites, in mobile applications and video players to provide us usage information.


• | We license certain demographic and behavioral mobile and panel data from third-party data providers.


• | We obtain U.S. television viewership information from satellite, telecommunications and cable operators covering millions of television and VOD screens.


• | We measure gross receipts and attendance information from movie screens across the world.


• | We integrate our digital and television viewership information with other third-party datasets that include consumer demographic characteristics, attitudes, lifestyles and purchase behavior.


• | We integrate many of our services with ad serving platforms.


• | We utilize knowledgeable in-house industry analysts that span verticals such as pharmaceuticals, media, finance, consumer packaged goods and political information to add value to our data.


• | We have created an opt-in Total Home Panel which can capture data that run through a home’s internet connection. This expands our intelligence to include such activity as game console and IOT device usage.

Data Science and Management
The ability to integrate, manage and transform massive amounts of data is core to our company. We continue to invest in technologies to enable large-scale measurement with protection of consumer privacy and attractive economics. Our systems contain multiple redundancies and advanced distributed processing technologies. We have created innovations such as:

• | Our UDM methodology, which allows us to combine person-centric panel data with website server data. We believe this gives our customers greater accuracy, granularity and relevance in audience measurement.

2


• | An ability to de-duplicate audiences across platforms, which is based on direct observations within our consumer panel and census data combined with proprietary data science. This de-duplication allows us to measure the reach and frequency of advertising and content exposure across platforms and over time.


• | An ability to validate advertising delivery and detect fraud through our Invalid Traffic and Sophisticated Invalid Traffic filtration methods. These methods have been accredited by the Media Rating Council, which provides our customers with added assurances of validity and reliability.


• | An ability to capture the full content of a website or app session, which allows us to measure activity beyond page views such as purchase transactions, application submissions and product configurations.


• | An ability to intelligently categorize massive amounts of web content, which allows us to inform targeted and brand-safe advertising.

Product Delivery
We deliver our products and services through diverse methods to meet the needs of our customers. These include Software-as-a-Service delivery platforms, application programming interface and other data feeds that integrate directly with customer systems, and integrations with advertising technology providers such as data management platforms and demand-side platforms that enable data management, ad management and programmatic ad trading.

We believe we compete favorably on these factors and that our vision and investments in the future of media measurement across platforms will deliver products and services that our customers will continue to trust and value.
Government Regulation and Privacy 
U.S. and international data security and privacy laws apply to our various businesses. We have programs in place to detect, contain and respond to data security incidents; however, increasing technology risks or unauthorized users who successfully breach our network security could misappropriate or misuse our proprietary information or cause interruptions in our services. Many countries have data protection laws with different requirements than those in the U.S. and this may result in inconsistent requirements and differing interpretations across jurisdictions. Governments, privacy advocates and class action attorneys are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect, process, use, store, share and transmit personal data. New laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), Brazil's General Data Protection Law ("LGPD") and the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") in Europe and industry self-regulatory codes have been enacted, and more are being considered that will affect our ability (and our customers’ ability) to reach current and prospective customers, to respond to individual customer requests under the laws, and 
6

to implement our business models effectively. Both the CCPA and LGPD will come into effect in 2020. Similarly, the ePrivacy Regulation, which focuses on certain uses of electronic technologies, is expected to be adopted. The GDPR took effect in May 2018 and includes additional requirements regarding the collection and handling of individuals’ personal data. Failure to meet the GDPR requirements, or privacy requirements in other jurisdictions, could result in substantial penalties. 
We participate in the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Economic Area and Switzerland to the U.S.  We also monitor actions by the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission, including regulatory developments affecting Internet Service Providers. 
Where we receive data from third-party service providers, our contracts with such providers obligate them to meet privacy and data security standards set forth therein, including a requirement to obtain appropriate consent or provide another appropriate legal basis for collection. Our policies and protocols are designed to be consistent with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Inc. ("AICPA") and the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants ("CICA") Trust Service Principles criteria for online privacy.
Employees
As of January 31, 2019, we had approximately 1,800 employees. We believe our employee relations are good. Our employees are not represented by labor unions outside of those few countries where union representation is a mandatory practice for doing business.
