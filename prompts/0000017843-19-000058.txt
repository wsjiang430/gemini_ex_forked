Item 1.  Business

(a)             General Development of Business:

Carpenter Technology Corporation, founded in 1889, is engaged in the manufacturing, fabrication and distribution of specialty metals. As used throughout this report, unless the context requires otherwise, the terms “Carpenter”, “Company”, “Registrant”, “Issuer”, “we” and “our” refer to Carpenter Technology Corporation.

(b)             Financial Information About Segments:

We are organized in two reportable business segments: Specialty Alloys Operations (“SAO”) and Performance Engineered Products (“PEP”). See Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional segment reporting information.

(c)              Narrative Description of Business:
 (1)               General:

We are a recognized leader in high-performance specialty alloy-based materials and process solutions for critical applications in the aerospace, defense, transportation, energy, industrial, medical and consumer end-use markets. We have evolved to become a pioneer in premium specialty alloys, including titanium, nickel, and cobalt, as well as alloys specifically engineered for additive manufacturing processes and soft magnetics applications. We have expanded our additive manufacturing capabilities to provide a complete “end-to-end” solution to accelerate materials innovation and streamline parts production. 
Reportable Segments

The SAO segment is comprised of the Company’s major premium alloy and stainless steel manufacturing operations. This includes operations performed at mills primarily in Reading and Latrobe, Pennsylvania and surrounding areas as well as South Carolina and Alabama. The combined assets of the SAO segment are managed in an integrated manner to optimize efficiency and profitability across the total system.

The PEP segment is comprised of the Company’s differentiated operations. This segment includes the Dynamet titanium business, the Carpenter Powder Products business, the Amega West business, the CalRAM business, the LPW Technology Ltd. business and the Latrobe and Mexico distribution businesses. The businesses in the PEP segment are managed with an entrepreneurial structure to promote speed and flexibility and drive overall revenue and profit growth. 
(2)                 Raw Materials:

Our business depends on continued receipt of critical raw materials for our day to day operations. These raw materials include nickel, cobalt, chromium, manganese, molybdenum, titanium, iron and scrap containing the named alloys. Some of the sources of these raw materials, many of which are international, could be subject to potential interruptions of supply as a result of political events, labor unrest or other reasons. These potential interruptions could cause material shortages and affect availability and price. We have arrangements with certain vendors to provide consigned materials at our manufacturing facilities available for our consumption as necessary.

We have long-term relationships with major suppliers who provide availability of material at competitive prices. Purchase prices of certain raw materials have historically been volatile. We use pricing surcharges, indexing mechanisms, base price adjustments and raw material forward contracts to reduce the impact on our business of increased costs for the most significant of these materials. There can be delays between the time of the increase in the price of raw materials and the realization of the benefits of such mechanisms or actions that could have a short-term impact on our results and could affect the comparability of our results from period to period.

(3)                 Patents and Licenses:

We own a number of United States and international patents and have granted licenses under some of them. In addition, certain products that we produce are covered by patents held or owned by other companies from whom licenses have been obtained. The duration of a patent issued in the United States is between 14 and 20 years from the date of filing a patent application or issuance of the patents. The durations of patents issued outside of the United States varies from country to country. Generally, patent licenses are structured to match the duration of the underlying patent. Although these patents and licenses are believed to be of value, we do not consider our business to be materially dependent upon any single such item or related group of such items.
(4)                Seasonality of Business:

Our sales are normally influenced by seasonal factors. Historically, our sales in the first two fiscal quarters (the respective three months ending September 30 and December 31) are typically the lowest, principally because of annual plant vacation and maintenance shutdowns by us, as well as by many of our customers. However, the timing of major changes in the general economy or the markets for certain products can alter this historical pattern.

The chart below summarizes the percent of net sales by quarter for the past three fiscal years:


Quarter Ended | 2019 | | 2018 | | 2017
September 30, | 24 | % | | 22 | % | 22 | %
December 31, | 23 | | | 22 | | 24 | 
March 31, | 26 | | | 27 | | 26 | 
June 30, | 27 | | | 29 | | 28 | 
 | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

(5)                 Customers:

On a consolidated basis, we are not dependent upon a single customer, or very few customers, such that the loss of any one or more particular customers would have a materially adverse effect on our consolidated statement of income. One customer, Arconic Inc., accounted for approximately 11 percent, 12 percent and 11 percent of net sales for the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Approximately 12 percent of the accounts receivable outstanding at June 30, 2019 is due from one customer, Arconic Inc. No single customer accounted for 10 percent or more of the accounts receivable outstanding at June 30, 2018. See Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional information.
(6)                Backlog:

As of June 30, 2019, we had a sales backlog of orders excluding surcharge, believed to be firm, of approximately $800 million, substantially all of which is expected to be shipped within fiscal year 2020. Our backlog of orders excluding surcharge as of June 30, 2018 was approximately $568 million.

(7)                Competition:

We are leaders in specialty materials for critical applications with 130 years of metallurgical and manufacturing expertise. Our business is highly competitive. We manufacture and supply materials to a variety of end-use market sectors and compete with various companies depending on the end-use market, product or geography. A significant portion of the products we produce are highly engineered materials for demanding applications. There are less than ten companies producing one or more similar products that we consider our major competitors for our high-value products used in demanding applications, particularly in our Aerospace and Defense and Energy end-use markets. These products are generally required to meet complex customer product specifications and often require the materials to be qualified prior to supplying the customer. Our experience, technical capabilities, product offerings and research and development efforts represent barriers to existing and potential competitors.

For other products, there are several dozen smaller producing companies and converting companies that are also competitors, as well as several hundred independent distributors of products similar to those distributed by us. Additionally, numerous foreign companies produce various specialty metal products similar to those produced by us. Furthermore, a number of different products may, in certain instances, be substituted for our finished products.
(8)                Research, Product and Process Development:

Our expenditures for company-sponsored research and development were $23.3 million, $19.3 million and $16.9 million in fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We believe that our ability to be an innovator in special material development and manufacturing processes has been and will continue to be an important factor in the success of the Company. Our worldwide staff of expert metallurgists, research and development scientists, engineers and service professionals work closely with our customers to identify and provide innovative solutions to specific product requirements.
(9)         Environmental Regulations:

We are subject to various stringent federal, state, local and international environmental laws and regulations relating to pollution, protection of public health and the environment, natural resource damages and occupational safety and health. Management evaluates the liability for future environmental remediation costs on a quarterly basis. We accrue amounts for environmental remediation costs representing management’s best estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable costs relating to environmental remediation. For further information on environmental remediation, see the Contingencies section included in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”.

Our costs of maintaining and operating environmental control equipment were $15.6 million, $13.0 million and $12.4 million for fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The capital expenditures for environmental control equipment were $1.7 million, $1.2 million and $0.8 million for fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We anticipate spending approximately $4 million on major domestic environmental capital projects over the next five fiscal years. This includes approximately $1 million in fiscal year 2020. Due to the possibility of future regulatory developments, the amount of future capital expenditures may vary from these estimates.

(10)         Employees:

As of June 30, 2019, our total workforce consisted of approximately 5,100 employees, which included approximately 150 production employees in Washington, Pennsylvania, who are covered under a collective bargaining agreement which expires on August 31, 2019, and approximately 500 employees in Latrobe, Pennsylvania who are covered under a collective bargaining agreement which expires August 1, 2020. We believe our relations with our employees are generally good.

(d)               Financial information about foreign and domestic operations and export sales:

Sales outside of the United States, including export sales, were $773.5 million, $728.3 million and $599.3 million in fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Long-lived assets held outside of the United States were $30.6 million and $27.0 million as of June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For further information on domestic and international sales, see Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”.
