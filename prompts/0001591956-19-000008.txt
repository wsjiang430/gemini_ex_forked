Discontinued Operations 
On February 20, 2018, the Company, Overland Storage, Inc., a California corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company at such time (“Overland”), and Silicon Valley Technology Partners, Inc. (formerly Silicon Valley Technology Partners LLC) (“SVTP”), a Delaware corporation established by Eric Kelly, the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors, entered into a share purchase agreement (as amended by that certain First Amendment to Share Purchase Agreement dated August 21, 2018, and as further amended by that certain Second Amendment to Share Purchase Agreement dated November 1, 2018, the “Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell to SVTP all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Overland.
On November 13, 2018, pursuant the Purchase Agreement, the Company sold to SVTP all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Overland in consideration for (i) the issuance to the Company of shares of Series A Preferred Stock of SVTP representing 19.9% of the outstanding shares of capital stock of SVTP as of the closing with a value of $2.1 million, (ii) the release of the Company from outstanding debt obligations totaling $41.7 million assumed by SVTP, and (iii) $1.0 million in cash proceeds from SVTP. 
 In connection with the closing of the Purchase Agreement, we filed an articles of amendment to our articles of amalgamation setting forth the rights, privileges, restrictions and conditions of a new series of non-voting preferred shares of the Company (the “Series A Preferred Shares”) and entered into a Conversion Agreement, by and between the Company and FBC Holdings, pursuant to which $6.5 million of the Company’s outstanding secured debt was converted into 6,500,000 Series A redeemable Preferred Shares (the “Preferred Shares”).
The full text of the Purchase Agreement is filed as Exhibit 2.1 to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on February 21, 2018, the full text of the First Amendment to Share Purchase Agreement is filed as Exhibit 2.1 to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on August 21, 2018, and the full text of the Second Amendment to Share Purchase Agreement is filed as Exhibit 2.1 to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on November 2, 2018.
Warrant Exchange Agreement
On March 16, 2018, the Company entered into warrant exchange agreements, in a privately negotiated exchange under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to which the Company issued 178,875 common shares in exchange for the surrender and cancellation of the Company’s outstanding March 24, 2017 warrants (the “Exchange”). Immediately after the Exchange, the previously issued warrants became null and void. MF Ventures, LLC, a related party, participated in the Exchange by acquiring 37,500 common shares in exchange for a warrant to purchase 34,091 common shares.
Reverse Stock Split
On October 24, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a share consolidation (also known as a reverse stock split) of the Company’s issued and outstanding common shares at a ratio of 1-for-8, which became effective on November 5, 2018. All share and per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto have been restated for all periods to reflect the share consolidation.
On July 5, 2017, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a share consolidation (also known as a reverse stock split) of the Company’s issued and outstanding common shares at a ratio of 1-for-25, which became effective on July 11, 2017. All share and per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto have been restated for all periods to reflect the share consolidation.

UCX and HVE Acquisition
In January 2017, we completed our acquisition of all of the outstanding equity interests of UCX and HVE (the “January 2017 acquisition”). UCX and HVE provide information technology consulting services and hardware solutions around cloud computing, data storage and server virtualization to corporate, government, and educational institutions primarily in the southern central United States. By adding UCX’s products, technologies, professional services and engineering talent, and HVE’s engineering and virtualization expertise, we believe we can now focus our efforts on expanding our virtualization offerings as well as enhance our ability to support the delivery of hybrid cloud solutions to customers.
We have included UCX and HVE’s product revenue with our disk systems products. The business activities of UCX and HVE may result in individual transactions that are more significant than those that normally result from our legacy business lines. Those significant transactions may involve multiple elements and may involve circumstances where, based on customer requests, equipment may be delivered either to the end customer location or to a third-party location specified by the customer.

Production
A significant number of our components and finished products are manufactured or assembled, in whole or in part, by a limited number of third parties. For certain products, we control the design process internally and then outsource the manufacturing and assembly in order to achieve lower production costs.
We purchase disk drives and chassis from outside suppliers. We carefully select suppliers based on their ability to provide quality parts and components which meet technical specifications and volume requirements. We actively monitor these suppliers but we are subject to substantial risks associated with the performance of our suppliers. For certain components, we qualify only a single source, which magnifies the risk of shortages and may decrease our ability to negotiate with that supplier. For a more detailed description of risks related to suppliers, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Sales and Distribution

• | Distribution channel - We have distribution partners in North America. We sell through a two-tier distribution model where distributors sell our products to system integrators, VARs or DMRs, who in turn sell to end users. We support these distribution partners through our dedicated sales force and engineers. In 2018, two distribution partners accounted for, in the aggregate, 25.4% of net revenue.


• | Reseller channel - Our worldwide reseller channel includes systems integrators, VARs and DMRs. Our resellers may package our products as part of complete application and desktop virtualization solutions data processing systems or with other storage devices to deliver complete enterprise information technology infrastructure solutions. Our resellers also recommend our products as replacement solutions when systems are upgraded, or bundle our products with storage management software specific to the end user’s system. We support the reseller channel through our dedicated sales representatives, engineers and technical support organizations.


• | Cloud Marketplace - Since 2015, we have utilized the Microsoft Azure Cloud Marketplace as an additional channel for our cloud solutions to sell to end-users directly with the pay-per-use model, supported through the Microsoft Azure Cloud.

Patents and Proprietary Rights 
We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secret and copyright laws, as well as contractual restrictions, to protect the proprietary aspects of our products and services. Although every effort is made to protect Sphere 3D’s intellectual property, these legal protections may only afford limited protection. 
5

We may continue to file for patents regarding various aspects of our products, services and delivery method at a later date depending on the costs and timing associated with such filings. We may make investments to further strengthen our copyright protection going forward, although no assurances can be given that it will be successful in such patent and trademark protection endeavors. We seek to limit disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees, consultants, and partners with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements and non-competition agreements (when applicable) and by restricting access to our proprietary information. Due to rapid technological change, we believe that establishing and maintaining an industry and technology advantage in factors such as the expertise and technological and creative skills of our personnel, as well as new services and enhancements to our existing services, are more important to our company’s business and profitability than other available legal protections.
Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. The laws of many countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. or Canada. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement. Any such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. There can be no assurance that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar services or products. Any failure by us to adequately protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. See Item 1A. Risk Factors under the section Risks Related to Intellectual Property.
Competitive Conditions 
We believe that our products are unique and innovative and afford us various advantages in the market place; however, the market for information technology is highly competitive. Competitors vary in size from small start-ups to large multi-national corporations which may have substantially greater financial, research and development, and marketing resources. Competitive factors in these markets include performance, functionality, scalability, availability, interoperability, connectivity, time to market enhancements, and total cost of ownership. Barriers to entry vary from low, such as those in traditional disk-based backup products, to high, in virtualization software. The markets for all of our products are characterized by price competition and as such we may face price pressure for our products. For a more detailed description of competitive and other risks related to our business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Employees
The Company had 41 employees at December 31, 2018.

1A. Risk Factors
An investment in our Company involves a high degree of risk. Each of the following risk factors in evaluating our business and prospects as well as an investment in our Company should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business and financial results could be harmed and the trading price of our common shares could decline.
Risks Related to our Business
Our cash and other sources of liquidity will not be sufficient to fund our operations beyond May 31, 2019. We may not be successful in raising additional capital necessary to meet expected increases in working capital needs. If we raise additional funding through sales of equity or equity-based securities, your shares will be diluted. If we need additional funding for operations and we are unable to raise it, we may be forced to liquidate assets and/or curtail or cease operations or seek bankruptcy protection or be subject to an involuntary bankruptcy petition.
Management has projected that cash on hand will not be sufficient to allow the Company to continue operations beyond May 31, 2019 if we are unable to raise additional funding for operations. We expect our working capital needs to increase in the future as we continue to expand and enhance our operations. Our ability to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other sources may depend on the financial success of our current business and successful implementation of our key strategic initiatives, financial, economic and market conditions and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. No assurance can be given that we will be successful in raising the required capital at reasonable cost and at the required times, or at all. Further equity financings may have a dilutive effect on shareholders and any debt financing, if available, may require restrictions to be placed on our future financing and operating activities. If we require additional capital and are unsuccessful in raising that capital, we may not be able to continue our business operations and advance our growth initiatives, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Significant changes from the Company’s current forecasts, including but not limited to: (i) failure to comply with the financial covenants in its debt facilities; (ii) shortfalls from projected sales levels; (iii) unexpected increases in product costs; (iv) increases in operating costs; (v) changes in the historical timing of collecting accounts receivable; and (vi) inability to maintain compliance with the requirements of the NASDAQ Capital Market and/or inability to maintain listing with the NASDAQ Capital Market could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s ability to access the level of funding necessary to continue its operations at current levels. If any of these events occurs or the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash from operations or financing sources, the Company may be forced to liquidate assets where possible and/or curtail, suspend or cease planned programs or operations generally or seek bankruptcy protection or be subject to an involuntary bankruptcy petition, any of, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity.
If we raise additional funds by selling additional shares of our capital stock, or securities convertible into shares of our capital stock, the ownership interest of our existing shareholders will be diluted. The amount of dilution could be increased by the issuance of warrants or securities with other dilutive characteristics, such as anti-dilution clauses or price resets.
We urge you to review the additional information about our liquidity and capital resources in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section of this report. If our business ceases to continue as a going concern due to lack of available capital or otherwise, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.
7

We have granted security interests over certain of our assets in connection with various debt arrangements.
We have granted security interests over certain of our assets in connection with our related party note payable and line of credit, and we may grant additional security interests to secure future borrowings. If we are unable to satisfy our obligations under these arrangements, we could be forced to sell certain assets that secure these loans, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business. In the event we are unable to maintain compliance with covenants set forth in these arrangements or if these arrangements are otherwise terminated for any reason, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to access the level of funding necessary to continue operations at current levels. If any of these events occur, management may be forced to make reductions in spending, extend payment terms with suppliers, liquidate assets where possible, and/or suspend or curtail planned programs. Any of these actions could materially harm our business, results of operations and future prospects.
We face a selling cycle of variable length to secure new purchase agreements for our products and services, and design wins may not result in purchase orders or new customer relationships.
We face a selling cycle of variable lengths to secure new purchase agreements. Even if we succeed in developing a relationship with a potential new customer and/or obtaining design wins, we may not be successful in securing new sales for our products or services, or new customers. In addition, we cannot accurately predict the timing of entering into purchase agreements with new customers due to the complex purchase decision processes of some large institutional customers, such as healthcare providers or school districts, which often involve high-level management or board approvals. Consequently, we have only a limited ability to predict the timing of specific new customer relationships.
We have a history of net losses. We may not achieve or maintain profitability.
We have limited non-recurring revenues derived from operations. Sphere 3D’s near-term focus has been in actively developing reference accounts and building sales, marketing and support capabilities. UCX and HVE, which we acquired in January 2017, also has a history of net losses. We expect to continue to incur net losses and we may not achieve or maintain profitability. We may see continued losses during 2019 and as a result of these and other factors, we may not be able to achieve, sustain or increase profitability in the near future. 
Sphere 3D is subject to many risks common to early-stage enterprises, including under-capitalization, cash shortages, limitations with respect to personnel, financial, and other resources, technology, and market acceptance issues. There is no assurance that we will be successful in achieving a return on shareholders’ investment and the likelihood of success must be considered considering our stage of operations. 
Our plans for growth will place significant demands upon our resources. If we are unsuccessful in achieving our plan for growth, our business could be harmed.
We are actively pursuing a plan to market our products domestically and internationally. The plan will place significant demands upon managerial, financial, and human resources. Our ability to manage future growth will depend in large part upon several factors, including our ability to rapidly:

• | build or leverage, as applicable, a network of channel partners to create an expanding presence in the evolving marketplace for our products and services;


• | build or leverage, as applicable, a sales team to keep end-users and channel partners informed regarding the technical features, issues and key selling points of our products and services;


• | attract and retain qualified technical personnel in order to continue to develop reliable and flexible products and provide services that respond to evolving customer needs;


• | develop support capacity for end-users as sales increase, so that we can provide post-sales support without diverting resources from product development efforts; and


• | expand our internal management and financial controls significantly, so that we can maintain control over our operations and provide support to other functional areas as the number of personnel and size increases.

8

Our inability to achieve any of these objectives could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our market is competitive and dynamic. New competing products and services could be introduced at any time that could result in reduced profit margins and loss of market share.
The technology industry is very dynamic, with new technology and services being introduced by a range of players, from larger established companies to start-ups, on a frequent basis. Our competitors may announce new products, services, or enhancements that better meet the needs of end-users or changing industry standards. Further, new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge. Increased competition may cause price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Furthermore, the worldwide storage market is intensely competitive. A number of manufacturers of disk-based storage solutions compete for a limited number of customers. Barriers to entry are relatively low in these markets, and some of our competitors in this market have substantially greater financial and other resources, larger research and development staffs, and more experience and capabilities in manufacturing, marketing and distributing products. Ongoing pricing pressure could result in significant price erosion, reduced profit margins and loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity.
Our success depends on our ability to anticipate technological changes and develop new and enhanced products.
The markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and increasingly sophisticated customer requirements. The introduction of products embodying new technology and the emergence of new industry standards can negatively impact the marketability of our existing products and can exert price pressures on existing products. It is critical to our success that we are able to anticipate and react quickly to changes in technology or in industry standards and to successfully develop, introduce, manufacture and achieve market acceptance of new, enhanced and competitive products on a timely basis and cost-effective basis. We invest substantial resources towards continued innovation; however, there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop new products or enhance and improve our existing products, that new products and enhanced and improved existing products will achieve market acceptance or that the introduction of new products or enhanced existing products by others will not negatively impact us. Our inability to develop products that are competitive in technology and price and that meet end-user needs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Development schedules for technology products are inherently uncertain. We may not meet our product development schedules, and development costs could exceed budgeted amounts. Our business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity may be materially and adversely affected if the products or product enhancements that we develop are delayed or not delivered due to developmental problems, quality issues or component shortage problems, or if our products or product enhancements do not achieve market acceptance or are unreliable. We or our competitors will continue to introduce products embodying new technologies, such as new sequential or random access mass storage devices. In addition, new industry standards may emerge. Such events could render our existing products obsolete or not marketable, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity.
Our business is dependent on the continued market acceptance and usage of disk-based solutions. The impact of recent storage technology trends on our business is uncertain.
The industry in which we operate has experienced significant historical growth due to the continuing increase in the demand for storage by consumers, enterprises and government bodies around the world. While information technology spending has fluctuated periodically due to technology transitions and changing economic and business environments, overall growth in demand for storage has continued. Recent technology trends, such as the emergence of hosted storage, software as a service and mobile data access are driving significant changes in storage architectures and solution requirements. The impact of these trends on overall long-term growth patterns is uncertain. Nevertheless, if the general level of historic industry growth, or if the growth of the specific markets in which we compete, were to decline, our business and results of operations could suffer.
9

Our management team continually reviews and evaluates our product portfolio, operating structure, and markets to assess the future viability of our existing products and market positions. We may determine that the infrastructure and expenses necessary to sustain an existing product offering are greater than the potential contribution margin that we would realize. As a result, we may determine that it is in our best interest to exit or divest one or more existing product offerings, which could result in costs incurred for exit or disposal activities and/or impairments of long-lived assets. Moreover, if we do not identify other opportunities to replace discontinued products or operations, our revenues would decline, which could lead to further net losses and adversely impact the market price of our common shares.
In addition, we could incur charges for excess and obsolete inventory. The value of our inventory may be adversely affected by factors that affect our ability to sell the products in our inventory. Such factors include changes in technology, introductions of new products by us or our competitors, the current or future economic downturns, or other actions by our competitors. If we do not effectively forecast and manage our inventory, we may need to write off inventory as excess or obsolete, which adversely affects cost of sales and gross profit. Our business has previously experienced, and we may in the future experience, reductions in sales of older generation products as customers delay or defer purchases in anticipation of new products that we or our competitors may introduce. We have established reserves for slow moving or obsolete inventory. These reserves, however, may prove to be inadequate, which would result in additional charges for excess or obsolete inventory.
Our products may contain defects in components or design, and our warranty reserves may not adequately cover our warranty obligations for these products.
Although we employ a vigorous testing and quality assurance program, our products may contain defects or errors, particularly when first introduced or as new versions are released. We may not discover such defects or errors until after a solution has been released to a customer and used by the customer and end-users. Defects and errors in our products could materially and adversely affect our reputation, result in significant costs, delay planned release dates and impair our ability to sell our products in the future. The costs incurred in correcting any solution defects or errors may be substantial and could adversely affect our operating margins. While we plan to continually test our products for defects and errors and work with end-users through our post-sales support services to identify and correct defects and errors, defects or errors in our products may be found in the future.
We have also established reserves for the estimated liability associated with product warranties. However, we could experience unforeseen circumstances where these or future reserves may not adequately cover our warranty obligations. For example, the failure or inadequate performance of product components that we purchase could increase our warranty obligations beyond these reserves.
The failure to attract, hire, retain and motivate key personnel could have a significant adverse impact on our operations. 
Our success depends on the retention and maintenance of key personnel, including members of senior management and our technical, sales and marketing teams. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including competition for such highly skilled personnel; fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions; changes in our management or leadership; competitors’ hiring practices; and the effectiveness of our compensation programs. The loss of any of these key persons could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. As an example, in the first quarter of 2019, our financial controller, and certain other members of our finance team, resigned from employment to seek other opportunities, which has required us to retain finance consultants while we search for full-time replacements, and we cannot guaranty that we will be able to retain such consultants or find adequate replacements. 
Our success is also dependent on our continuing ability to identify, hire, train, motivate and retain highly qualified management, technical, sales, marketing and finance personnel. Any such new hire may require a significant transition period prior to making a meaningful contribution. Competition for qualified employees is particularly intense in the technology industry, and we have in the past experienced difficulty recruiting qualified employees. Our failure to attract and to retain the necessary qualified personnel could seriously harm our operating results and financial condition. Competition for such personnel can be intense, and no assurance can be provided that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel in the future, which may have a material adverse effect on our future growth and profitability. We do not have key person insurance.
10

Our financial results may fluctuate substantially for many reasons, and past results should not be relied on as indications of future performance. 
Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and from year to year due to a combination of factors, including, but not limited to: 

• | varying size, timing and contractual terms of orders for our products, which may delay the recognition of revenue;


• | competitive conditions in the industry, including strategic initiatives by us or our competitors, new products or services, product or service announcements and changes in pricing policy by us or our competitors;


• | market acceptance of our products and services;


• | our ability to maintain existing relationships and to create new relationships with channel partners;


• | the discretionary nature of purchase and budget cycles of our customers and end-users;


• | the length and variability of the sales cycles for our products;


• | general weakening of the economy resulting in a decrease in the overall demand for our products and services or otherwise affecting the capital investment levels of businesses with respect to our products or services;


• | timing of product development and new product initiatives;


• | changes in customer mix;


• | increases in the cost of, or limitations on, the availability of materials;


• | fluctuations in average selling prices;


• | changes in product mix; and


• | increases in costs and expenses associated with the introduction of new products.

Further, the markets that we serve are volatile and subject to market shifts that we may be unable to anticipate. A slowdown in the demand for workstations, mid-range computer systems, networks and servers could have a significant adverse effect on the demand for our products in any given period. In the past, we have experienced delays in the receipt of purchase orders and, on occasion, anticipated purchase orders have been rescheduled or have not materialized due to changes in customer requirements. Our customers may cancel or delay purchase orders for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, the rescheduling of new product introductions, changes in our customers’ inventory practices or forecasted demand, general economic conditions affecting our customers’ markets, changes in our pricing or the pricing of our competitors, new product announcements by us or others, quality or reliability problems related to our products, or selection of competitive products as alternate sources of supply.
Thus, there can be no assurance that we will be able to reach profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. We believe that our revenue and operating results will continue to fluctuate, and that period-to-period comparisons are not necessarily indications of future performance. Our revenue and operating results may fail to meet the expectations of public market analysts or investors, which could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common shares. In addition, portions of our expenses are fixed and difficult to reduce if our revenues do not meet our expectations. These fixed expenses magnify the adverse effect of any revenue shortfall.
Our plans for implementing our business strategy and achieving profitability are based upon the experience, judgment and assumptions of our key management personnel, and available information concerning the communications and technology industries. If management’s assumptions prove to be incorrect, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
11

We rely on indirect sales channels to market and sell our branded products. Therefore, the loss of, or deterioration in, our relationship with one or more of our distributors or resellers could negatively affect our operating results.
We have relationships with third party resellers, OEMs, system integrators and enterprise application providers that facilitate our ability to sell and implement our products. These business relationships are important to extend the geographic reach and customer penetration of our sales force and ensure that our products are compatible with customer network infrastructures and with third party products. 
We believe that our success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and maintain strategic relationships with resellers, independent software vendors, OEMs, system integrators, and enterprise application providers. Should any of these third parties go out of business, or choose not to work with us, we may be forced to increase the development of those capabilities internally, incurring significant expense and adversely affecting operating margins. Any of these third parties may develop relationships with other companies, including those that develop and sell products that compete with ours. We could lose sales opportunities if we fail to work effectively with these parties or they choose not to work with us. Most of our distributors and resellers also carry competing product lines that they may promote over our products. A distributor or reseller might not continue to purchase our products or market them effectively, and each determines the type and amount of our products that it will purchase from us and the pricing of the products that it sells to end user customers. Further, the long-term success of any of our distributors or resellers is difficult to predict, and we have no purchase commitments or long-term orders from any of them to assure us of any baseline sales through these channels. 
Therefore, the loss of, or deterioration in, our relationship with one or more of our distributors or resellers could negatively affect our operating results. Our operating results could also be adversely affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to:

• | a change in competitive strategy that adversely affects a distributor’s or reseller’s willingness or ability to stock and distribute our products;


• | the reduction, delay or cancellation of orders or the return of a significant amount of our products;


• | the loss of one or more of our distributors or resellers; and


• | any financial difficulties of our distributors or resellers that result in their inability to pay amounts owed to us.

If our suppliers fail to meet our manufacturing needs, it would delay our production and our product shipments to customers and this could negatively affect our operations. 
Some of our products have a large number of components and subassemblies produced by outside suppliers. We depend greatly on these suppliers for items that are essential to the manufacture of our products, including disk drives and chassis. We work closely with our regional, national and international suppliers, which are carefully selected based on their ability to provide quality parts and components that meet both our technical specifications and volume requirements. For certain items, we qualify only a single source, which magnifies the risk of shortages and decreases our ability to negotiate with that supplier on the basis of price. From time to time, we have in the past been unable to obtain as many drives as have needed due to drive shortages or quality issues from certain of our suppliers. If these suppliers fail to meet our manufacturing needs, it would delay our production and our product shipments to customers and negatively affect our operations.
We are subject to laws, regulations and similar requirements, changes to which may adversely affect our business and operations. 
We are subject to laws, regulations and similar requirements that affect our business and operations, including, but not limited to, the areas of commerce, intellectual property, income and other taxes, labor, environmental, health and safety, and our compliance in these areas may be costly. While we have implemented policies and procedures to comply with laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies. Any such violation or alleged violation could materially and adversely affect our business. Any changes or potential changes to laws, regulations or similar requirements, or our ability to respond to these changes, may significantly increase our 
12

costs to maintain compliance or result in our decision to limit our business or products, which could materially harm our business, results of operations and future prospects.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act includes provisions regarding certain minerals and metals, known as conflict minerals, mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. These provisions require companies to undertake due diligence procedures and report on the use of conflict minerals in its products, including products manufactured by third parties. Compliance with these provisions will cause us to incur costs to certify that our supply chain is conflict free and we may face difficulties if our suppliers are unwilling or unable to verify the source of their materials. Our ability to source these minerals and metals may also be adversely impacted. In addition, our customers may require that we provide them with a certification and our inability to do so may disqualify us as a supplier.
We have made a number of acquisitions in the past and we may make acquisitions in the future. Our ability to identify complementary assets, products or businesses for acquisition and successfully integrate them could affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
In the future, we may continue to pursue acquisitions of assets, products or businesses that we believe are complementary to our existing business and/or to enhance our market position or expand our product portfolio. There is a risk that we will not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates available for sale at reasonable prices, complete any acquisition, or successfully integrate any acquired product or business into our operations. We are likely to face competition for acquisition candidates from other parties including those that have substantially greater available resources. Acquisitions may involve a number of other risks, including:

• | diversion of management’s attention;


• | disruption to our ongoing business;


• | failure to retain key acquired personnel;


• | difficulties in integrating acquired operations, technologies, products or personnel;


• | unanticipated expenses, events or circumstances;


• | assumption of disclosed and undisclosed liabilities; and


• | inappropriate valuation of the acquired in-process research and development, or the entire acquired business.

If we do not successfully address these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with an acquisition, the acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Problems with an acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our performance or our business as a whole. In addition, if we proceed with an acquisition, our available cash may be used to complete the transaction, diminishing our liquidity and capital resources, or shares may be issued which could cause significant dilution to existing shareholders.
We have implemented cost reduction efforts. We may need to implement additional cost reduction efforts, which could materially harm our business. 
We have implemented certain cost reduction efforts. There can be no assurance that these cost reduction efforts will be successful. As a result, we may need to implement further cost reduction efforts across our operations, such as further reductions in the cost of our workforce and/or suspending or curtailing planned programs, either of which could materially harm our business, results of operations and future prospects.

Risks Related to Intellectual Property
Our ability to compete depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights. 
Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our rights in our intellectual property. We rely on various intellectual property protections, including copyright, trade-mark and trade secret laws and contractual provisions, to preserve our intellectual property rights. We have filed a number of patent applications and have historically protected our intellectual property through trade secrets and copyrights. As our technology is evolving and rapidly changing, current intellectual property rights may not adequately protect us.
Intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from developing products that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products. Competitors may independently develop similar products, duplicate our products or, if patents are issued to us, design around these patents. To the extent that we have or obtain patents, such patents may not afford meaningful protection for our technology and products. Others may challenge our patents and, as a result, our patents could be narrowed, invalidated or declared unenforceable. The patents that are material to our business began expiring in November 2015. In addition, our current or future patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents in the U.S. or foreign countries. 
Although we believe we have a proprietary platform for our technologies and products, we may in the future become subject to claims for infringement of intellectual property rights owned by others. Further, to protect our own intellectual property rights, we may in the future bring claims for infringement against others. 
Our commercial success depends, in part, upon not infringing intellectual property rights owned by others. Although we believe that we have a proprietary platform for our technologies and products, we cannot determine with certainty whether any existing third party patents or the issuance of any third party patents would require us to alter our technology, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. We may become subject to claims by third parties that our technology infringes their intellectual property rights. While we provide our customers with a qualified indemnity against the infringement of third party intellectual property rights, we may become subject to these claims either directly or through indemnities against these claims that we routinely provide to our end-users and channel partners. 
Further, our customers may use our products in ways that may infringe the intellectual property rights or third parties and/or require a license from third parties. Although our customers are contractually obligated to use our products only in a manner that does not infringe third party intellectual property rights, we cannot guarantee that such third parties will not seek remedies against us for providing products that may enable our customers to infringe the intellectual property rights of others.
In addition, we may receive in the future, claims from third parties asserting infringement, claims based on indemnities provided by us, and other related claims. Litigation may be necessary to determine the scope, enforceability and validity of third party proprietary or other rights, or to establish our proprietary or other rights. Furthermore, despite precautions, it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use our intellectual property without our authorization. Policing unauthorized use of intellectual property is difficult, and some foreign laws do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of Canada or the U.S. To protect our intellectual property, we may become involved in litigation. In addition, other companies may initiate similar proceedings against us. The patent position of information technology firms is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions, and continues to be the subject of much litigation. No consistent policy has emerged from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or the courts regarding the breadth of claims allowed or the degree of protection afforded under information technology patents.
Some of our competitors have, or are affiliated with companies having, substantially greater resources than us and these competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation to a greater degree and for a longer period of time than us. Regardless of their merit, any such claims could: 

• | divert the attention of our management, cause significant delays, materially disrupt the conduct of our business or materially adversely affect our revenue, financial condition and results of operations;


• | be time consuming to evaluate and defend;

14


• | result in costly litigation and substantial expenses;


• | cause product shipment delays or stoppages;


• | subject us to significant liabilities;


• | require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements;


• | require us to modify or stop using the infringing technology; or


• | result in costs or other consequences that have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Risks Related to Our Public Company Status and Our Common Shares
If our common shares are delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market, our business, financial condition, results of operations and share price could be adversely affected, and the liquidity of our common shares and our ability to obtain financing could be impaired. 
On November 12, 2018, we received a letter from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC notifying us that we were not in compliance with the requirement of Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5550(b)(1) for continued inclusion on the NASDAQ Capital Market because the Company’s stockholders’ equity of $707,000 reported in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2018, is below the required minimum of $2.5 million. This notification has no effect on the listing of the Company’s common shares at this time. In accordance with Nasdaq listing rules, the Company had 45 calendar days, or until December 27, 2018, to submit a plan to regain compliance, which plan was timely submitted by the Company and was accepted by Nasdaq on January 11, 2019. If the Company does not regain compliance by May 13, 2019, or if the Company fails to satisfy another Nasdaq requirement for continued listing, Nasdaq staff could provide notice that the Company’s common shares will become subject to delisting. In such event, Nasdaq rules permit the Company to appeal any delisting determination to a Nasdaq Hearings Panel. Accordingly, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to maintain its Nasdaq listing. Such notice, or the actual delisting of our shares, could materially and adversely affect our business by, among other things, making it more difficult to access additional capital from investors who prefer to purchase shares listed on an actively traded market, and may cause investors to find our common shares less attractive, either of which could result in a less active trading market for our common shares and make our share price more volatile.
We have in the past failed to comply with the minimum $1.00 per share closing bid price requirement for continued listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market. Maintaining the listing of our common shares on the NASDAQ Capital Market requires that we comply with the closing bid price requirement, amongst other certain listing requirements. If our common shares cease to be listed for trading on NASDAQ for any reason, it may harm our share price, increase the volatility of our share price, decrease the level of trading activity and make it more difficult for investors to buy or sell shares of our common shares. Our failure to maintain a listing on NASDAQ may constitute an event of default under our outstanding indebtedness as well as any future indebtedness, which would accelerate the maturity date of such debt or trigger other obligations. In addition, certain institutional investors that are not permitted to own securities of non-listed companies may be required to sell their shares, which would adversely affect the trading price of our common shares. If we are not listed on NASDAQ, we will be limited in our ability to raise additional capital we may need.
On May 29, 2018, we received a letter from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC notifying us that we were not in compliance with the requirement of Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5550(a)(2) for continued inclusion on the NASDAQ Capital Market as a result of the closing bid price for the Company’s common stock being below $1.00 for 30 consecutive business days. On October 31, 2018, the Company held a special meeting and passed a special resolution authorizing the filing of an amendment to the Company's articles to effect a share consolidation (also known as a reverse stock split). On October 24, 2018, the Board of Directors authorized a share consolidation (also known as a reverse stock split) of the Company’s issued and outstanding common shares at a ratio of one-for-eight, which became effective on November 5, 2018. On November 20, 2018, we received a letter from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications department of Nasdaq noting that the Company had regained compliance with the requirement of Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5550(a)(2).

Sales of common shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants, the conversion of outstanding preferred shares, or the effectiveness of our registration statement may cause the market price of our common shares to decline. Currently outstanding preferred shares could adversely affect the rights of the holders of common shares. 
As of December 31, 2018, we have 6,500,000 Preferred Shares outstanding. The conversion of these outstanding Preferred Shares will result in substantial dilution to our common shareholders. Pursuant to our articles of amalgamation, the Board has the authority to fix and determine the voting rights, rights of redemption and other rights and preferences of preferred stock. Pursuant to the articles of amendment governing the rights and preferences of outstanding shares of Preferred Shares, each preferred share (i) subject to prior shareholder approval, are convertible into our common shares, at a conversion rate equal to $1.00 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends, divided by an amount equal to 0.85 multiplied by a 15-day volume weighted average price per Common Share prior to the date the conversion notice is provided, subject to a conversion price floor of $0.80, (ii) carry a cumulative preferred dividend at a rate of 8.0% of the subscription price per Series A Preferred Share, (iii) are subject to mandatory redemption for cash at the option of the holders thereof after a two-year period, and (iv) carry a liquidation preference equal to the subscription price per Series A Preferred Share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends. Additionally, as of December 31, 2018 we have warrants outstanding for the purchase of up to 208,187 common shares having a weighted-average exercise price of $41.15 per share. The sale of our common shares upon exercise of our outstanding warrants, the conversion of the Preferred Shares into common shares, or the sale of a significant amount of the common shares issued or issuable upon exercise of the warrants in the open market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common shares to decline or become highly volatile.
Future sales of our securities under certain circumstances may trigger price-protection provisions in outstanding warrants, which would dilute your investment and could result in a decline in the trading price of our common shares. 
In connection with our registered direct offering in December 2015, we issued a warrant exercisable to purchase up to 7,500 common shares that contains certain price protection provisions. If we, at any time while these warrants are outstanding, effect certain variable rate transactions and the issue price, conversion price or exercise price per share applicable thereto is less than the exercise price then in effect for the warrants, then the exercise price of the warrants will be reduced to equal such price. The triggering of these price protection provisions, together with the exercise of these warrants, could cause additional dilution to our shareholders.
The market price of our common shares is volatile.
The market price for common shares may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:

• | price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;


• | volatility in the market prices and trading volumes of technology stocks;


• | changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;


• | future capital raising activities;


• | sales of common shares by holders thereof or by us;


• | failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of Sphere 3D, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts who follow Sphere 3D, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;


• | the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections or our failure to meet those projections;


• | market acceptance of our products and technologies;


• | announcements by us or our competitors of new products or services;

16


• | the public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC and the applicable Canadian securities regulatory authorities;


• | rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;


• | actual or anticipated changes in our operating results or fluctuations in our operating results;


• | actual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses or the competitive landscape generally;


• | litigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;


• | developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;


• | announced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies by us or our competitors;


• | new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to us and our business;


• | changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations or principles;


• | any significant change in our executive officers and other key personnel or Board of Directors;


• | general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets;


• | release of transfer restrictions on certain outstanding common shares; and


• | news reports relating to trends, concerns or competitive developments, regulatory changes and other related issues in our industry or target markets.

Financial markets may experience price and volume fluctuations that affect the market prices of equity securities of companies and that are unrelated to the operating performance, underlying asset values or prospects of such companies. Accordingly, the market price of the common shares may decline even if our operating results, underlying asset values or prospects have not changed. As well, certain institutional investors may base their investment decisions on consideration of our governance and social practices and performance against such institutions’ respective investment guidelines and criteria, and failure to meet such criteria may result in a limited or no investment in our common shares by those institutions, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common shares. There can be no assurance that fluctuations in price and volume will not occur due to these and other factors.
In the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may in the future be a target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management’s attention from day-to-day operations and consume resources, such as cash. In addition, the resolution of those matters may require us to issue additional common shares, which could potentially result in dilution to our existing shareholders. Expenses incurred in connection with these matters (which include fees of lawyers and other professional advisors and potential obligations to indemnify officers and directors who may be parties to such actions) could adversely affect our cash position. See Item 18 “Financial Statements”, Note 16 “Commitments and Contingencies”.
We must comply with the financial reporting requirements of a public company, as well as other requirements associated with being listed on NASDAQ.
Sphere 3D is subject to reporting and other obligations under applicable Canadian securities laws, SEC rules and the rules of the NASDAQ Capital Market. These reporting and other obligations, including National Instrument 52-102 - Continuous Disclosure Obligations and National Instrument 52-109 - Certification of Disclosure in Issuers’ Annual and Interim Filings, place significant demands on our management, administrative, operational and accounting resources. Moreover, any failure to maintain effective internal controls could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results could be materially harmed, which could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could result in a lower trading price of our common shares.
17

Management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and implemented, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues within a company are detected. The inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Controls can also be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. Due to the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error, or fraud may occur and not be detected.
Sphere 3D is an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (“JOBS”) Act, enacted on April 5, 2012, and Sphere 3D will continue to qualify as an “emerging growth company” until the earliest to occur of: (a) the last day of the fiscal year during which Sphere 3D has total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more; (b) the last day of the fiscal year of Sphere 3D following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities of Sphere 3D pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act; (c) the date on which Sphere 3D has, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt; or (d) the date on which Sphere 3D is deemed to be a ‘large accelerated filer’. 
For so long as Sphere 3D continues to qualify as an emerging growth company, it will be exempt from the requirement to include an auditor attestation report relating to internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“SOA”) in its annual reports filed under the Exchange Act, even if it does not qualify as a “smaller reporting company”. In addition, section 103(a)(3) of the SOA has been amended by the JOBS Act to provide that, among other things, auditors of an emerging growth company are exempt from any rules of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring a supplement to the auditor’s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the registrant (auditor discussion and analysis).
Sphere 3D is and will remain through December 31, 2019, an “emerging growth company” within the meaning under the JOBS Act, and until Sphere 3D ceases to be an emerging growth company Sphere 3D may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the SOA. Investors may find our common shares less attractive because Sphere 3D relies on these exemptions. If some investors find our common shares less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common shares and our share price may be more volatile.
We may be treated as a Passive Foreign Investment Company.
There is also an ongoing risk that Sphere 3D may be treated as a Passive Foreign Investment Company, or PFIC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A non-U.S. corporation generally will be considered to be a PFIC for any taxable year in which 75% or more of its gross income is passive income, or 50% or more of the average value of its assets are considered “passive assets” (generally, assets that generate passive income). This determination is highly factual, and will depend upon, among other things, Sphere 3D’s market valuation and future financial performance. Sphere 3D believes that it was classified as a PFIC during the tax year ended December 31, 2013. However, based on current business plans and financial expectations, Sphere 3D expects that it will not be a PFIC for its current tax years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, as well as current business plans and financial expectations, Sphere 3D expects that it will not be a PFIC for its current tax year ending December 31, 2019 and for the foreseeable future. If Sphere 3D were to be classified as a PFIC for any future taxable year, holders of Sphere 3D common shares who are U.S. taxpayers would be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences.
18

Certain of our directors, officers and management could be in a position of conflict of interest. 
Certain of the directors, officers and members of management of Sphere 3D may also serve as directors and/or officers of other companies. We may contract with such directors, officers, members of management and such other companies or with affiliated parties or other companies in which such directors, officers or members of management own or control. These persons may obtain compensation and other benefits in transactions relating to Sphere 3D. Consequently, there exists the possibility for such directors, officers and members of management to be in a position of conflict. Any decision made by any of such directors, officers and members of management involving Sphere 3D are being made in accordance with their duties and obligations to deal fairly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of Sphere 3D.
Future sales of common shares by directors, officers and other shareholders could adversely affect the prevailing market price for common shares.
Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, officers, directors and other shareholders and their respective affiliates may sell some or all of their common shares in the future. No prediction can be made as to the effect, if any, such future sales will have on the market price of the common shares prevailing from time to time. However, the future sale of a substantial number of common shares by Sphere 3D’s officers, directors and other shareholders and their respective affiliates, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for the common shares.
We may issue an unlimited number of common shares. Future sales of common shares will dilute your shares.
Sphere 3D’s articles permit the issuance of an unlimited number of common shares, and shareholders will have no pre-emptive rights in connection with such further issuances. The directors of Sphere 3D have the discretion to determine the price and the terms of issue of further issuances of common shares in accordance with applicable laws.
