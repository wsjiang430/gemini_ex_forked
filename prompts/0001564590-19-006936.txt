Business Strategy
 Our business strategy has been to maintain a community bank philosophy, which consists of focusing on and understanding the individualized banking and other financial services needs of individuals, municipalities and businesses of the local communities surrounding our primary service area. We believe this focus allows us to be more responsive to our customers’ needs and provide a high level of personal service that differentiates us from larger competitors, resulting in long-standing and broad-based banking relationships. Our core customers are primarily small- to medium-sized businesses, individuals and community organizations who prefer to build banking, insurance and wealth management relationships with a community bank that offers high quality, competitively-priced products and services with personalized service. Because of our identity and origin as a locally operated bank, we believe that our level of personal service provides a competitive advantage over larger banks, which tend to consolidate decision-making authority outside local communities.
 A key aspect of our current business strategy is to foster a community-oriented culture where our customers and employees establish long-standing and mutually beneficial relationships. We believe that we are well-positioned to be a strong competitor within our market area because of our focus on community banking needs and customer service, our comprehensive suite of deposit, loan, insurance and wealth management products typically found at larger banks, our highly experienced management team and our strategically located banking centers. We have evolved to meet changing customer needs by opening what we refer to as financial solution center branches. These financial solution centers have a smaller footprint than our traditional branches, focus on technology to provide solutions that fit our customer preferences for transacting business with us, and these branches are staffed by certified personal bankers who are trained to meet a broad array of customer needs. In recent years, we have opened four financial solution centers in the Rochester and Buffalo markets. We believe that the foregoing factors all help to grow our core deposits, which supports a central element of our business strategy - the growth of a diversified and high-quality loan portfolio.

Acquisition Strategy
 We will continue to explore market expansion opportunities in or near our current market areas as opportunities arise. Our primary focus will be on increasing market share within existing markets, while taking advantage of potential growth opportunities within our insurance and wealth management lines of business by acquiring new businesses that can be added to existing operations. We believe our capital position remains strong enough to support an active merger and acquisition strategy, and expansion of our core financial service businesses of banking, insurance and wealth management. Consequently, we continue to explore acquisition opportunities in these activities. In evaluating acquisition opportunities, we will balance the potential for earnings accretion with maintaining adequate capital levels, which could result in our common stock being the predominant form of consideration and/or the need for us to raise capital.
 Conversations with potential strategic partners occur on a regular basis. The evaluation of any potential opportunity will favor a transaction that complements our core competencies and strategic intent, with a lesser emphasis being placed on geographic location or size. Additionally, we remain committed to maintaining a diversified revenue stream. Our senior management team has experience in acquisitions and post-acquisition integration of operations and is prepared to act quickly should a potential opportunity arise but will remain disciplined with its approach. We believe this experience positions us to successfully acquire and integrate additional financial services and banking businesses.
 MARKET AREAS AND COMPETITION
 We provide a wide range of banking and financial services to individuals, municipalities and businesses through a network of over 50 offices and an extensive ATM network throughout Western and Central New York. The region includes the counties of Allegany, Cattaraugus, Cayuga, Chautauqua, Chemung, Erie, Genesee, Livingston, Monroe, Ontario, Orleans, Schuyler, Seneca, Steuben, Wayne, Wyoming and Yates counties. Our banking activities, though concentrated in the communities where we maintain branches, also extend into neighboring counties. In addition, our consumer indirect lending presence includes the Capital District of New York and Northern and Central Pennsylvania.
 Our market area is economically diversified in that we serve both rural markets and the larger markets in and around Rochester and Buffalo. Rochester and Buffalo are the two largest metropolitan areas in New York outside of New York City, with a combined population of over two million people. We anticipate continuing to increase our presence in and around these metropolitan statistical areas in the coming years.
 We face significant competition in both making loans and attracting deposits, as Western and Central New York have a high density of financial institutions. Our competition for loans comes principally from commercial banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking companies, credit unions, insurance companies and other financial services companies. Our most direct competition for deposits has historically come from commercial banks, savings banks and credit unions. We face additional competition for deposits from non-depository competitors such as the mutual fund industry, securities and brokerage firms and insurance companies. We generally compete with other financial service providers on factors such as level of customer service, responsiveness to customer needs, availability and pricing of products, and geographic location. Our industry frequently experiences merger activity, which affects competition by eliminating some institutions while potentially strengthening the franchises of others.

INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES
 Our investment policy is contained within our overall Asset-Liability Management and Investment Policy. This policy dictates that investment decisions will be made based on the safety of the investment, liquidity requirements, potential returns, cash flow targets, need for collateral and desired risk parameters. In pursuing these objectives, we consider the ability of an investment to provide earnings consistent with factors related to quality, maturity, marketability, pledgeable nature and risk diversification. Our Treasurer, guided by our Asset-Liability Committee (“ALCO”), is responsible for investment portfolio decisions within the established policies.
 Our investment securities strategy is focused on providing liquidity to meet loan demand and redeeming liabilities, meeting pledging requirements, managing credit risks, managing overall interest rate risks and maximizing portfolio yield. Our current policy generally limits security purchases to the following:
  
• | U.S. treasury securities;
--+--------------------------


• | U.S. government agency securities, which are securities issued by official Federal government bodies (e.g., the Government National Mortgage Association (“GNMA”) and the Small Business Administration (“SBA”)), and U.S. government-sponsored enterprise securities, which are securities issued by independent organizations that are in part sponsored by the federal government (e.g., the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) system, the Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA”), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“FHLMC”) and the Federal Farm Credit Bureau);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LENDING ACTIVITIES
 General
 We offer a broad range of loans including commercial business and revolving lines of credit, commercial mortgages, equipment loans, residential mortgage loans and home equity loans and lines of credit, home improvement loans, automobile loans and personal loans. Newly originated and refinanced fixed rate residential mortgage loans are either retained in our portfolio or sold to the secondary market with servicing rights retained.
 We continually evaluate and update our lending policy. The key elements of our lending philosophy include the following:
  
• | To ensure consistent underwriting, employees must share a common view of the risks inherent in lending activities as well as the standards to be applied in underwriting and managing credit risk;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pricing of credit products should be risk-based;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | The loan portfolio must be diversified to limit the potential impact of negative events; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Careful, timely exposure monitoring through dynamic use of our risk rating system is required to provide early warning and assure proactive management of potential problems.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Commercial Business and Commercial Mortgage Lending
 We primarily originate commercial business loans in our market areas and underwrite them based on the borrower’s ability to service the loan from operating income. We offer a broad range of commercial lending products, including term loans and lines of credit. Short and medium-term commercial loans, primarily collateralized, are made available to businesses for working capital (including inventory and receivables), business expansion (including acquisition of real estate, expansion and improvements) and the purchase of equipment. We offer commercial business loans to customers in the agricultural industry for short-term crop production, farm equipment and livestock financing. As a general practice, where possible, a first position collateral lien is placed on any available real estate, equipment or other assets owned by the borrower and a personal guarantee of the owner is obtained. As of December 31, 2018, $162.3 million, or 29%, of our aggregate commercial business loan portfolio were at fixed rates, while $395.6 million, or 71%, were at variable rates.
 We also offer commercial mortgage loans to finance the purchase of real property, which generally consists of real estate with completed structures. Commercial mortgage loans are secured by first liens on the real estate and are typically amortized over a 10 to 20-year period. The underwriting analysis includes credit verification, appraisals and a review of the borrower’s financial condition and repayment capacity. As of December 31, 2018, $584.0 million, or 61%, of the loans in our aggregate commercial mortgage portfolio were at fixed rates, while $374.1 million, or 39%, were at variable rates.
 We utilize government loan guarantee programs where available and appropriate.
 Government Guarantee Programs
 We participate in government loan guarantee programs offered by the SBA, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Rural Economic and Community Development and Farm Service Agency, among others. As of December 31, 2018, we had loans with an aggregate principal balance of $44.7 million that were covered by guarantees under these programs. The guarantees typically only cover a certain percentage of these loans. By participating in these programs, we are able to broaden our base of borrowers while reducing credit risk.
Residential Real Estate Lending
 We originate fixed and variable rate one-to-four family residential mortgages collateralized by owner-occupied properties located in our market areas. We offer a variety of real estate loan products, including home improvement loans, closed-end home equity loans, and home equity lines of credit, which are generally amortized over periods of up to 30 years. Loans collateralized by one-to-four family residential real estate generally have been originated in amounts of no more than 80% of appraised value or have mortgage insurance. Mortgage title insurance and hazard insurance are normally required. We sell certain one-to-four family residential mortgages to the secondary mortgage market and typically retain the right to service the mortgages. We typically follow the underwriting and appraisal guidelines of the secondary market, including the FHLMC and the Federal Housing Administration, and service the loans in a manner that satisfies the secondary market agreements. As of December 31, 2018, our residential mortgage servicing portfolio totaled $171.5 million, the majority of which has been sold to the FHLMC. As of December 31, 2018, our residential real estate loan portfolio totaled $524.2 million, or 17% of our total loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2018, our residential real estate lines portfolio totaled $109.7 million, or 4% of our total loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2018, $452.4 million, or 86%, of the loans in our residential real estate loan portfolio were at fixed rates, while $71.8 million, or 14%, were at variable rates. The residential real estate lines portfolio primarily consists of variable rate lines. Approximately 89% of the loans and lines in our residential real estate portfolios were in first lien positions at December 31, 2018. We do not engage in sub-prime or other high-risk residential mortgage lending as a line-of-business.
 - 8 -


Consumer Lending
 We offer a variety of loan products to our consumer customers, including automobile loans, secured installment loans and other types of secured and unsecured personal loans. At December 31, 2018, outstanding consumer loan balances were concentrated in indirect automobile loans.
 We originate indirect consumer loans for a mix of new and used vehicles through franchised new car dealers. The consumer indirect loan portfolio is primarily comprised of loans with terms that typically range from 36 to 84 months. We have developed relationships with franchised new car dealers in Western, Central and the Capital District of New York, and Northern and Central Pennsylvania. As of December 31, 2018, our consumer indirect portfolio totaled $919.9 million, or 30% of our total loan portfolio. The consumer indirect loan portfolio primarily consists of fixed rate loans with relatively short durations.
 We also originate, independently of the indirect loans described above, consumer automobile loans, recreational vehicle loans, boat loans, personal loans (collateralized and uncollateralized) and deposit account collateralized loans. The terms of these loans typically range from 12 to 60 months and vary based upon the nature of the collateral and the size of loan. A portion of the consumer lending program is underwritten on a secured basis using the customer’s financed automobile, mobile home, boat or recreational vehicle as collateral. The other loans in our consumer portfolio totaled $16.8 million as of December 31, 2018, all of which were fixed rate loans.
 Credit Administration
 Our loan policy establishes standardized underwriting guidelines, as well as the loan approval process and the committee structures necessary to facilitate and ensure the highest possible loan quality decision-making in a timely and businesslike manner. The policy establishes requirements for extending credit based on the size, risk rating and type of credit involved. The policy also sets limits on individual lending authority and various forms of joint lending authority, while designating which loans are required to be approved at the committee level.
 Our credit objectives are to:
  
• | Compete effectively and service the legitimate credit needs of our target market;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enhance our reputation for superior quality and timely delivery of products and services;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Provide pricing that reflects the entire relationship and is commensurate with the risk profiles of our borrowers;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Retain, develop and acquire profitable, multi-product, value added relationships with high quality borrowers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Focus on government guaranteed lending to meet the needs of the small businesses in our communities; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Comply with all relevant laws and regulations.
--+-----------------------------------------------

 Our policy includes loan reviews, under the supervision of our Audit and Risk Oversight committees of the Board of Directors and directed by our Chief Risk Officer, in order to render an independent and objective evaluation of our asset quality and credit administration process.
 We assign risk ratings to loans in the commercial business and commercial mortgage portfolios. We use those risk ratings to:
  
• | Profile the risk and exposure in the loan portfolio and identify developing trends and relative levels of risk;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Identify deteriorating credits;
--+--------------------------------


• | Reflect the probability that a given customer may default on its obligations; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Assist with risk-based pricing.
--+--------------------------------

 Through the loan approval process, loan administration and loan review program, management seeks to continuously monitor our credit risk profile and assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.
 We have several procedures in place to assist in maintaining the overall quality of our loan portfolio. Delinquent loan reports are monitored by credit administration to identify adverse levels and trends. Loans, including impaired loans, are generally classified as non-accruing if they are past due as to maturity or payment of principal or interest for a period of more than 90 days, unless such loans are well-collateralized and in the process of collection. Loans that are on a current payment status or past due less than 90 days may also be classified as non-accruing if repayment in full of principal and/or interest is uncertain.

Allowance for Loan Losses
 The allowance for loan losses is established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses. The allowance reflects management’s estimate of the amount of probable loan losses in the portfolio, based on factors including, but not limited to:

• | Specific allocations for individually analyzed credits;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | Risk assessment process;
--+-------------------------


• | Historical net charge-off experience;
--+--------------------------------------


• | Evaluation of loss emergence and look-back periods;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | Evaluation of the loan portfolio with loan reviews;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | Levels and trends in delinquent and non-accruing loans;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | Trends in volume and terms of loans;
--+-------------------------------------


• | Effects of changes in lending policy;
--+--------------------------------------


• | Experience, ability and depth of management;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | National and local economic trends and conditions;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | Concentrations of credit;
--+--------------------------


• | Interest rate environment;
--+---------------------------


• | Regulatory environment;
--+------------------------


• | Information (availability of timely financial information); and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | Collateral values.
--+-------------------

 Our methodology for estimating the allowance for loan losses includes the following:
  
1. | Impaired commercial business and commercial mortgage loans are typically reviewed individually and assigned a specific loss allowance, if considered necessary, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | The remaining portfolios of commercial business and commercial mortgage loans are segmented by risk rating into the following loan classification categories: uncriticized or pass, special mention, substandard and doubtful. Uncriticized loans, special mention loans, substandard loans and all doubtful loans not assigned a specific loss allowance are assigned allowance allocations based on historical net loan charge-off experience for each of the respective loan categories, supplemented with loss emergence periods and qualitative factors, if considered necessary. These qualitative factors include the levels and trends in delinquent and non-accruing loans, trends in volume and terms of loans, effects of changes in lending policy, experience, ability, and depth of management, national and local economic trends and conditions, concentrations of credit, interest rate environment, regulatory environment, information (availability of timely financial information), and collateral values, among others.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | The retail loan portfolio is segmented into the following types of loans: residential real estate loans, residential real estate lines, consumer indirect and other consumer. Allowance allocations for the retail loan portfolio are based on the average loss experience for the previous eight quarters, supplemented with loss emergence periods and qualitative factors similar to the elements described above.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Management presents a quarterly review of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors based on the methodology described above. See also the section titled “Allowance for Loan Losses” in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 SOURCES OF FUNDS
 Our primary sources of funds are deposits and borrowed funds.
 Deposits
 We maintain a full range of deposit products and accounts to meet the needs of the residents and businesses in our primary service area. Products include an array of checking and savings account programs for individuals and businesses, including money market accounts, certificates of deposit, sweep investment capabilities as well as Individual Retirement Accounts and other qualified plan accounts. We rely primarily on competitive pricing of our deposit products, customer service and long-standing relationships with customers to attract and retain these deposits and seek to make our services convenient to the community by offering a choice of several delivery systems and channels, including telephone, mail, online, automated teller machines (ATMs), debit cards, point-of-sale transactions, automated clearing house transactions (ACH), remote deposit, and mobile banking via telephone or wireless devices. We also take advantage of the use of technology by offering business customers banking access via the Internet and various advanced cash management systems.

- 10 -


We also participate in Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (“CDARS”) and Insured Cash Sweep (“ICS”) programs, which enable depositors to receive FDIC insurance coverage for deposits otherwise exceeding the maximum insurable amount. Through these programs, deposits in excess of the maximum insurable amount are placed with multiple participating financial institutions. Prior to the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (“Economic Growth Act”) enacted on May 14, 2018, all CDARS and ICS deposits were considered brokered deposits for regulatory reporting purposes.  With the enactment of Economic Growth Act, reciprocal CDARS and ICS deposits, subject to certain restrictions, are no longer required to be reported as brokered deposits. CDARS deposits and ICS deposits totaled $224.9 million and $149.6 million, respectively, at December 31, 2018.
 Borrowings
 We have access to a variety of borrowing sources and use both short-term and long-term borrowings to support our asset base. Borrowings from time-to-time include federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, FHLB advances and borrowings from the discount window of the FRB, as defined below.
 Other sources of funds include scheduled amortization and prepayments of principal from loans and mortgage-backed securities, maturities and calls of investment securities and funds provided by operations.
 OTHER INFORMATION
 We also make available, free of charge through our website, all reports filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, as well as any amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after those documents are filed with or furnished to the SEC. These filings may be viewed by accessing the SEC Filings subsection of the Financials section of our website (www.fiiwarsaw.com). Information available on our website is not a part of, and is not incorporated into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 All of the reports we file with the SEC, including this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, as well as any amendments thereto may be accessed at www.sec.gov.
 SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
 We are subject to extensive regulation under federal and state laws. The regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole and not for the protection of shareholders and creditors.
 We are also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as administered by the SEC. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (“Nasdaq”) under the trading symbol “FISI” and is subject to Nasdaq rules for listed companies.
 Significant elements of the laws and regulations applicable to the Company are described below. The description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes, regulations and policies that are described. Also, such statutes, regulations and policies are continually under review by Congress, state legislatures, and federal and state regulatory agencies. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the Company could have a material effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
 Holding Company Regulation. We are subject to comprehensive regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, frequently referred to as the Federal Reserve Board (“FRB” or “Federal Reserve”), under the Bank Holding Company Act (the “BHC Act”), as amended by, among other laws, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the “Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act”), and by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), enacted in 2010. We are registered with the Federal Reserve as a bank holding company (“BHC”). We must file reports with the FRB and such additional information as the FRB may require, and our holding company and non-banking affiliates are subject to examination by the FRB. Under FRB policy, a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength for its subsidiary banks. Under this policy, the FRB may require, and has required in the past, a holding company to contribute additional capital to an undercapitalized subsidiary bank. The BHC Act provides that a bank holding company must obtain FRB approval before:

• | Acquiring, directly or indirectly, ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, it would own or control more than 5% of such shares (unless it already owns or controls the majority of such shares);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company, or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Merging or consolidating with another bank holding company.
--+------------------------------------------------------------


- 11 -


The BHC Act generally prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company, or from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or providing services for its subsidiaries. The principal exceptions to these prohibitions involve certain non-bank activities which, by statute or by FRB regulation or order, have been identified as activities closely related to the business of banking or managing or controlling banks. The list of activities permitted by the FRB includes, among other things: lending; operating a savings institution, mortgage company, finance company, credit card company or factoring company; performing certain data processing operations; providing certain investment and financial advice; underwriting and acting as an insurance agent for certain types of credit related insurance; leasing property on a full-payout, non-operating basis; selling money orders, travelers’ checks and United States Savings Bonds; real estate and personal property appraising; providing tax planning and preparation services; and, subject to certain limitations, providing securities brokerage services for customers. These activities may also be affected by federal legislation.
 The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act amended portions of the BHC Act to authorize bank holding companies, such as us, directly or through non-bank subsidiaries to engage in securities, insurance and other activities that are financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity. In order to undertake these activities, a bank holding company must become a “financial holding company” by submitting to the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank a declaration that the company elects to be a financial holding company and a certification that all of the depository institutions controlled by the company are well capitalized and well managed.
 The Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) significantly changed the regulation of financial institutions and the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions affecting large and small financial institutions alike, including several provisions that will profoundly affect how community banks, thrifts, and small bank and thrift holding companies will be regulated in the future. Among other things, these provisions abolished the Office of Thrift Supervision and transferred its functions to the other federal banking agencies, relaxed rules regarding interstate branching, allowed financial institutions to pay interest on business checking accounts, and imposed new capital requirements on bank and thrift holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act also includes several corporate governance provisions that apply to all public companies, not just financial institutions. These include provisions mandating certain disclosures regarding executive compensation and provisions addressing proxy access by shareholders. We have elected to be treated as a financial holding company.
 The Dodd-Frank Act contains numerous other provisions affecting financial institutions of all types, including some that may affect our business in substantial and unpredictable ways. We have incurred higher operating costs in complying with the Dodd-Frank Act, and we expect that these higher costs will continue for the foreseeable future. Our management continues to monitor the ongoing implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act and as new regulations are issued, will assess their effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 On February 3, 2017, President Donald J. Trump issued an executive order directing the Secretary of the Treasury to report, within 120 days, on whether current governmental rules and policies either promote or inhibit the “Core Principles for Financial Regulation” as defined in the executive order (the “Executive Order”). The Treasury Department has since issued multiple reports in response to the Executive Order, the first of which, issued on June 12, 2017, analyzed and made recommendations with respect to the U.S. banking system (the “Treasury Report”). In particular, the Treasury Report recommended several actions that would ease the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act on community banks such as us, as described in greater detail below. While some of these actions may be implemented unilaterally by our regulators, others will require legislation in order to be put into effect.
 On June 8, 2017, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Financial CHOICE Act of 2017 (the “Financial CHOICE Act”), a bill that, if enacted into law, would repeal or modify key provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, including elimination of the Volcker Rule, as defined below, and making the director of the CFPB, also defined below, subject to removal by the President. President Trump has indicated that he would sign the Financial CHOICE Act, but the U.S. Senate has yet to take up that bill. In May 2018, President Trump signed into law the Economic Growth Act, which impacted several of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The enactment of the Economic Growth Act provided certain regulatory relief to community banks, like us, with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets. This relief includes an exemption from the Volcker Rule and provides for federal banking regulators to simplify capital requirement rules for community banks.
 We cannot predict how closely a final bill, if any, will resemble the Financial CHOICE Act passed by the House of Representatives in 2017. Similarly, it is too early for us to predict whether any other executive or congressional action will attempt to implement the recommendations of the Treasury Report as they pertain to the Dodd-Frank Act.
 See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for a more extensive discussion of this topic.

The Volcker Rule. The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and from investing and sponsoring hedge funds and private equity funds. The statutory provision implementing these restrictions is commonly called the “Volcker Rule.” To implement the Volcker Rule, federal regulators issued final rules in December 2013 that were to become effective April 2014. The Federal Reserve subsequently issued an order extending the period that institutions have to conform their activities to the requirements of the Volcker Rule to July 21, 2015, and extended the compliance date for banks to conform their investments in certain “legacy covered funds” until July 21, 2016. These final rules exempt the Bank, as a bank with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets that does not engage in any covered activities other than trading in certain government, agency, state or municipal obligations, from any significant compliance obligations under the Volcker Rule; therefore, the Volcker Rule will not have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the Economic Growth Act, signed into law in 2018, exempted this category of community banks from complying with the Volcker Rule. We cannot predict whether we may become subject to the Volcker Rule following additional legislative or regulatory action concerning community banks.
 Depository Institution Regulation.    The Bank is subject to regulation by the FDIC. This regulatory structure includes:
  
• | Real estate lending standards, which provide guidelines concerning loan-to-value ratios for various types of real estate loans;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Risk-based capital rules, including accounting for interest rate risk, concentration of credit risk and the risks posed by non-traditional activities;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rules requiring depository institutions to develop and implement internal procedures to evaluate and control credit and settlement exposure to their correspondent banks;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rules restricting types and amounts of equity investments; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rules addressing various safety and soundness issues, including operations and managerial standards, standards for asset quality, earnings and compensation standards.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Capital Requirements. The Company and the Bank are each required to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards established by the Federal Reserve. The current risk-based capital standards applicable to the Company and the Bank, parts of which are currently in the process of being phased in, are based on the final capital framework for strengthening international capital standards, known as Basel III, of the Basel Committee.
 Prior to January 1, 2015, the risk-based capital standards applicable to the Company and the Bank (the “General Risk-based Capital Rules”) were based on the 1988 Capital Accord, known as Basel I, of the Basel Committee. In July 2013, the federal bank regulators approved the final Basel III Rules implementing the Basel III framework as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Basel III Rules substantially revised the risk-based capital requirements applicable to BHCs and their depository institution subsidiaries, including the Company and the Bank, as compared to the General Risk-based Capital Rules. The Basel III Rules became effective for the Company and the Bank on January 1, 2015 (subject to a phase-in period for certain provisions).
 The Basel III Rules, among other things, (i) introduce a new capital measure called CET1, which consists primarily of retained earnings and common stock, (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and “Additional Tier 1 capital” instruments, such as preferred stock and certain convertible securities, meeting certain revised requirements, (iii) define CET1 narrowly by requiring that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital, and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions/adjustments to capital as compared to existing regulations.
 Under the Basel III Rules, the minimum capital ratios effective as of January 1, 2015 are:
  
• | 4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets;
--+-----------------------------------


• | 6.0% Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 8.0% Total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Basel III Rules also introduce a new capital conservation buffer designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. The capital conservation buffer is an amount in addition to these minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements. The Basel III Rules also provide for a countercyclical capital buffer applicable only to certain covered institutions. We do not expect the countercyclical capital buffer to be applicable to the Company or the Bank. Banking institutions that do not hold capital above the required minimum levels, including the capital conservation buffer, will face constraints on dividends and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall.
 The Basel III Rules became fully phased in effective January 1, 2019 and will require the Company and the Bank to maintain an additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, effectively resulting in minimum ratios of (i) CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5%, and (iii) Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5%.
 The Basel III Rules also provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage-servicing rights (“MSRs”), certain deferred tax assets and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such items, in the aggregate, exceed 15% of CET1.

- 13 -


Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015 and was phased in over a 4-year period (beginning at 40% on January 1, 2015 and an additional 20% per year thereafter). The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and was phased in over a 4-year period (increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reached 2.5% on January 1, 2019).
 The Basel III Rules prescribe a new standardized approach for risk weightings that expands the risk-weighting categories from the four Basel I-derived categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a much larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset classes.
 The Economic Growth Act provided for a potential exception from the Basel III Rules for community banks that maintain a “Community Bank Leverage Ratio” of at least 8.0% to 10.0%, to be determined based on final rulemaking from federal banking regulators. Until further action is taken to implement the provisions of the Economic Growth Act, we cannot predict whether or to what extent we will continue to be subject to the Basel III Rules in the future, including as of the final phase-in date of January 1, 2019.
 Leverage Requirements. BHCs and banks are also required to comply with minimum leverage ratio requirements. These requirements provide for a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to total consolidated quarterly average assets (as defined for regulatory purposes), net of the loan loss reserve, goodwill and certain other intangible assets (the “leverage ratio”), of 4.0%.
 Liquidity Regulation. During 2014, the U.S. banking agencies adopted final rules implementing one of the two new standards provided for in the Basel III liquidity framework - its liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”), which is designed to ensure that a bank maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high quality liquid assets equal to the bank’s expected net cash outflows for a thirty-day time horizon under an acute liquidity stress scenario. The rules as adopted apply in their most comprehensive form only to advanced approaches bank holding companies and depository institution subsidiaries of such bank holding companies and, in a modified form, to banking organizations having $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets. Accordingly, they do not apply to either the Company or the Bank. As a result, we do not manage our balance sheet to be compliant with these rules.
 The Basel III framework also included a second standard, referred to as the net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”), which is designed to promote more medium-and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banks over a one-year time horizon. Although the Basel Committee finalized its formulation of the NSFR in 2014, the U.S. banking agencies have not yet proposed an NSFR for application to U.S. banking organizations or addressed the scope of banking organizations to which it will apply. The Basel Committee’s final NSFR document states that the NSFR applies to internationally active banks, as did its final LCR document as to that ratio.
 Prompt Corrective Action. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (“FDIA”), requires, among other things, the federal banking agencies to take “prompt corrective action” in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA establishes five capital categories for FDIC-insured banks: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, under-capitalized, significantly under-capitalized and critically under-capitalized. Under rules in effect through December 31, 2014, a depository institution is deemed to be “well-capitalized” if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, and a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater, and the institution is not subject to an order, written agreement, capital directive or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific level for any capital measure. As of January 1, 2015, the standards for “well-capitalized” status under prompt corrective action regulations changed by, among other things, introducing a CET 1 ratio requirement of 6.5% and increasing the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio requirement from 6.0% to 8.0%. The total risk-based capital ratio and Tier 1 leverage ratio requirements remain at 10.0% and 5.0%, respectively.
 The FDIA imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions, depending on the capital category in which an institution is classified. The current capital rule established by the federal bank regulators, discussed above under “Capital Requirements,” amend the prompt corrective action requirements in certain respects, including adding a CET1 risk-based capital ratio as one of the metrics (with a minimum 6.5% ratio for well-capitalized status) and increasing the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio required for each of the five capital categories, including an increase from 6.0% to 8.0% to be well-capitalized.
 For further information regarding the capital ratios and leverage ratio of the Company and the Bank see the section titled “Capital Resources” in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The current requirements and the actual levels for the Company and the Bank are detailed in Note 12, Regulatory Matters, of the notes to consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Dividends. The FRB policy is that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that its net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the holding company’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition, and that it is inappropriate for a bank holding company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. Furthermore, a bank that is classified under the prompt corrective action regulations as “undercapitalized” will be prohibited from paying any dividends.
 - 14 -


The primary source of cash for dividends we pay is the dividends we receive from the Bank. The Bank is subject to various regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain capital above regulatory minimums. Approval of the New York State Department of Financial Services (the “NY DFS”) is required prior to paying a dividend if the dividend declared by the Bank exceeds the sum of the Bank’s net profits for that year and its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years. At January 1, 2019, the Bank could declare dividends of $49.7 million from retained net profits of the preceding two years. The Bank declared dividends of $20.0 million in 2018 and $12.0 million in 2017.
 Federal Deposit Insurance Assessments.      The Bank is a member of the FDIC and pays an insurance premium to the FDIC based upon its assessable assets on a quarterly basis. Deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC and such insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government.
 Under the Dodd-Frank Act, a permanent increase in deposit insurance was authorized to $250,000. The coverage limit is per depositor, per insured depository institution for each account ownership category.
 The Dodd-Frank Act also set a new minimum Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) reserve ratio at 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The FDIC is required to attain this ratio by September 30, 2020. The Dodd-Frank Act also required the FDIC to define the deposit insurance assessment base for an insured depository institution as an amount equal to the institution’s average consolidated total assets during the assessment period minus average tangible equity. Premiums for the Bank are now calculated based upon the average balance of total assets minus average tangible equity as of the close of business for each day during the calendar quarter.  As of September 30, 2018, the FDIC had exceeded the minimum reserve ratio of 1.35%.  Certain institutions will receive credits for the portion of their regular assessments that contributed to growth in the reserve ratio to 1.35%, which will apply to reduce regular assessments for quarters when the reserve ratio is at least 1.38%.  In January 2019, the FDIC notified the Bank that it would be eligible for these credits to offset future deposit insurance assessments.
 The FDIC has the flexibility to adopt actual rates that are higher or lower than the total base assessment rates adopted without notice and comment, if certain conditions are met.
 DIF-insured institutions pay a Financing Corporation (“FICO”) assessment in order to fund the interest on bonds issued in the 1980s in connection with the failures in the thrift industry. For the fourth quarter of 2018, the FICO assessment was equal to 0.14 basis points (annualized) computed on assets as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. These assessments will continue until the bonds mature in 2019.
 The FDIC is authorized to conduct examinations of and require reporting by FDIC-insured institutions. It is also authorized to terminate a depository bank’s deposit insurance upon a finding by the FDIC that the bank’s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule, regulation, order or condition enacted or imposed by the bank’s regulatory agency. The termination of deposit insurance for the Bank would have a material adverse effect on our earnings, operations and financial condition.
 Consumer Laws and Regulations. In addition to the laws and regulations discussed herein, the Bank is also subject to certain consumer federal and state laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks. While the list set forth herein is not exhaustive, these laws and regulations include, among others, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act and these laws’ respective state-law counterparts, as well as state usury laws and laws regarding unfair and deceptive acts and practices. These and other federal and state laws, among other things, require disclosures of the cost of credit and terms of deposit accounts, provide substantive consumer rights, prohibit discrimination in credit transactions, regulate the use of credit report information, provide financial privacy protections, prohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive practices, restrict the Company’s ability to raise interest rates and subject the Company to substantial regulatory oversight. Violations of applicable consumer protection laws can result in significant potential liability from litigation brought by customers, including actual damages, restitution and attorneys’ fees. Federal and state bank regulators, federal law enforcement agencies, state attorneys general and state and local consumer protection agencies may also seek to enforce consumer protection requirements and obtain these and other remedies, including regulatory sanctions, customer rescission rights, fines and civil money penalties. Failure to comply with consumer protection requirements may also result in our failure to obtain any required bank regulatory approval for merger or acquisition transactions the Company may wish to pursue or our prohibition from engaging in such transactions even if approval is not required.

The Dodd-Frank Act centralized responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), and giving it responsibility for implementing, examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer protection laws. The CFPB focuses on:
  
• | Risks to consumers and compliance with the federal consumer financial laws, when it evaluates the policies and practices of a financial institution;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The markets in which firms operate and risks to consumers posed by activities in those markets;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Depository institutions that offer a wide variety of consumer financial products and services; depository institutions with a more specialized focus; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Non-depository companies that offer one or more consumer financial products or services.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial laws that apply to all banks, including, among other things, the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. Abusive acts or practices are defined as those that materially interfere with a consumer’s ability to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or service or take unreasonable advantage of a consumer’s (i) lack of financial savvy, (ii) inability to protect himself in the selection or use of consumer financial products or services, or (iii) reasonable reliance on a covered entity to act in the consumer’s interests. The CFPB can issue cease-and-desist orders against banks and other entities that violate consumer financial laws. The CFPB may also institute a civil action against an entity in violation of federal consumer financial law in order to impose a civil penalty or injunction. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with more than $10 billion in assets, as well as their affiliates.
 Neither the recommendations of the Treasury Report nor the Financial CHOICE Act provide for the abolishment of the CFPB; both, however, call for the director of the CFPB to be subject to removal by the President and for repeal of the CFPB’s authority to perform examinations. We cannot predict whether or how the CFPB will be impacted by either pending or future legislation or by possible future executive action.
 Banking regulators take into account compliance with consumer protection laws when considering approval of a proposed transaction.
 Community Reinvestment Act. Pursuant to the Community Reinvestment Act (the “CRA”), under federal and New York State law, the Bank is obligated, consistent with safe and sound banking practices, to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods. The FRB of New York and NY DFS periodically assess the Bank’s record of performance under the CRA and issue one of the following ratings: “Outstanding,” “Satisfactory,” “Needs to Improve,” or “Substantial Noncompliance.”
 The most recently completed evaluation of the Bank’s performance under the CRA was conducted by the FRB of New York for the time period January 2011 through September 2013 and was disclosed to us in March 2018. This performance evaluation resulted in an overall rating by the FRB of New York of “Needs to Improve.” In reaching this rating the FRB of New York considered several factors, including the geographic distribution of loans we made from January 2011 through September 2013 in the Buffalo and Rochester metropolitan areas, the accessibility of our retail delivery systems and our level of compliance during the time period with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act. We believe the Bank has made significant improvements in these areas since September 2013 and we are firmly committed to fair and responsible banking and helping to meet the credit needs of all segments of the communities that we serve.
 The FRB of New York’s evaluation of the Bank’s January 2011 through September 2013 CRA performance may subject the Bank to enhanced scrutiny in any application it files with the FRB of New York or the NY DFS with respect to, among other things, the establishment of new branches, the expansion or relocation of existing branches, or the acquisition by the Bank of another depository institution. While the approval or denial of such an application is typically a facts and circumstances based determination, a less than satisfactory CRA rating would be one of the factors our regulators will consider in their review.
 The NY DFS is assessing our CRA performance since 2012 and has not yet completed its evaluation. The last CRA evaluation completed by the NY DFS was in 2011 and resulted in the Bank being rated as “Outstanding.”
 Privacy Rules. Federal banking regulators, as required under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, have adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties. The rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to non-affiliated third parties. The privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial services companies and conveyed to outside vendors.
 In February 2017, the NY DFS issued a final rule, which became effective on March 1, 2017, requiring New York State-chartered or licensed banks regulated by the NY DFS, such as us, to adopt broad cybersecurity protections. Specifically, we are now required to establish a program designed to ensure the safety of our information systems, adopt a written cybersecurity policy, designate an information security officer, and comply with NY DFS certification and reporting requirements. Compliance with this rule is subject to four phase-in dates between September 2017 and March 2019.

Anti-Money Laundering and the USA Patriot Act. A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions in recent years has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, or the USA Patriot Act, substantially broadened the scope of United States anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. Financial institutions are also prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must use enhanced due diligence procedures in their dealings with certain types of high-risk customers and implement a written customer identification program. Financial institutions must take certain steps to assist government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering and report certain types of suspicious transactions. Regulatory authorities routinely examine financial institutions for compliance with these obligations, and for the failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution, including causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required. Regulatory authorities have imposed cease and desist orders and civil money penalties against institutions found to be violating these obligations.
 Interstate Branching. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, national and state-chartered banks may open an initial branch in a state other than its home state (e.g., a host state) by establishing a de novo branch at any location in such host state at which a bank chartered in such host state could establish a branch. Applications to establish such branches must still be filed with the appropriate primary federal regulator. It is too early to predict whether President Trump’s Executive Order or any subsequent presidential or congressional action will result in any change to a bank’s ability to establish a de novo branch in a host state.
 Transactions with Affiliates. FII, FSB, Five Star REIT, SDN, Courier Capital and HNP Capital are affiliates within the meaning of the Federal Reserve Act. The Federal Reserve Act imposes limitations on a bank with respect to extensions of credit to, investments in, and certain other transactions with, its parent bank holding company and the holding company’s other subsidiaries. Furthermore, bank loans and extensions of credit to affiliates also are subject to various collateral requirements.
 Various governmental requirements, including Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the FRB’s Regulation W, limit borrowings by FII and its nonbank subsidiaries from FSB, and also limit various other transactions between FII and its nonbank subsidiaries, on the one hand, and FSB, on the other. For example, Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act limits the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institution’s loans and other “covered transactions” with any particular nonbank affiliate to no more than 10% of the institution’s total capital and limits the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institution’s covered transactions with all of its nonbank affiliates to no more than 20% of its total capital. “Covered transactions” are defined by statute to include a loan or extension of credit, as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate, a purchase of assets (unless otherwise exempted by the FRB) from the affiliate, the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan, and the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate. Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act also generally requires that an insured depository institution’s loans to its nonbank affiliates be, at a minimum, 100% secured, and Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act generally requires that an insured depository institution’s transactions with its nonbank affiliates be on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same or at least as favorable as those prevailing for comparable transactions with non-affiliates. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly expanded the coverage and scope of the limitations on affiliate transactions within a banking organization. For example, commencing in July 2012, the Dodd-Frank Act applies the 10% of capital limit on covered transactions to financial subsidiaries and amends the definition of “covered transaction” to include (i) securities borrowing or lending transactions with an affiliate, and (ii) all derivatives transactions with an affiliate, to the extent that either causes a bank or its affiliate to have credit exposure to the securities borrowing/lending or derivative counterparty.
 Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation. The U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries and regimes, under authority of various laws, including designated foreign countries, nationals and others. OFAC publishes lists of specially designated targets and countries. The Company is responsible for, among other things, blocking accounts of, and transactions with, such targets and countries, prohibiting unlicensed trade and financial transactions with them and reporting blocked transactions after their occurrence. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences, including causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required.
 Insurance Regulation. SDN is required to be licensed or receive regulatory approval in nearly every state in which it does business. In addition, most jurisdictions require individuals who engage in brokerage and certain other insurance service activities to be personally licensed. These licensing laws and regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In most jurisdictions, licensing laws and regulations generally grant broad discretion to supervisory authorities to adopt and amend regulations and to supervise regulated activities.

Investment Advisory Regulation. Courier Capital and HNP Capital are providers of investment consulting and financial planning services and, as such, are each considered an “investment adviser” under the U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”). An investment adviser is any person or entity that provides advice to others, or that issues reports or analyses, regarding securities for compensation. While a BHC is generally excluded from regulation under the Advisers Act, the SEC has stated that this exclusion does not apply to investment adviser subsidiaries of BHCs, such as Courier Capital and HNP Capital. Since Courier Capital and HNP Capital each have over $100 million in assets under management they are individually considered a “large adviser,” which requires registration with the SEC by filing Form ADV and updating it at least once each year, and more frequently under certain specified circumstances. This registration covers Courier Capital or HNP Capital and its employees as well as other persons under their control and supervision, such as independent contractors, provided that their activities are undertaken on behalf of Courier Capital or HNP Capital.
 In addition to these registration requirements, the Advisers Act contains numerous other provisions that impose obligations on investment advisors. For example, Section 206 includes anti-fraud provisions that courts have interpreted as establishing fiduciary duties extending to all services undertaken on behalf of the client. These duties include, but are not limited to, the disclosure of all material facts to clients, providing only suitable investment advice, and seeking best price execution of trades. Section 206 also has specific rules relating to, among other things, advertising, safeguarding client assets, the engagement of third-parties, the duty to supervise persons acting on the investment adviser’s behalf, and the establishment of an effective internal compliance program and a code of ethics.
 Courier Capital and HNP Capital are subject to each of these obligations and, as applicable, restrictions, and are also subject to examination by the SEC’s Office of Compliance, Investigations, and Examinations to assess their overall compliance with the Advisers Act and the effectiveness of their internal controls.
 Prior to our acquisition of Courier Capital in January 2016 and HNP Capital in June 2018, the Bank had provided investment advisory and broker-dealer services to its customers through its subsidiary Five Star Investment Services, Inc. Commencing in October 2013, the Bank entered into a partnership with LPL Financial, one of the nation’s largest independent financial services companies (“LPL”), to provide investment advisory and broker-dealer services to its customers through LPL. This partnership continues and the Bank employs wealth advisors, who are licensed by LPL, to provide investment advisory and broker-dealer services to the Bank’s customers. LPL is an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act and is subject to its provisions.
 Incentive Compensation. Our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve. In June 2010, the Federal banking agencies issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization’s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board of directors.
 The Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal banking agencies to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total consolidated assets (which would include the Company and the Bank) that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees or benefits or that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. In addition, the agencies must establish regulations or guidelines requiring enhanced disclosure to regulators of incentive-based compensation arrangements. In May 2016, six federal agencies, including the FRB, the FDIC and the SEC, invited public comments on a proposed rule to accomplish this mandate; no final rule has since been issued, however, and it is uncertain at this time whether the agencies intend to further pursue the rule for the foreseeable future.
 The FRB will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as the Company, that are not “large, complex banking organizations.” These reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization’s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization’s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.

Other Future Legislation and Changes in Regulations. In addition to the specific proposals described above, from time to time, various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in Congress and state legislatures, as well as by regulatory agencies. Such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system. Such legislation could change banking statutes and/or our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. We cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on our financial condition or results of operations. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to us or our subsidiaries could have a material effect on our business.
 Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices
 Our financial statements included herein have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires us to measure financial position and operating results principally using historic dollars. Changes in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered. The primary effect of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs. We believe changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of a financial institution to a far greater degree than changes in the inflation rate. While interest rates are generally influenced by changes in the inflation rate, they do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same magnitude. Interest rates are sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including changes in the expected rate of inflation, general and local economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government, its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities.
Regulatory and Economic Policies
 Our business and earnings are affected by general and local economic conditions and by the monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. government, its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities. The FRB regulates the supply of money in order to influence general economic conditions. Among the instruments of monetary policy available to the FRB are (i) conducting open market operations in U.S. government obligations, (ii) changing the discount rate on financial institution borrowings, (iii) imposing or changing reserve requirements against financial institution deposits, and (iv) restricting certain borrowings and imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by financial institutions and their affiliates. These methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits, as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits. For that reason, the policies of the FRB could have a material effect on our earnings.
 On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJ Act”) was signed into law which, among other items, reduced the federal statutory corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, effective January 1, 2018.
 EMPLOYEES
 At December 31, 2018, we had 725 employees, none of whom are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Management believes our overall relations with employees are good.
