Strategic Update 
 We continue to focus on improving business performance, addressing financial leverage and increasing financial and strategic flexibility across the organization. Our strategy includes maximizing our opportunities in our mortgage insurance businesses and stabilizing our U.S. life insurance businesses. 
China Oceanwide Transaction 
 On October 21, 2016, Genworth Financial, Inc. (Genworth Financial) entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the Merger Agreement) with Asia Pacific Global Capital Co., Ltd. (Parent), a limited liability company incorporated in the Peoples Republic of China and a subsidiary of China Oceanwide Holdings Group Co., Ltd., a limited liability company incorporated in the Peoples Republic of China (together with its affiliates, China Oceanwide), and Asia Pacific Global Capital USA Corporation (Merger Sub), a Delaware corporation and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Asia Pacific Insurance USA Holdings LLC (Asia Pacific Insurance), which is a Delaware limited liability company and owned by China Oceanwide, pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub would merge with and into Genworth Financial with Genworth Financial surviving the merger as an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Asia Pacific Insurance (the Merger). China Oceanwide has agreed to acquire all of our outstanding common stock for a total transaction value of approximately $2.7 billion, or $5.43 per share in cash. At a special meeting held on March 7, 2017, Genworth Financials stockholders voted on and approved a proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. 
 Genworth Financial and China Oceanwide continue to work towards satisfying the closing conditions of the Merger as soon as possible. In December 2018 and January 2019, we received the remaining approvals from our U.S. domestic insurance regulators. These approvals had multiple conditions, including but not limited to, the Merger being consummated without the purchase of Genworth Life and Annuity Insurance Company (GLAIC) from Genworth Life Insurance Company (GLIC) by a Genworth intermediate holding company, which had been initially proposed and which we refer to as the GLAIC unstacking. Our U.S. domestic regulatory approvals included the approval from the Delaware Department of Insurance (DDOI). Genworth Financial and China Oceanwide worked with the DDOI and other regulators to obtain approval of the Merger without the GLAIC unstacking throughout the second half of 2018. As part of the DDOI approval, Genworth Financial and China Oceanwide agreed, following the Merger, Genworth Holdings, Inc. (Genworth Holdings) will contribute $175 million to GLIC, which was previously committed by Genworth Financial to be used as partial consideration for the GLAIC unstacking. The $175 million will be contributed in three equal tranches, with the first contribution completed by the end of March 2019, the second contribution completed by the end of September 2019 and the final contribution completed by the end of January 2020. In addition, at or before the closing of the Merger, GLAIC will purchase from GLIC an intercompany note with a principal amount of $200 million. This intercompany note was issued by Genworth Holdings to GLIC, with Genworth Holdings obligated to pay the principal amount on the maturity date of March 2020. The purchase price will be at fair value, but not less than $200 million. No changes will be made to the existing terms of the intercompany note, other than Genworth Holdings will now pay GLAIC the principal amount of the note at maturity. Likewise, the amount will continue to be eliminated in consolidation. 
 In October 2018, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) of the Peoples Republic of China accepted China Oceanwides filing in connection with the Merger Agreement, which concluded NDRCs review process and enables China Oceanwide to move forward with the clearance in China for currency conversion and the transfer of funds.

 In June 2018, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) completed its review of the proposed transaction and concluded that there are no unresolved national security concerns with respect to the proposed transaction. The completion of the CFIUS review satisfied one of the conditions to closing the proposed transaction. In connection with the CFIUS review of the proposed transaction, Genworth Financial and China Oceanwide entered into an agreement to implement a data security risk mitigation plan, which includes, among other things, the use of a U.S. third-party service provider and an independent security monitor to protect the personal data of Genworth Financials policyholders and customers in the United States. 
 The closing of the Merger remains subject to other conditions, including the required regulatory approval in Canada. Approval by the U.S. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) remains outstanding, but pursuant to FINRA rules, the transaction may proceed and closing may occur before such approval is obtained. In addition, China Oceanwide will need to receive clearance in China for currency conversion and the transfer of funds. 
 On January 30, 2019, Genworth Financial, Parent and Merger Sub entered into an eighth waiver and agreement (Eighth Waiver and Agreement) pursuant to which Genworth Financial and Parent each agreed to waive until March 15, 2019 its right to terminate the Merger Agreement and abandon the Merger in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. The Eighth Waiver and Agreement extended the seventh waiver and agreement extension deadline of January 31, 2019 to allow additional time for the remaining regulatory approval and clearance processes. 
 On August 14, 2018, under the sixth waiver and agreement, Genworth Financial and China Oceanwide waived, among other things: (i) the parties obligation to effect the GLAIC unstacking and China Oceanwides obligation to contribute to us $525 million for such purpose; and (ii) China Oceanwides obligation to contribute $600 million for the purpose of retiring our senior unsecured notes due in May 2018 (the May 2018 senior notes). These waivers are discussed further below. 
 As part of the transaction, China Oceanwide originally committed in the Merger Agreement to contribute $525 million of cash for the purpose of facilitating the GLAIC unstacking. This contribution combined with $175 million of cash previously committed by Genworth Holdings was intended to enable a Genworth intermediate holding company to purchase GLAIC from GLIC, a Delaware-domiciled insurance entity, for a purchase price of $700 million and complete the GLAIC unstacking. After extensive discussions with the DDOI on different methodologies for establishing the fair market value for GLAIC, the parties and the DDOI were unable to agree on the fair market value of GLAIC. Therefore, the parties decided to forgo the GLAIC unstacking and, accordingly under the sixth waiver and agreement, Genworth Financial and China Oceanwide waived the Merger Agreement provisions related to the GLAIC unstacking including China Oceanwides obligation to make the originally contemplated $525 million contribution. 
 China Oceanwide originally committed in the Merger Agreement to contribute $600 million of cash to Genworth, subject to the consummation of the Merger, to address the May 2018 senior notes on or before their maturity. Due to the delays in the completion of the transaction, Genworth entered into the $450 million senior secured term loan facility (Term Loan), as discussed below. Instead of the $600 million contribution from China Oceanwide, the proceeds of the Term Loan, together with $175 million of cash on hand, were used to retire the May 2018 senior notes. Therefore, under the sixth waiver and agreement, Genworth Financial and China Oceanwide waived the $600 million contribution for the May 2018 senior notes and accordingly China Oceanwide did not, and is no longer obligated to, make the originally contemplated $600 million contribution. 
 China Oceanwide and Genworth have agreed on a capital investment plan under which China Oceanwide and/or its affiliates will contribute an aggregate of $1.5 billion to Genworth over time following consummation of the Merger, with the final amounts of the plan expected to be contributed by December 31, 2019. This contribution is subject to the closing of the Merger and the receipt of required regulatory approvals. The $1.5 billion contribution would be used to further improve our financial stability, which could include retiring debt due in 2020 and 2021 or enabling future growth opportunities. 
 
5 


 At this time Genworth Financial and China Oceanwide remain committed to satisfying the closing conditions under the Merger Agreement as soon as possible. However, if the parties are unable to satisfy the closing conditions by March 15, 2019 and are unable to reach an agreement as to a further extension of the deadline, then either party may terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to its terms. 
 If the China Oceanwide transaction is completed, we will be a standalone subsidiary and our senior management team will continue to lead the business from our current headquarters in Richmond, Virginia. Likewise, we intend to maintain our existing portfolio of businesses, including our mortgage insurance businesses in Australia and Canada. Except for the specific monitoring and reporting required under the CFIUS data security risk mitigation plan, our day-to-day operations are not expected to change as a result of this transaction. 
 Restructuring of U.S. Life Insurance Businesses 
 One of our previous strategic objectives was to separate, through the GLAIC unstacking, and then isolate, through a series of internal transactions, our long-term care insurance business from our other U.S. life insurance businesses. Our goal under the plan had been to align substantially all of our non-New York in-force life insurance and annuity business under GLAIC, our Virginia domiciled life insurance company, and substantially all of our non-New York long-term care insurance business under GLIC, our Delaware domiciled life insurance company. 
 On August 14, 2018, Genworth Financial and China Oceanwide entered into the sixth waiver and agreement, pursuant to which the parties waived the provisions in the Merger Agreement related to the GLAIC unstacking. Because of the decision by Genworth Financial and China Oceanwide not to pursue the GLAIC unstacking at this time in connection with the Merger, it is now contemplated that we will not pursue the GLAIC unstacking as a part of our strategic objective to restructure our U.S. life insurance businesses for the foreseeable future. However, we will continue to work to stabilize our long-term care insurance business primarily through our multi-year long-term care insurance in-force rate action plan. Increased premiums and associated benefit reductions on our legacy long-term care insurance policies are critical to support the policy claims of the business. 
 Given that Genworth Financial and China Oceanwide will no longer pursue the GLAIC unstacking, and in line with Genworth Financials strategic objective to restructure its U.S. life insurance businesses through isolating the long-term care insurance business, Genworth Holdings completed a bond consent solicitation on October 4, 2018 to amend its senior notes indenture to clarify that GLAIC and the subsidiaries of GLIC, GLAIC and Genworth Life Insurance Company of New York (GLICNY) are excluded from the class of subsidiaries for which a bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceeding would result in an event of default under the indenture with respect to certain outstanding senior notes. 
 China Oceanwide has no current intention or future obligation to contribute additional capital to support our legacy long-term care insurance business. The parties have agreed, however, that following the closing of the Merger, Genworth Holdings would contribute $175 million in aggregate to GLIC over time. 
 Term Loan 
 Due to the delay in the closing of the China Oceanwide transaction, we entered into the Term Loan with an aggregate principal amount of $450 million that closed in March 2018. Proceeds of $441 million from the Term Loan were used together with $175 million of cash on hand to retire the principal and accrued interest of the May 2018 senior notes. An affiliate of China Oceanwide was the lead investor in the transaction. This affiliate sold its $60 million investment in the Term Loan during the fourth quarter of 2018. The Term Loan includes a limited recourse guarantee secured by the publicly listed shares of Genworth MI Canada Inc. (Genworth Canada), held by Genworth Financial International Holdings, LLC (GFIH), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Genworth Financial.

 Strategic Alternatives 
 If the China Oceanwide transaction is not completed, we will continue to explore strategic alternatives and financing options to address our ongoing challenges. As a result of the recent performance of our long-term care and life insurance businesses and the charges we recorded in the third quarter of 2016 and fourth quarters of 2016, 2017 and 2018, absent any alternative commitment of external capital, we believe there would be: increased pressure on and potential further downgrades of our financial strength ratings, particularly for our mortgage insurance businesses, which could affect our ability to maintain our market share of the U.S. mortgage insurance industry; limitations on our ability to continue to write new long-term care insurance policies; and other limitations on our holding company liquidity and ability to service and/or refinance our holding company debt. 
 In the absence of the transaction with China Oceanwide, which we can neither predict nor guarantee, we may need to pursue strategic asset sales to address our debt maturities, including potential sales of our mortgage insurance businesses in Canada and/or Australia. We have and would continue to evaluate options to insulate our U.S. mortgage insurance business from additional ratings pressure, including a potential partial sale, in the event the transaction with China Oceanwide cannot be completed. Changes to our financial projections, including changes that anticipate planned asset sales, may negatively impact our ability to realize certain foreign tax credits or other deferred tax assets and have a resulting material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 Ongoing Priorities 
 Stabilizing our U.S. life insurance businesses continues to be one of our long-term goals. We will continue to execute against this objective primarily through our multi-year long-term care insurance in-force rate action plan. Increased premiums and associated benefit reductions on our legacy long-term care insurance policies are critical to support the policy claims of the business. In addition, reducing debt will remain a high priority. We believe that increased financial support and our strengthened financial foundation resulting from the China Oceanwide transaction would provide us with more options to manage our debt maturities and reduce overall indebtedness, which in turn is intended to improve our credit and ratings profile over time. Finally, we also believe that the completion of the China Oceanwide transaction would allow us to place greater focus on the future of our long-term care and mortgage insurance businesses while continuing to service our existing policyholders. 
 For a discussion of the risks associated with the China Oceanwide transaction and our strategic alternatives, see Item 1ARisk FactorsThe proposed transaction with China Oceanwide may not be completed or may not be completed within the timeframe, terms or in the manner currently anticipated, which could have a material adverse effect on us and our stock price.

 U.S. Mortgage Insurance 
 Through our U.S. Mortgage Insurance segment, we provide private mortgage insurance. Private mortgage insurance enables borrowers to buy homes with a down payment of less than 20% of the homes value (low down payment mortgages or high loan-to-value mortgages). Mortgage insurance protects lenders against loss in the event of a borrowers default. It also generally aids financial institutions in managing their capital efficiently by, in some cases, reducing the capital required for low down payment mortgages. If a borrower defaults on mortgage payments, private mortgage insurance reduces and may eliminate losses to the insured institution. Private mortgage insurance may also facilitate the sale of mortgage loans in the secondary mortgage market because of the credit enhancement it provides. Our mortgage insurance products predominantly insure prime-based, individually underwritten residential mortgage loans (flow mortgage insurance). We selectively 
 
7 


  provide mortgage insurance on a bulk basis (bulk mortgage insurance) with essentially all of our bulk writings being prime-based. 
 We have been providing mortgage insurance products and services in the United States since 1981 and operate in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Our principal mortgage insurance customers are originators of residential mortgage loans who typically determine which mortgage insurer or insurers they will use for the placement of mortgage insurance written on loans they originate. For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 21% of new insurance written in our U.S. mortgage insurance business was attributable to our largest five lender customers, with no customer representing more than 10% of new insurance written. 
 The U.S. private mortgage insurance industry is affected in part by the requirements and practices of the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac). Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are government-sponsored enterprises and we refer to them collectively as the GSEs. The GSEs purchase and provide guarantees on residential mortgages as part of their governmental mandate to provide liquidity through the secondary mortgage market. The GSEs may purchase mortgages with unpaid principal amounts up to a specified maximum, known as the conforming loan limit, which is currently $484,350 (up to $726,525 in certain high-cost geographic areas of the country) and subject to annual adjustment. 
 Each GSEs Congressional charter generally prohibits it from purchasing a mortgage where the loan-to-value ratio exceeds 80% of the home value unless the portion of the unpaid principal balance of the mortgage in excess of 80% of the value of the property securing the mortgage is protected against default by lender recourse, participation or by a qualified insurer. Much of the demand for private mortgage insurance is a function of the requirements of the GSEs. The GSEs purchased the majority of the flow loans we insured as of December 31, 2018. The GSEs specify mortgage insurance coverage levels and also have the authority to change the pricing arrangements for purchasing retained-participation mortgages, or mortgages with lender recourse, as compared to insured mortgages, increase or reduce required mortgage insurance coverage percentages, and alter or liberalize underwriting standards and pricing terms on low down payment mortgages they purchase. In furtherance of their respective charter requirements, each GSE maintains eligibility criteria to establish when a mortgage insurer is qualified to issue coverage that will be acceptable to the GSEs for high loan-to-value mortgages they acquire. For more information about the financial and other requirements of the GSEs for our U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiaries, see RegulationMortgage Insurance RegulationOther U.S. regulation. 
 Selected financial information and operating performance measures regarding our U.S. Mortgage Insurance segment are included under Part IIItem 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsU.S. Mortgage Insurance segment. 
 Products and services 
 The majority of our U.S. mortgage insurance policies provide primary default loss protection on a portion (typically 10% to 40%, known as the coverage percentage) of the outstanding principal balance of an individual mortgage loan plus specified expenses. The lender selects the coverage percentage at the time the loan is originated, often to comply with loan investor requirements. Primary mortgage insurance is placed through flow or bulk mortgage insurance policies. 
 Flow insurance applications are submitted on a loan by loan basis, either before or shortly after the loan closes (usually no more than 120 days from loan closing). The loan amount and coverage percentage determine our risk in-force on each insured loan. The lender may require the borrower to pay for the mortgage insurance under the terms of the mortgage in which case the premium is typically included in the borrowers monthly mortgage payment (borrower paid mortgage insurance). Lenders also may offer to finance the premium by including it in the loan balance and disbursing funds to the mortgage insurer at the loan closing. Lenders may also directly fund the insurance premium (lender paid mortgage insurance) and may seek to recover that 
 
8 


  expense from the interest or fees charged on the mortgage. Our primary mortgage insurance policies are predominantly flow mortgage insurance policies. 
 In addition to flow primary mortgage insurance, we have in prior years written mortgage insurance on a bulk and pool basis. Bulk mortgage insurance transactions provide coverage on a finite set of individual loans identified by the bulk policy. Bulk policies may contain coverage percentages and provisions limiting the insurers obligation to pay claims until a threshold amount is reached (known as a deductible) or capping the insurers potential aggregate liability for claims payments (a stop loss). Under pool insurance, the mortgage insurer provides coverage for 100% of the loss on a loan (i.e., without the application of a coverage percentage on individual loans within the pool). Bulk and pool insurance typically are secondary coverage to any primary insurance that may be on a loan and the insurer typically is no longer required to cover losses above the stop loss. Lenders negotiate the terms and conditions of bulk and pool coverage including loan type eligibility, stop losses, premium amounts and coverage termination. 
 We also perform fee-based contract underwriting services for mortgage lenders. The provision of underwriting services by mortgage insurers eliminates the duplicative lender and mortgage insurer underwriting activities and expedites the approval process. Under the terms of our contract underwriting agreements, we agree to indemnify the lender against losses incurred in the event we make material errors in determining whether loans processed by our contract underwriters meet specified underwriting or purchase criteria, subject to contractual limitations on liability. 
 Underwriting and pricing 
 Insurance applications comprised in part of information from the loan application file for all flow loans we insure are reviewed to determine eligibility based on underwriting guidelines we approve as well as to establish the applicable premium. We evaluate each borrowers credit strength and history, the characteristics of the loan and the value of the underlying property. Loan applications for flow mortgage insurance are either directly reviewed by us (or our contract underwriters), or as noted below, by lenders under delegated authority and in either case may utilize automated underwriting systems. A substantial number of our mortgage lender customers underwrite loan applications for mortgage insurance under a delegated underwriting program, in which we permit approved lenders to commit us to insure loans using our pre-approved underwriting guidelines, including credit scores. When underwriting bulk mortgage insurance transactions, we evaluate characteristics of the loans in the portfolio, including credit scores, and examine all or a sample of loan files. We set premiums at the time a certificate of insurance is issued based on our expectations regarding likely performance of a loan. Once a certificate of coverage is issued, we are not able to alter the premium charged or cancel coverage without cause. We continue to monitor current housing conditions and the performance of our books of business to determine if we need to make further changes in our pricing or underwriting guidelines and practices. 
 Fair Isaac Company (FICO) developed the FICO credit scoring model to calculate a score based upon a borrowers credit history. We use the FICO credit score as one indicator of a borrowers credit quality. Typically, a borrower with a higher credit score has a lower likelihood of defaulting on a loan. FICO credit scores range up to 850, with a score of 620 or more generally viewed as a prime loan and a score below 620 generally viewed as a sub-prime loan. A minus loans generally are loans where the borrowers have FICO credit scores between 575 and 660, and where the borrower has a blemished credit history. As of December 31, 2018, on a risk in-force basis and at the time of loan closing, approximately 99% of our primary insurance loans were prime in credit quality with FICO credit scores of at least 620. 
 Loss mitigation 
 Under our flow master policies, upon receipt of a valid claim we are generally required to pay the coverage percentage specified in the certificate of insurance and related expenses, but we also have the option to pay the lender an amount equal to the total unpaid loan principal (i.e., without applying the coverage percentage), delinquent interest and other expenses incurred with the default and foreclosure, and acquire title to the property. 
 
9 


  If a property is sold by the lender to a third party with our approval, the claim amount may be reduced or eliminated. We work closely with lenders who identify and monitor delinquent borrowers. When a delinquency cannot be cured through basic collections, we have the right to approve loan modifications and seek the cooperation of servicers in modifying the terms and conditions of delinquent mortgage loans so as to enable borrowers to stay in their home and avoid foreclosure, thereby potentially reducing our claims. We have granted loss mitigation delegation to servicers whereby they perform loss mitigation efforts on our behalf. Moreover, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureaus (CFPB) mortgage servicing rule obligates servicers to engage in loss mitigation efforts with a borrower prior to foreclosure. These efforts have traditionally involved loan modifications intended to enable qualified borrowers to make restructured loan payments or efforts to sell the property thereby potentially reducing claim amounts to us. 
 After a delinquency is reported to us, we review, and where appropriate conduct further investigations. Under our master policies, we may request specified documentation concerning the origination, closing and servicing of an insured loan. Failure to deliver required documentation or our review of such documentation may result in rescission, cancellation or claims curtailment or denial. We will consider an insureds appeal of our decision and if we agree with the appeal we take the necessary steps to reinstate uninterrupted insurance coverage and reactivate the loan certificate or otherwise address the issues raised in the appeal. If the parties are unable to agree on the outcome of the appeal, the insured may choose to pursue arbitration or litigation under the master policies and challenge the results. If arbitrated, ultimate resolution of the dispute would be pursuant to a panels binding arbitration award. Subject to applicable limitations in the master policies, legal challenges to our actions may be brought several years later. For additional information regarding our master policies, see RegulationU.S. Insurance RegulationPolicy forms. 
 From time to time, we enter into agreements with policyholders to accelerate claims and negotiate an agreed upon payment amount for claims on an identified group of delinquent loans. In exchange for our accelerated claim payment, mortgage insurance is cancelled and we are discharged from any further liability on the identified loans. 
 Distribution 
 We distribute our mortgage insurance products through our dedicated sales force throughout the United States. This sales force primarily markets to financial institutions and mortgage originators which impose a requirement for mortgage insurance as part of the borrowers financing. In addition to our field sales force, we also distribute our products through a telephone sales force serving our smaller lenders, as well as through our Action Center which provides live phone support for all customer segments. 
Competition 
 Our principal sources of competition are U.S. and state government agencies and other private mortgage insurers. We also compete with mortgage lenders and other investors, the GSEs, structured transactions in the capital markets, reinsurers and with other financial instruments designed to mitigate credit risk. 
 U.S. and state government agencies. We and other private mortgage insurers compete for flow mortgage insurance business directly with U.S. federal and state governmental and quasi-governmental agencies, principally the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). In addition to competition from the FHA and the VA, we and other private mortgage insurers face competition from certain local- and state-level housing finance agencies. 
 Private mortgage insurers. The U.S. private mortgage insurance industry remains highly competitive. There are currently six active mortgage insurers, including us. 
 Mortgage lenders, the GSEs, reinsurers and other participants in the mortgage finance industry. We have experienced competition in recent years from various participants in the mortgage finance industry including loan originators, the GSEs, investment banks and other purchasers of interests in mortgages as well as reinsurers and 
 
10 


  other participants in the capital markets. Competition from lenders has been in the form of self-insurance or origination of simultaneous second mortgages used to bring the loan-to-value ratio of a first mortgage below the level where mortgage insurance is required by the GSEs. The GSEs have continued to enter into risk sharing transactions with financial institutions other than mortgage insurers designed to reduce the risk of their mortgage portfolios partly in response to their conservator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). Third-party reinsurers have historically entered into transactions with mortgage insurers, including with our U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiaries, pursuant to which the third-party reinsurer assumes mortgage insurance risk for a fee. We may also compete with structured transactions in the capital markets and other financial instruments designed to mitigate the risk of mortgage defaults, such as credit default swaps and credit linked notes. 
 Canada Mortgage Insurance 
 We entered the Canadian mortgage insurance market in 1995 and operate in every province and territory. We are currently the leading private mortgage insurer in the Canadian market. 
 In July 2009, Genworth Canada, our indirect subsidiary, completed an initial public offering (IPO) of its common shares and we currently hold approximately 57.0% of the outstanding common shares of Genworth Canada on a consolidated basis, with GFIH holding 40.5% and our U.S. mortgage insurance business holding 16.5%. See note 23 in our consolidated financial statements under Part IIItem 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information. 
 Selected financial information and operating performance measures regarding our Canada Mortgage Insurance segment are included under Part IIItem 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsCanada Mortgage Insurance segment. 
 Products 
 Our main products are primary flow and bulk mortgage insurance. In both primary flow and bulk mortgage insurance, our mortgage insurance in Canada provides insurance coverage for 100% of the unpaid loan balance, including interest, selling costs and expenses. Regulations in Canada require the use of mortgage insurance for all high loan-to-value mortgage loans extended by federally incorporated banks, trust companies and insurers, where the loan-to-value ratio exceeds 80%. Most mortgage lenders in Canada offer both fixed rate and variable rate mortgages. High loan-to-value mortgages insured by our mortgage insurance business in Canada tend to be predominantly fixed rate mortgages of at least a five-year term, at the end of which the mortgages can be renewed. Most mortgage lenders in Canada offer a portability feature, which allows borrowers to transfer their original mortgage loan to a new property, subject to certain criteria. Our flow mortgage insurance policies contain a portability feature which allows borrowers to also transfer the mortgage default insurance associated with the mortgage loan. 
 We also provide bulk mortgage insurance to lenders that have originated loans with loan-to-value ratios of less than or equal to 80%. These policies provide lenders with immediate capital relief from applicable bank regulatory capital requirements and facilitate the securitization of mortgages in the Canadian market. 
 Government guarantee eligibility 
 We are subject to regulation under the Protection of Residential Mortgage or Hypothecary Insurance Act (Canada) (PRMHIA). Under the terms of PRMHIA, the Canadian government guarantees the benefits payable under a mortgage insurance policy, less 10% of the original principal amount of an insured loan, in the event that we fail to make claim payments with respect to that loan because of insolvency. We pay the Canadian government a risk fee for this guarantee. Because banks are not required to maintain regulatory capital on an asset backed by a sovereign guarantee, our 90% sovereign guarantee permits lenders purchasing our mortgage insurance to reduce their regulatory capital charges for credit risks on mortgages by 90%. Our primary government-sponsored competitor receives a 100% sovereign guarantee. The maximum outstanding insured 
 
11 


  exposure for private insured mortgages is CAD$350.0 billion, and the risk fee that we and other private mortgage insurers pay to the Canadian government is equal to 2.25% of gross premiums written. 
 Over the past several years, the Canadian government implemented a series of revisions to the rules for government guaranteed mortgages. We have incorporated these revisions into our underwriting guidelines. For more information about PRMHIA, see RegulationMortgage Insurance RegulationCanada regulation. 
 Underwriting and pricing 
 We review loan applications for all flow mortgage insurance loans we insure in Canada to evaluate each individual borrowers credit strength and history, the characteristics of the loan and the value of the underlying property. We evaluate the credit strength of a borrower by reviewing his or her credit history and credit score. We employ internal mortgage scoring models in the underwriting processes, as well as automated valuation models to evaluate property risk and fraud application prevention and management tools. When underwriting bulk mortgage insurance transactions, we evaluate characteristics of the loans in the portfolio and examine loan files on a sample basis. 
 Loan applications for flow mortgage insurance in Canada are processed through a system that analyzes the data based on pre-established criteria and systematically determines the approval status. Our employees manually review loans that do not meet the criteria for automated decisioning. We have established an audit plan to review underwritten loans to ensure that documentation supports the data provided by lenders. Our audit teams request and review samples (statistically valid and/or stratified) of performing loans. Once an audit review has been completed, our audit teams summarize and evaluate their findings against policy. If our audit teams detect non-compliance issues, we work with the lender to develop appropriate corrective actions. 
 We regularly evaluate our new business risk profile, which includes: reviewing underwriting guidelines, product restrictions and reducing new business in geographic areas we believe are more economically sensitive. We believe these underwriting actions have improved our performance on our more recent books of business. 
 Loss mitigation 
 In Canada, we work closely with lenders to identify and monitor delinquent borrowers. When a delinquency cannot be cured through basic collections, we work with the lender and, if permitted, with the borrower to identify an optimal loan workout solution. If it is determined that the borrower has the capacity to make a modified mortgage payment, we work with the lender to implement the most appropriate payment plan to address the borrowers hardship situation. If the borrower does not have the capacity to make payments on a modified loan, we work with the lender and borrower to sell the property at the best price to minimize the severity of our claim and provide the borrower with a reasonable resolution. We continue to execute a strategy to accelerate and facilitate the conveyance of real estate properties to us in selected circumstances. This strategy allows for better control of the remediation and marketing processes, reduction in carrying costs during the sale process and potential realization of a higher sales price with the cumulative impact being lower losses. 
 After a delinquency is reported to us, or after a claim is received, we review, and where appropriate conduct further investigations, to determine if there has been an event of underwriting non-compliance, non-disclosure of relevant information or any misrepresentation of information provided during the underwriting process. Our master policies provide that we may rescind coverage if there has been any failure to comply with agreed underwriting criteria or in the event of fraud or misrepresentation involving the lender or an agent of the lender. If such issues are identified, the claim or delinquent loan file is reviewed to determine the appropriate action, including potentially reducing the claim amount to be paid or rescinding the coverage. Generally, the issues we have initially identified are reviewed with the lender and the lender has an opportunity to provide further information or documentation to resolve the issue. Additionally, we may pursue recoveries from borrowers for paid claims within the time period permitted by law and use third-party collection agencies to assist in these recoveries.

 Distribution and customers 
 We maintain a dedicated sales force that markets our mortgage insurance products in Canada to lenders. Our sales force markets to financial institutions and mortgage originators, who in turn offer mortgage insurance products to borrowers. 
 Residential mortgage financing in Canada is concentrated in the countrys largest five banks and a limited number of other mortgage originators. The majority of our business in Canada comes from this group of residential mortgage originators. For example, two individual lender customers represented approximately 10% and 11% of total gross written premiums in our mortgage insurance business in Canada for the year ended December 31, 2018. No other lender customer accounted for 10% or more of gross written premiums in 2018. 
 Competition 
 Our primary mortgage insurance competitor in Canada is the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) which is owned by the Canadian government, although we currently have one other private competitor in the Canadian market. CMHCs mortgage insurance provides lenders with 100% capital relief from bank regulatory requirements. We compete with CMHC primarily based upon our reputation for high quality customer service, meeting customer service-level agreements for decision making on insurance applications, strong underwriting expertise and provision of support services. 
Australia Mortgage Insurance 
 We entered the Australian mortgage insurance market in 1997. In 2018, we were a leading provider of mortgage insurance in Australia based upon flow new insurance written. 
 In May 2014, Genworth Mortgage Insurance Australia Limited (Genworth Australia), a holding company for Genworths Australian mortgage insurance business, completed an IPO of its common shares and we currently beneficially own approximately 52.0% of the ordinary shares of Genworth Australia through our subsidiaries. See note 23 in our consolidated financial statements under Part IIItem 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information. 
 Selected financial information and operating performance measures regarding our Australia Mortgage Insurance segment are included under Part IIItem 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsAustralia Mortgage Insurance segment. 
 Products 
 In Australia, our main products are primary flow mortgage insurance, also known as lenders mortgage insurance (LMI), and bulk mortgage insurance, as well as structured insurance transactions where we provide excess of loss cover for bulk portfolios. LMI is similar to the single premium primary flow mortgage insurance we offer in Canada with 100% coverage. Residential mortgage loans in Australia are predominantly variable rate loans with 25 to 30 year terms. Lenders remit the single premium to us as the mortgage insurer following settlement of the loan and, generally, either collect the equivalent amount from the borrower at the time the loan proceeds are advanced or capitalize it in the loan. 
 Banks, building societies and credit unions generally acquire LMI only for residential mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios above 80%. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) makes and enforces the rules which govern authorized deposit-taking institutions (ADIs). APRA uses an application of international capital standards issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), which are collectively termed the Basel framework, that generally allow for reduced capital requirements for high loan-to-value residential mortgage loans if they have been insured by a mortgage insurance company regulated by APRA. APRAs application of the Basel framework for ADIs uses an internal ratings-based (IRB) approach in which the IRB models must be APRA approved. The IRB models may or may not allocate capital credit for LMI. We do not believe that the IRB ADIs currently benefit from an explicit reduction in their capital 
 
13 


  requirements for mortgage loans covered by mortgage insurance. We also believe that APRA and the IRB ADIs have not yet finalized internal models for residential mortgage risk. APRAs insurance authorization conditions require Australian mortgage insurance companies, including ours, to be monoline insurers, which are insurance companies that offer just one type of insurance product. 
 We also provide bulk mortgage insurance in Australia mainly to APRA-regulated lenders that intend to securitize Australian residential loans they have originated. Bulk mortgage insurance serves as an important source of credit enhancement for the Australian securitization market, and our bulk coverage is generally purchased for low loan-to-value, seasoned loans, and accounted for approximately 10% of new insurance written in our Australian mortgage insurance business for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
 Underwriting and pricing 
 Loan applications for all flow loans we insure in Australia are reviewed either by us or approved lenders under delegated underwriting authority to evaluate each individual borrowers credit strength and history, the characteristics of the loan and the value of the underlying property. Unlike in the United States where FICO credit scores are broadly used in evaluating a borrowers credit strength, standardized credit scores are not widely used in Australia. We employ internal scoring models in the underwriting process and use risk rules models to enhance the underwriters ability to evaluate the loan risk and make consistent underwriting decisions. Additional tools used by our mortgage insurance business in Australia include automated valuation models to evaluate property risk and fraud application prevention and management tools. When underwriting bulk mortgage insurance transactions, we evaluate characteristics of the loans in the portfolio and examine loan files on a sample basis. 
 Our delegated underwriting program, in which loan applications for flow mortgage insurance are reviewed by employees of qualified mortgage lender customers who underwrite loan applications for mortgage insurance, permits approved lenders to commit us to insure loans using underwriting guidelines we have previously approved. We have established an audit plan to review delegated underwritten loans to ensure compliance with the approved underwriting guidelines, operational procedures and master policy requirements. Our audit teams request and review samples (statistically valid and/or stratified) of performing loans. Once an audit review has been completed, our audit teams summarize and evaluate their findings against policy. If our audit teams detect non-compliance issues, we work with the lender to develop appropriate corrective actions. 
 We regularly take actions to reduce our new business risk profile, which include: reviewing underwriting guidelines, product restrictions, reducing new business in geographic areas we believe are more economically sensitive, and terminating commercial relationships as a result of weaker business performance. We have also increased prices for certain products based on periodic reviews of performance, with a focus on higher risk segments. We believe these underwriting and pricing actions have improved our performance on newer books of business. 
 Loss mitigation 
 In Australia, we work closely with lenders to identify and monitor delinquent borrowers. When a delinquency cannot be cured through basic collections, we work with the lender to identify an optimal loan workout solution. If it is determined that the borrower has the capacity to make a modified mortgage loan payment, we work with the lender to implement the most appropriate payment plan to address the borrowers hardship situation. If the borrower does not have the capacity to make payments on a modified loan, we work with the lender and borrower to sell the property at the best price to minimize the severity of our claim and provide the borrower with a reasonable resolution. 
 After a delinquency is reported to us, or after a claim is received, we review, and where appropriate conduct further investigations, to determine if there has been an event of underwriting non-compliance, non-disclosure of 
 
14 


  relevant information or any misrepresentation of information provided during the underwriting process. Our master policies provide that we may rescind coverage if there has been any failure to comply with agreed underwriting criteria or in the event of fraud or misrepresentation involving the lender or an agent of the lender. If such issues are identified, the claim or delinquent loan file is reviewed to determine the appropriate action, including potentially reducing the claim amount to be paid or rescinding the coverage. Generally, the issues we have initially identified are reviewed with the lender and the lender has an opportunity to provide further information or documentation to resolve the issue. 
 We may also review a group or portfolio of insured loans if we believe there may be systemic misrepresentations or non-compliance issues. If such issues are detected, we generally will work with the lender to develop an agreed settlement in respect of the group of loans so identified. Additionally, we may pursue recoveries from borrowers for paid claims within the time period permitted by law and use third-party collection agencies to assist in these recoveries. 
 Distribution and customers 
 We maintain a dedicated sales force that markets our mortgage insurance products in Australia to lenders. Our sales force markets to financial institutions and mortgage originators. 
 There is concentration among a small group of banks that write most of the residential mortgage loans in Australia. We maintain strong relationships within the major bank and regional bank channels, as well as building societies, credit unions and non-bank mortgage originators called mortgage managers. The four largest mortgage originators in Australia provide the majority of the financing for residential mortgages in that country. Our mortgage insurance business in Australia is concentrated in a small number of key customers. For instance, for the year ended December 31, 2018, our largest customer represented approximately 55% of gross written premiums. In November 2016, we entered into a new contract with our largest customer, effective January 1, 2017, with a term of three years. In November 2018, we entered into a new contract with our second largest customer, effective November 21, 2018, with a term of two years and the option to extend for an additional year at the customers discretion. This customer represented approximately 16% of our gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2018. No other customer represented 10% or more of gross written premiums in 2018. 
 These banks continue to evaluate the utilization of mortgage insurance in connection with the implementation of the bank capital standards in Australia based on the standards of the Basel Committee, and this could impact both the size of the private mortgage insurance market in Australia and our market share. The response of banks to the new capital standards will develop over time and this response could impact our Australian mortgage insurance business. 
 Competition 
 The Australian flow mortgage insurance market is primarily served by us and one other private mortgage insurance company, as well as certain lender-affiliated captive mortgage insurance companies. In addition, some lenders self-insure certain high loan-to-value mortgage risks. On January 17, 2019, APRA authorized a third private mortgage insurance company to conduct business in Australia. It is too early to determine the impact this additional competitor will have on our market share. 
 We compete primarily based upon our reputation for high quality customer service, meeting customer service-level agreements for decision making on insurance applications, strong underwriting expertise and flexibility in terms of product development and provision of support services. 
 U.S. Life Insurance 
 Through our U.S. Life Insurance segment, we offer long-term care insurance products. On March 7, 2016, we suspended sales of our traditional life insurance and fixed annuity products. While we no longer solicit sales of these products, we continue to service our existing retained and reinsured blocks of business. On April 1, 
 
15 


  2017, we acquired a North Carolina domiciled life insurance company, Securitas Financial Life Insurance Company, which we renamed Genworth Insurance Company, for a net purchase price of $5 million. During 2018 and 2017, we contributed capital of $6 million and $11 million, respectively, to this company. We plan to offer new long-term care solutions from this new life insurance company following the China Oceanwide transaction. 
 Selected financial information and operating performance measures regarding our U.S. Life Insurance segment are included under Part IIItem 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsU.S. Life Insurance segment. 
 Long-term care insurance 
 We established ourselves as a leader in long-term care insurance over 40 years ago and remain a leading insurer. We believe our experience, hedging strategies and reinsurance reduce some of the risks associated with these products. 
 Products 
 Our individual and group long-term care insurance products provide defined levels of protection against the significant costs of long-term care services provided in the insureds home or in assisted living or nursing facilities. In contrast to health insurance, long-term care insurance provides coverage for skilled and custodial care provided outside of a hospital or health-related facility. Despite our low sales levels in our long-term care insurance business given our current ratings, we continue to evaluate new products and market trends to meet consumer needs. 
Underwriting 
 We employ medical underwriting procedures to assess and quantify risks before we issue our individual long-term care insurance policies. Our group long-term care insurance product utilizes various underwriting processes, including modified guaranteed underwriting for actively at work employees and full medical underwriting for employees outside their enrollment window, retirees or others, including spouses of actively at work employees. We periodically review our underwriting requirements and have made, and may make changes to processes as needed. 
Pricing 
 We have accumulated extensive pricing and claims experience. The overall financial performance of our long-term care insurance business depends primarily on the accuracy of our pricing assumptions, including for morbidity and mortality experience, persistency and investment yields. Our claims database provides us with substantial data that has helped us develop pricing methodologies for our newer policies. We tailor pricing based on segmented risk categories, including couples, gender, medical history and other factors. Financial performance on older policies issued without the full benefit of this experience has been worse than initially assumed in pricing of those blocks. We continually monitor trends and developments and update assumptions that may affect the risk, pricing and profitability of our long-term care insurance products and adjust our new product pricing and other terms, as appropriate. We also work with medical advisors and health industry experts which provide insights on emerging morbidity and medical trends, enabling us to be more proactive in our risk segmentation, pricing and product development strategies. 
 
16 


 In-force rate actions 
 As part of our strategy for our long-term care insurance business, we have been implementing, and expect to continue to pursue, significant premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions on older generation blocks of business in order to bring those blocks closer to a break-even point over time and reduce the strain on earnings and capital. We are also requesting premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions on newer blocks of business, as needed, some of which may be significant, to help bring their loss ratios back towards their original pricing. For all of these in-force rate action filings, we received 120 filing approvals from 33 states in 2018, representing a weighted-average increase of 45% on approximately $875 million in annualized in-force premiums. We also submitted 97 new filings in 30 states in 2018 on approximately $848 million in annualized in-force premiums. 
 As of December 31, 2018, we have suspended sales in Hawaii, Massachusetts, Montana, New Hampshire and Vermont, and will consider taking similar actions in the future in other states where we are unable to obtain satisfactory rate increases on in-force policies and/or unable to obtain approval for new products. We will also consider litigation against states that decline actuarially justified rate increases. As of December 31, 2018, we were in litigation with one state that has refused to approve actuarially justified in-force rate actions. 
 The approval process for in-force premium rate increases and the amount and timing of the rate increases approved vary by state. In certain states, the decision to approve or disapprove a rate increase can take several years. Upon approval, insureds are provided with written notice of the increase and increases are generally applied on the insureds next policy anniversary date. As a result, the benefits of any in-force rate increase are not fully realized until the implementation cycle is complete and are, therefore, expected to be realized over time. For certain risks related to our long-term care insurance premiums and in-force rate increases, see Item 1ARisk FactorsOur financial condition, results of operations, long-term care insurance products and/or our reputation in the market may be adversely affected if we are not able to increase premiums and associated benefit reductions on our in-force long-term care insurance policies by enough or quickly enough; and the increased premiums or associated benefit reductions currently being implemented, as well as any future in-force rate actions, may lower product demand. 
 Distribution 
 Currently, we distribute our products primarily through appointed independent producers and employer groups. We work to develop existing relationships with select distribution partners whose priorities closely align with ours. Additionally, we intend to focus on forming new partnerships that may incrementally expand our customer reach, especially to those in the middle market. Across all channels, we expect to prioritize closer relationships with consumers. 
 Our lower ratings from rating agency actions have resulted in distributor suspensions. We expect that our sales will continue to be adversely impacted by our current ratings. Future adverse ratings announcements or actions could further negatively impact our sales levels. 
 Competition 
 Competition in the long-term care insurance industry is primarily from a limited number of insurance companies. Our products compete by providing consumers with an array of long-term care coverage solutions. A broad set of insurers compete in the combination product market whereby they offer life insurance products with riders that accelerate or enhance benefits based upon a long-term care need, and other combination products. We expect that continued changes in the competitive landscape of the long-term care insurance market as well as our financial strength ratings will continue to impact our sales levels.

 Life insurance 
 Life insurance products provide protection against financial hardship after the death of an insured. Some of these products also offer a savings element that can help accumulate funds to meet future financial needs. We previously sold traditional life insurance product offerings including universal and term life insurance. We also previously sold an index universal life insurance product and linked-benefit products, combining a universal life insurance contract with a long-term care insurance rider. We continue to hold in-force blocks of these products, as well as in-force blocks of term universal life and whole life insurance. 
 Fixed annuities 
 Fixed annuity products help individuals create dependable income streams for life or for a specified period of time and help them save and invest to achieve financial goals. We previously sold traditional fixed annuity product offerings, including single premium deferred annuities, single premium immediate annuities and structured settlements. We continue to hold in-force blocks of these products. 
 Single premium deferred annuities 
 Fixed single premium deferred annuities require a single premium payment at time of issue and provide an accumulation period and an annuity payout period. The annuity payout period in these products may be either a defined number of years, the annuitants lifetime or the longer of a defined number of years and the annuitants lifetime. During the accumulation period, we credit the account value of the annuity with interest earned at a crediting rate guaranteed for no less than one year at issue, but which may be guaranteed for up to seven years, and thereafter is subject to annual crediting rate resets at our discretion. The crediting rate is based upon many factors including prevailing market rates, spreads and targeted returns, subject to statutory and contractual minimums. The majority of our fixed single premium deferred annuity contractholders retain their contracts for five to ten years. 
 Fixed indexed annuities have been part of our product suite of single premium deferred annuities. Fixed indexed annuities provide an annual crediting rate that is based on the performance of a defined external index rather than a rate that is declared by the insurance company. The external indices we use are the S&P 500® and the Barclays U.S. Low Volatility ER II Index. Our fixed indexed annuity product also may provide guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (GMWBs). 
 Single premium immediate annuities 
 Single premium immediate annuities provide a fixed amount of income for either a defined number of years, the annuitants lifetime or the longer of a defined number of years and the annuitants lifetime in exchange for a single premium. 
 Structured settlements 
 Structured settlement annuity contracts provide an alternative to a lump sum settlement, generally in a personal injury lawsuit or workers compensation claim, and typically are purchased by property and casualty insurance companies for the benefit of an injured claimant. The structured settlements provide scheduled payments over a fixed period or, in the case of a life-contingent structured settlement, for the life of the claimant with a guaranteed minimum period of payments. 
 Runoff 
 The Runoff segment includes the results of non-strategic products which have not been actively sold since 2011 but we continue to service our existing blocks of business. Our non-strategic products primarily include variable annuity, variable life insurance, institutional, corporate-owned life insurance and other accident and health insurance products. Institutional products consist of funding agreements and funding agreements backing notes (FABNs).

 Selected financial information and operating performance measures regarding our Runoff segment are included under Part IIItem 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsRunoff segment. 
 Products 
 Variable annuities and variable life insurance 
 Our variable annuities provide contractholders the ability to allocate purchase payments and contract value to underlying investment options available in a separate account format. The contractholder bears the risk associated with the performance of investments in the separate account. In addition, some of our variable annuities permit customers to allocate assets to a guaranteed interest account managed within our general account. Certain of our variable annuity products provide contractholders with lifetime guaranteed income benefits. Our variable annuity products generally provide guaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDBs) and may provide GMWBs and certain types of guaranteed annuitization benefits. 
 Variable annuities generally provide us fees including mortality and expense risk charges and, in some cases, administrative charges. The fees equal a percentage of the contractholders policy account value or related benefit base value, and as of December 31, 2018, ranged from 0.75% to 4.20% per annum depending on the features and options within a contract. 
 Our variable annuity contracts with a basic GMDB provide a minimum benefit to be paid upon the annuitants death, usually equal to the larger of the annuitants account value or the amount of net deposits. Some contractholders also have riders that provide enhanced death benefits. Assuming every annuitant died on December 31, 2018, as of that date, contracts with death benefit features not covered by reinsurance had an account value of $3,907 million and a related death benefit exposure, or net amount at risk, of $209 million. 
 Some of our variable annuity products provide the contractholder with a guaranteed minimum income stream that they cannot outlive, along with an opportunity to participate in market appreciation. 
 We no longer solicit sales of our variable annuity or variable life insurance products; however, we continue to service our existing block of business and accept deposits on existing contracts and policies. 
 Institutional 
 Our institutional products consist of funding agreements and FABNs, deposit-type contracts that allow funds to accumulate at a guaranteed rate of return over a specified period of time. We explore periodic issuance of our institutional products for asset-liability management and liquidity purposes. 
 Corporate-owned life insurance 
 We no longer offer our corporate-owned life insurance product; however, we continue to manage our existing block of business. 
 Other accident and health insurance 
 Our other accident and health insurance includes Medicare supplement insurance reinsured to a third party, and certain disability, accident and health insurance that we no longer sell but continue to manage our existing block of business. 
 Corporate and Other Activities 
 Our Corporate and Other activities include debt financing expenses that are incurred at the Genworth Holdings level, unallocated corporate income and expenses, eliminations of inter-segment transactions and the results of other businesses that are managed outside our operating segments, including certain smaller 
 
19 


  international mortgage insurance businesses and discontinued operations. We have a presence in the private mortgage insurance market in Mexico and maintained a license in South Korea through the end of 2017. In January 2018, we terminated our license in South Korea. We are also a minority shareholder of a joint venture partnership in India that offers mortgage guarantees against borrower defaults on housing loans from mortgage lenders in India. The financial impact of this joint venture was minimal during 2018, 2017 and 2016. 
 Corporate and Other activities also previously included our mortgage insurance businesses in Europe. On May 9, 2016, Genworth Mortgage Insurance Corporation (GMICO) completed the sale of our European mortgage insurance business to AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. and received net proceeds of approximately $50 million. See note 24 in our consolidated financial statements under Part IIItem 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information. 
 On December 1, 2015, we sold our lifestyle protection insurance business to AXA for approximately $493 million. This business was accounted for as discontinued operations and its financial position, results of operations and cash flows were separately reported for all periods presented. We received net proceeds of approximately $400 million from the sale. See note 24 in our consolidated financial statements under Part IIItem 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information. 
 Selected financial information regarding our Corporate and Other activities is included under Part IIItem 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsCorporate and Other activities. 
 International Operations 
 Our total revenues attributed to international operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were approximately $1.0 billion, $0.7 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. More information regarding our international operations and revenue in our largest countries is presented in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements under Part IIItem 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
Risk Management 
 Risk management is a critical part of our business. We have an enterprise risk management framework that includes risk management processes relating to economic capital analysis, strategic initiatives, product development and pricing, management of in-force business, including certain mitigating strategies and claims risk management, credit risk management, asset-liability management, liquidity management, investment activities, model risk management, portfolio diversification, underwriting and loss mitigation, financial databases and information systems, information technology risk management, data security and cybersecurity, business acquisitions and dispositions, operational risk assessment capabilities and overall operational risk management. 
 We have identified the following as the most significant risk types to our business: credit risk, market risk, insurance risk, housing risk, operational risk, model risk and information technology risk. Related to these identified risk types, we have classified our top risks and frequently report those risks to both senior management and the risk committee of our Board of Directors. In addition, we have developed a process to identify and manage emerging risks and developed a model that seeks to quantify and calibrate all risks in their event of probability. 
 Our risk management framework includes seven key components: risk type key attributes (to ensure full coverage); identification of risk exposures to identify top risks; business strategy and planning; governance; risk quantification (both qualitative and quantitative); risk appetite; and stress testing. Our risk management framework also includes an assessment and implementation of company and business risk appetites, the identification and assessment of risks, a proactive decision process to determine which risks are acceptable to be 
 
20 


  retained (based on risk and reward considerations, among other factors) and the ongoing management, monitoring and reporting of material risks. 
 Our risk management practices are an important component in the management of our legacy long-term care insurance in-force blocks of business. We continue to pursue significant premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions on our older generation long-term care insurance in-force block. In support of this initiative, we have developed processes that include experience studies to analyze emerging experience, reviews of in-force product performance, overviews of assumption review processes, and comprehensive monitoring and reporting. In connection with these processes, our risk management team works closely with the U.S. life insurance business to enhance proper governance and to better align the development of assumptions with the identified risks. 
 As part of our evaluation of overall in-force product performance, new product initiatives and risk mitigation alternatives, we monitor regulatory and rating agency capital models as well as internal economic capital models to determine the appropriate level of risk-adjusted capital required. We utilize our internal economic capital model to assess the risk of loss to our capital resources based upon the portfolio of risks we underwrite and retain and upon our asset and operational risk profiles. Our commitment to risk management involves the ongoing review and expansion of internal risk management capabilities with a focus on improving infrastructure and modeling. 
 Product development and management 
 Our risk management process includes the development and introduction of new products and services. We have established a product development process that specifies a series of required analyses, reviews and approvals for any new product. For each proposed product, this process includes a review of the market opportunity and competitive landscape, major pricing assumptions and methodologies, return expectations and variability of returns, sensitivity analysis, asset-liability management, reinsurance and other risk mitigating strategies, underwriting criteria, legal, compliance and business risks and potential mitigating actions. Before we introduce a new product, we establish a monitoring program with specific performance targets and leading indicators, which we monitor frequently to identify any deviations from expected performance so that we can take corrective action if necessary. Significant product introductions, measured either by volume, level or type of risk, require approval by our senior management team at either the business or enterprise level. 
 We use a similar process to introduce changes to existing products and to offer existing products in new markets and through new distribution channels. Product performance reviews include an analysis of the major drivers of profitability, underwriting performance and variations from expected results, including an in-depth experience analysis of the products major risk factors. Other areas of focus include the regulatory and competitive environments and other emerging factors that may affect product performance. 
 In addition, we initiate special reviews when a products performance fails to meet the indicators we established during that products introductory review process for subsequent reviews of in-force blocks of business. If a product does not meet our performance criteria, we consider adjustments in pricing, design and marketing or ultimately discontinuing sales of that product. We review our underwriting, pricing, distribution and risk selection strategies on a regular basis in an effort to ensure that our products remain competitive and consistent with our marketing and profitability objectives. For example, in our mortgage insurance businesses, we review the profitability of lender accounts to assess whether our business with these lenders is achieving anticipated performance levels and to identify trends requiring remedial action, including changes to underwriting guidelines, product mix or other customer performance. We adhere to risk management disciplines and aim to leverage these efforts in our distribution and management of our products. 
 
21 


 Asset-liability management 
 We maintain segmented investment portfolios for the majority of our product lines. This enables us to perform an ongoing analysis of the interest rate, foreign exchange, equity, volatility and liquidity risks associated with each major product line, in addition to credit risks for our overall enterprise versus approved limits. We analyze the behavior of our liability cash flows across a wide variety of scenarios, reflecting policy features and expected policyholder behavior. Similarly, we analyze the potential cash flow variability of our asset portfolios across a wide variety of scenarios. We believe this analysis shows the sensitivity of both our assets and liabilities to changes in economic environments and enables us to manage our assets and liabilities more effectively, including but not limited to, investing in assets that have maturities that align more closely with our longer duration liabilities. In addition, we deploy hedging programs to mitigate certain economic risks associated with our assets, liabilities and capital. For example, we partially hedge the equity, interest rate and market volatility risks in our variable annuity products, as well as interest rate risks in our long-term care insurance products. 
 Liquidity management 
 We monitor the cash and highly marketable investment positions in each of our operating companies against operating targets that are designed to ensure that we will have the cash necessary to meet our obligations as they come due. The targets are set based on stress scenarios that have the effect of increasing our expected cash outflows and decreasing our expected cash inflows. In addition, we monitor the ability of our operating companies to provide the dividends needed to meet the cash needs of our holding companies and analyze the impact of reduced dividend levels and other potential factors under stress scenarios that may impact the liquidity priorities of our holding companies, in particular Genworth Holdings (the holder of our outstanding debt). 
 Portfolio diversification and investments 
 We use new business and in-force product limits to manage our risk concentrations and to manage product, business level, geographic and other risk exposures. We manage unique product exposures in our business segments. For example, in managing our mortgage insurance risk exposure, we monitor geographic concentrations in our portfolio and the condition of housing markets in each major area in the countries in which we operate. We also monitor fundamental price indicators and factors that affect home prices and their affordability at the national and regional levels. 
 In addition, our assets are managed within limitations to control credit risk and to avoid excessive concentration in our investment portfolio using defined investment and concentration guidelines that help ensure disciplined underwriting and oversight standards. We seek diversification in our investment portfolio by investing in multiple asset classes and limiting size of exposures. The portfolios are tailored to match, as closely as possible, the cash flow characteristics of our liabilities. We actively monitor exposures, changes in credit characteristics and shifts in markets. 
 We utilize surveillance and quantitative credit risk analytics to identify concentrations and drive diversification of portfolio risks with respect to issuer, sector, rating and geographic concentration. Issuer credit limits for the investment portfolios of each of our businesses (based on business capital, portfolio size and relative issuer cumulative default risk) govern and control credit concentrations in our portfolio. Derivatives counterparty risk and reinsurer credit exposure are integrated into issuer limits as well. We also limit and actively monitor country and sovereign exposures in our global portfolio and evaluate and adjust our risk profiles, where needed, in response to geopolitical and economic developments in the relevant areas. 
 Underwriting and loss mitigation 
 Underwriting guidelines for all products are routinely reviewed and adjusted as necessary with the aim of providing policyholders with the appropriate premium and benefit structure. We have separate underwriting units in our businesses that develop ongoing processes to assess the effectiveness of underwriting guidelines against 
 
22 


  original pricing assumptions and any impacts to actual product performance and profitability. We seek external reviews from the reinsurance and consulting communities and utilize their experience to calibrate our risk taking to expected outcomes. 
 Our risk and loss mitigation activities include ensuring that new policies are issued based on accurate information and policy benefit payments are paid in accordance with the policy contract terms. We also have quality assurance programs that test policies and products to assess whether established underwriting guidelines are followed. 
 Financial databases and information systems 
 Our financial databases and information systems technology are important tools in our risk management. For example, we have substantial experience in offering long-term care and individual life insurance products with large databases of claims experience. We have extensive data on the performance of mortgage originations in the United States and other major markets we operate in which we use to assess the drivers and distributions of delinquency and claims experience. 
 We use technology, in some cases proprietary technology, to manage variations in our underwriting process. For example, in our mortgage insurance businesses, we use borrower credit bureau information, proprietary mortgage scoring models and/or our extensive database of mortgage insurance experience along with external data including rating agency data to evaluate new products and portfolio performance. In the United States and Canada, our proprietary mortgage scoring models use the borrowers credit score and additional data concerning the borrower, the loan and the property, including but not limited to: loan-to-value ratio; loan type; loan amount; property type; occupancy status and borrower employment, to predict the likelihood of having to pay a claim. In addition, our models take into consideration macroeconomic variables such as unemployment, interest rate and home price changes. We believe assessing housing market and mortgage loan attributes across a range of economic outcomes enhances our ability to manage and price for risk. We perform portfolio analysis on an ongoing basis to determine if modifications are required to our product offerings, underwriting guidelines or premium rates. 
 Model risk management 
 We rely extensively on complex models to calculate the value of assets and liabilities (including reserves), capital levels and other financial metrics, as well as for other purposes. We have a model risk management framework in place that is designed to ensure model risks are appropriately identified, appropriate governance is in place, key models are maintained, model validation programs exist (that include relevant model issues and remediation plans, if necessary) and model risk is reported to management and our Board of Directors on a timely basis. Independent model validation teams assess on a systematic basis the appropriate use of models, taking into account the risks associated with assumptions, algorithms and process controls supporting the use of the models. See Item 1ARisk FactorsIf the models used in our businesses are inaccurate or there are differences and/or variability in loss development compared to our model estimates and actuarial assumptions, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Business dispositions 
 When we consider a disposition of a block/book of business or entity, we use various business, financial and risk management disciplines to evaluate the merits of the proposals and assess its strategic fit with our current business model. We have a review process that includes a series of required analyses, reviews and approvals similar to those employed for new product introductions. For additional information on potential sales of assets and/or businesses, see Item 1BusinessStrategic UpdateStrategic Alternatives.

 Operational risk management 
 We have risk management programs in place to review the ongoing operation of our businesses in the event of loss or other adverse consequences on business outcomes resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. We provide risk assessments, together with control reviews, to provide an indication as to how the risks need to be managed. Significant events impacting our businesses are assessed in terms of their impact on our risk profile. Controls are used to mitigate or minimize the consequence of the risk if it did occur. Investigative teams are maintained in our various locations to address potential operational risk incidents from both internal and external sources. 
 Information technology risk management 
 Technology continues to expand and plays an ever increasing role in our business. To help mitigate some of the rising levels of risk, in 2018 we identified information technology risk management as a separate risk type and have dedicated more time and resources to this risk area. We have established an independent risk profile for information technology and routinely report our assessments to the risk committee of our Board of Directors. Our internal audit department works closely with our risk management team on audit planning, audit findings and overall adherence to our information technology programs and procedures. This collaborative effort seeks to mitigate some of the growing threats in our information technology environment. 
 Information security 
 Technology plays a critical role in our business operations. To protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our technology infrastructure and information, we leverage the operational risk and technology risk management programs to identify, monitor and manage risk. 
 Information security involves the protection of information assets against unacceptable risks and cybersecurity threats. Information assets include both information itself in the form of computer data, written materials, knowledge and supporting processes, and the information technology systems, networks, other electronic devices and storage media used to store, process, retrieve and transmit that information. These information assets play a vital role in our business conduct. As more information is used and shared by our employees, customers and suppliers, both within and outside our company, a concerted effort must be made to protect that information. Confidentiality, integrity and availability of information are essential to maintaining our reputation, legal position and ability to conduct our operations. We strive to adhere to high standards of information security governance, treating information security as a critical business issue and creating a security-conscious environment. We also strive to demonstrate to our customers and third parties that we deal with information security in a proactive manner and apply fundamental principles, such as assuming ultimate responsibility for information security, implementing controls and cybersecurity programs that are proportionate to risk. We have attempted to design our cybersecurity program to protect and preserve the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data and systems, although there can be no guarantees to the success of our cybersecurity program. See Item 1ARisk FactorsOur computer systems may fail or be compromised, and unanticipated problems could materially adversely impact our disaster recovery systems and business continuity plans, which could damage our reputation, impair our ability to conduct business effectively and materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of the risks relating to information security. 
 Operations and Technology 
 Service and support 
 In our mortgage insurance businesses, we have introduced technology enabled services to help our customers (lenders and servicers) as well as our consumers (borrowers and homeowners). Technology advancements have allowed us to reduce application approval turn-times, error rates and enhance our customers ease of doing business with us. Through our secure internet-enabled information systems and data warehouses, servicers can transact business with us in a timely manner. In the United States, proprietary decision models have 
 
24 


  helped generate loss mitigation strategies for distressed borrowers. Our models use information from various third-party sources, such as consumer credit agencies, to indicate borrower willingness and capacity to fulfill debt obligations. Identification of specific borrower groups that are likely to work their loans out allows us to create custom outreach strategies to achieve a favorable loss mitigation outcome.
 Operating centers 
 We have established scalable, low-cost operating centers in Virginia and North Carolina. In addition, through an arrangement with an outsourcing provider, we have a team of professionals in India and the Philippines who provide a variety of services primarily to our U.S. life insurance businesses and certain corporate functions, including data entry, transaction processing and functional support. 
 Reinsurance 
 We reinsure a portion of our annuity, life insurance, long-term care insurance and mortgage insurance with unaffiliated reinsurers. In a reinsurance transaction, a reinsurer agrees to indemnify another insurer for part or all of its liability under a policy or policies it has issued for an agreed upon premium. We participate in reinsurance activities in order to minimize exposure to significant risks, limit losses, and provide additional capacity for future growth. We also obtain reinsurance to meet certain capital requirements, including sometimes utilizing intercompany reinsurance agreements to manage our statutory capital positions. However, these intercompany agreements do not have an effect on our consolidated U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) financial statements. 
 We enter into various agreements with reinsurers that cover individual risks, group risks or defined blocks of business, primarily on a coinsurance, yearly renewable term, excess of loss or catastrophe excess basis. These reinsurance agreements spread risk and minimize the effect of losses. For example, in addition to reinsuring mortality risk on our life insurance products, we have executed external reinsurance agreements to reinsure 20% of all sales of our individual long-term care insurance products that have been introduced since early 2013. The extent of each risk retained by us depends on our evaluation of the specific risk, subject, in certain circumstances, to maximum retention limits based on the characteristics of coverages. 
 Under the terms of the reinsurance agreements, the reinsurer agrees to reimburse us for the ceded amount in the event a claim is paid. Cessions under reinsurance agreements do not discharge our obligations as the primary insurer. In the event that reinsurers do not meet their obligations under the terms of the reinsurance agreements, reinsurance recoverable balances could become uncollectible. Our amounts recoverable from reinsurers represent receivables from and/or reserves ceded to reinsurers. The amounts recoverable from reinsurers were $17.3 billion and $17.6 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
 We focus on obtaining reinsurance from a diverse group of reinsurers. We regularly evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers and monitor concentration risk with our reinsurers at least annually. Our U.S. life insurance subsidiaries have established standards and criteria for our use and selection of reinsurers. In order for a new reinsurer to participate in our current program, without collateralization, we require the reinsurer to have a Standard & Poors Financial Services, LLCs (S&P) rating of A- or better or a Moodys Investors Service, Inc. (Moodys) rating of A3 or better and a minimum capital and surplus level of $350 million. If the reinsurer does not have these ratings, we generally require them to post collateral as described below. In addition, we may require collateral from a reinsurer to mitigate credit/collectability risk. Typically, in such cases, the reinsurer must either maintain minimum specified ratings and risk-based capital (RBC) ratios or provide the specified quality and quantity of collateral. Similarly, we have also required collateral in connection with books of business sold pursuant to indemnity reinsurance agreements. We have been required to post collateral when purchasing books of business. 
 Reinsurers that are not licensed, accredited or authorized in the state of domicile of the reinsured (ceding company) are required to post statutorily prescribed forms of collateral for the ceding company to receive 
 
25 


  reinsurance credit. The three primary forms of collateral are: (i) qualifying assets held in a reserve credit trust; (ii) irrevocable, unconditional, evergreen letters of credit issued by a qualified U.S. financial institution; and (iii) assets held by the ceding company in a segregated funds withheld account. Collateral must be maintained in accordance with the rules of the ceding companys state of domicile and must be readily accessible by the ceding company to cover claims under the reinsurance agreement. Accordingly, our U.S. life insurance subsidiaries require unauthorized reinsurers that are not so licensed, accredited or authorized to post acceptable forms of collateral to support their reinsurance obligations to us. 
 On September 22, 2017, U.S. federal authorities signed a covered agreement with the European Union (EU), on matters including reinsurance collateral. This agreement requires U.S. states to adopt, within five years from the execution of the covered agreement, laws removing reinsurance collateral requirements for reinsurance ceded to a qualifying non-U.S. reinsurer domiciled in an EU jurisdiction. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the NAIC) is currently revising the Credit for Reinsurance Model Law and Model Regulation in order to bring them into compliance with the terms of the covered agreement. Additionally, in late December 2018, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative entered into a covered agreement with the U.K., which will extend the benefits of the U.S., EU covered agreement to the U.K. after the withdrawal of the U.K. from the EU, commonly known as Brexit. We cannot currently predict the impact of these changes to the law or whether any other covered agreements will be successfully adopted, and cannot currently estimate the impact of these changes to the law and any such adopted covered agreements on our business, financial condition or operating results. 
 The following table sets forth our exposure to our principal reinsurers in our U.S. life insurance subsidiaries as of December 31, 2018: 
 

(Amounts in millions) | Reinsurancerecoverable | 
UFLIC (1) | $ | 13,975
RGA Reinsurance Company | $ | 1,423 
Riversource Life Insurance Company | $ | 458 
General Re Life Corporation | $ | 458 
Munich American Reassurance Company | $ | 435 


(1) | We have several significant reinsurance transactions with Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC), an affiliate of our former parent, General Electric Company (GE), which results in a significant concentration of reinsurance risk. UFLICs obligations to us are secured by trust accounts. See note 8 in our consolidated financial statements under Part IIItem 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We reinsure a portion of our U.S. mortgage insurance risk in order to obtain credit towards the financial requirements of the private mortgage insurer eligibility requirements (PMIERs). Reinsurance transactions provided an aggregate of approximately $515 million of PMIERs capital credit as of December 31, 2018. The reinsurance coverage is provided by a panel of reinsurance partners each currently rated A- or better by S&P or A.M. Best Company, Inc. (A.M. Best). The transactions are structured as excess of loss coverage where both the attachment and detachment points of the ceded risk tier are within the PMIERs capital requirements at inception. Each reinsurance treaty has a term of 10 years and grants to Genworth a unilateral right to commute prior to the full term, subject to certain performance triggers. 
 In our mortgage insurance business in Australia, all of the reinsurance treaties that cover its flow insurance business are on an excess of loss basis that are designed to attach only under stress loss events and are renewable (with the agreement of both us and the relevant reinsurers) on a periodic basis. As of December 31, 2018, our Australian mortgage insurance business had five excess of loss treaties, all with a one year base term with options to extend for five to nine years, with an aggregate coverage limit of AUD$800 million. This coverage is provided by approximately 20 reinsurance partners, each currently rated A- or better by S&P and/or A.M. Best. 
 
26 


  All of the treaties qualify for full capital credit offset within APRAs regulatory capital requirements. In early 2018, our mortgage insurance business in Australia also obtained reinsurance on a quota-share basis for a structured insurance transaction where it is in a secondary loss position. 
 For additional information related to reinsurance, see note 8 in our consolidated financial statements under Part IIItem 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
 Financial Strength Ratings 
 Ratings with respect to the financial strength of operating subsidiaries are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in us and our ability to market our products. Rating organizations review the financial performance and condition of most insurers and provide opinions regarding financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet obligations to policyholders. 
 As of February 14, 2019, our principal mortgage insurance subsidiaries were rated in terms of financial strength by S&P, Moodys and Dominion Bond Rating Service (DBRS) as follows: 
 

Company | S&P rating | Moodys rating | DBRS rating 
Genworth Mortgage Insurance Corporation | BB+ (Marginal) | Ba1 (Questionable) | Not rated 
Genworth Financial Mortgage Insurance Company Canada | A+ (Strong) | Not rated | AA (Superior)
Genworth Financial Mortgage Insurance Pty Limited (Australia) (1) | A+ (Strong) | Baa1 (Adequate) | Not rated 


(1) | Also rated A+ by Fitch Ratings (Fitch).
----+--------------------------------------------

 As of February 14, 2019, our principal life insurance subsidiaries were rated in terms of financial strength by S&P, Moodys and A.M. Best as follows: 
 

Company | S&P rating | Moodys rating | A.M. Bestrating
Genworth Life Insurance Company | B- (Weak) | B3 (Poor) | B- (Fair) 
Genworth Life and Annuity Insurance Company | B- (Weak) | Ba3 (Questionable) | B+ (Good) 
Genworth Life Insurance Company of New York | B- (Weak) | B3 (Poor) | B- (Fair) 

 The S&P, Moodys, DBRS and A.M. Best financial strength ratings of our operating companies are not designed to be, and do not serve as, measures of protection or valuation offered to investors. These financial strength ratings should not be relied on with respect to making an investment in our securities. 
 S&P states that insurers rated A (Strong), BB (Marginal) or B (Weak) have strong, marginal or weak financial security characteristics, respectively. The A, BB and B ranges are the third-, fifth- and sixth-highest of nine financial strength rating ranges assigned by S&P, which range from AAA to R. A plus (+) or minus (-) shows relative standing within a major rating category. These suffixes are not added to ratings in the AAA category or to ratings below the CCC category. Accordingly, the A+, BB+ and B- ratings are the fifth-, eleventh- and sixteenth-highest of S&Ps 21 ratings categories. 
 Moodys states that insurance companies rated Baa (Adequate) offer adequate financial security and that insurance companies rated Ba (Questionable) or B (Poor) offer questionable financial security. The Baa (Adequate), Ba (Questionable) and B (Poor) ranges are the fourth-, fifth- and sixth-highest, respectively, of nine financial strength rating ranges assigned by Moodys, which range from Aaa to C. Numeric modifiers are used to refer to the ranking within the group, with 1 being the highest and 3 being the lowest. These modifiers are not added to ratings in the Aaa category or to ratings below the Caa category. Accordingly, the Baa1, Ba1, Ba3 and B3 ratings are the eighth-, eleventh-, thirteenth- and sixteenth-highest, respectively, of Moodys 21 ratings categories. 
 
27 


 DBRS states that long-term obligations rated AA are of superior credit quality. The capacity for the payment of financial obligations is considered high and unlikely to be significantly vulnerable to future events. Credit quality differs from AAA only to a small degree. On July 21, 2017, DBRS confirmed the financial strength rating of Genworth Financial Mortgage Insurance Company Canada at AA (Superior). The financial strength rating confirmation reflects the companys market position, insurance portfolio and risk analytics, as well as its capital position relative to the capital required to meet insurance claim obligations. 
 A.M. Best states that the B+ (Good) rating is assigned to those companies that have, in its opinion, a good ability to meet their ongoing insurance obligations while B- (Fair) is assigned to those companies that have, in its opinion, a fair ability to meet their ongoing insurance obligations. The B+ (Good) and B- (Fair) ratings are the sixth- and eighth-highest of 15 ratings assigned by A.M. Best, which range from A++ to F. 
 We also solicit a rating from Fitch for our Australian mortgage insurance subsidiary. Fitch states that A (Strong) rated insurance companies are viewed as possessing strong capacity to meet policyholder and contract obligations. The A rating category is the third-highest of nine financial strength rating categories, which range from AAA to C. The symbol (+) or (-) may be appended to a rating to indicate the relative position of a credit within a rating category. These suffixes are not added to ratings in the AAA category or to ratings below the B category. Accordingly, the A+ rating is the fifth-highest of Fitchs 21 ratings categories. 
 We also solicit a rating from HR Ratings on a local scale for Genworth Seguros de Credito a la Vivienda S.A. de C.V., our Mexican mortgage insurance subsidiary, with a short-term rating of HR1 and long-term rating of HR AA. For short-term ratings, HR Ratings states that HR1 rated companies are viewed as exhibiting high capacity for timely payment of debt obligations in the short-term and maintain low credit risk. The HR1 short-term rating category is the highest of six short-term rating categories, which range from HR1 to HR D. For long-term ratings, HR Ratings states that HR AA rated companies are viewed as having high credit quality and offer high safety for timely payment of debt obligations and maintain low credit risk under adverse economic scenarios. The HR AA long-term rating is the second-highest of HR Ratings eight long-term rating categories, which range from HR AAA to HR D. 
 Ratings actions 
 On February 13, 2019, Moodys affirmed the unsecured debt rating of Genworth Holdings and maintained a negative outlook. In addition, Moodys placed our principal life insurance subsidiaries, GLIC, GLICNY and GLAIC under review for downgrade. Moodys actions were based upon liquidity concerns at Genworth Holdings and our ability to service debt maturities given our current cash and liquid asset position, along with our modest dividend capacity in relation to our overall debt obligations. Moodys actions were also based on our long-term care and life insurance business results in the fourth quarter of 2018, which included higher than expected operating losses due mostly to our annual assumption reviews, and due to further delays in obtaining regulatory approvals in connection with the completion of the China Oceanwide transaction. 
 On September 26, 2018, S&P downgraded the financial strength rating of our principal life insurance subsidiaries, GLIC, GLICNY and GLAIC, from B+ (Weak) to B- (Weak). S&P also revised the CreditWatch status of Genworth Financial, Genworth Holdings and GMICO from negative implications to developing. S&Ps rating actions were based mostly on their negative view of the creditworthiness of our holding companies and principal life insurance subsidiaries, whereas the revised CreditWatch status was principally from the continued uncertainty around the closing of the China Oceanwide transaction and the associated regulatory review, and the timing of the deal close. 
 On July 25, 2018, A.M. Best affirmed the financial strength ratings of our principal life insurance subsidiaries and the credit rating of Genworth Financial and Genworth Holdings. Likewise, A.M. Best removed the under review with developing implications status on all existing Genworth ratings and assigned a stable outlook. These actions were taken by A.M. Best primarily from the outcome of the CFIUS review and our ability to address our May 2018 senior notes. 
 
28 


 On February 12, 2018, Moodys downgraded the financial strength ratings of GLIC and GLICNY from B2 (Poor) to B3 (Poor) and downgraded the financial strength rating of GLAIC from Ba1 (Questionable) to Ba3 (Questionable). The downgrades of GLIC, GLICNY and GLAIC reflect uncertain financial flexibility at Genworth Holdings. In addition, the downgrades of GLIC and GLICNY also reflect concern around our ability to achieve in-force rate actions on our long-term care insurance policies and risks associated with the long-term care insurance market. The downgrade of GLAIC was predominantly focused on earnings volatility due to adverse mortality, reserve increases and accelerated deferred acquisition costs (DAC) amortization after our annual review of assumptions. Moodys revised our ratings outlook from review for downgrade to negative mostly reflecting execution risk associated with the closing of the China Oceanwide transaction and continued liquidity risk due to our material debt maturities over the next five years. 
 On February 12, 2018, A.M. Best downgraded the financial strength rating of GLAIC from B++ (Good) to B+ (Good) and downgraded the financial strength ratings of GLIC and GLICNY from B (Fair) to B- (Fair). A.M. Best also announced that all ratings will remain under review pending the outcome of the China Oceanwide transaction; however, they revised their ratings outlook from negative implications to developing implications in response to our actions to address upcoming debt maturities. The A.M. Best downgrade of GLIC reflects their views on the lack of balance sheet strength along with marginal operating performance with limited product offerings as a result of our decision to discontinue new sales of traditional life and annuity products in 2016. Additionally, for GLIC and GLICNY, the A.M. Best downgrade also reflects limited growth potential as future growth is mainly based on continued in-force rate actions on our long-term care insurance products, and the dependence on the long-term care insurance market, which A.M. Best views as higher risk. Conversely, A.M. Best believes the balance sheet of GLAIC is adequate but is mostly muted by marginal operating performance and its limited business profile. 
 In addition to the financial strength ratings for our operating subsidiaries, rating agencies also assign credit ratings to the debt issued by our intermediate holding company, Genworth Holdings. These ratings are typically notched lower than the financial strength ratings of our primary operating subsidiaries, reflecting Genworth Holdings reliance on dividends from the operating subsidiaries to service its debt obligations. The unsecured debt ratings may be used in evaluating Genworth Holdings debt as a fixed income investment. On February 12, 2018, S&P rated the proposed Term Loan B+ (Weak) with a negative CreditWatch status, one notch higher than Genworth Holdings unsecured debt rating of B (Weak), negative CreditWatch status, reflecting the collateral pool of GFIHs ownership interest in Genworth Canada. On February 12, 2018, Moodys rated the proposed Term Loan Ba3 (Questionable), two notches higher than Genworth Holdings unsecured debt rating of B2 (Poor), also reflecting the underlying collateral. Moodys outlook is negative on our debt ratings. 
 S&P, Moodys, DBRS, A.M. Best, Fitch and HR Ratings review their ratings on a regular basis and we cannot assure you that we will maintain our current ratings in the future. Other agencies may also rate our company or our insurance subsidiaries on a solicited or an unsolicited basis. We do not provide information to agencies issuing unsolicited ratings and we cannot ensure that any agencies that rate our company or our insurance subsidiaries on an unsolicited basis will continue to do so. 
 For information on adverse credit rating actions related to Genworth Holdings, see Item 1ARisk FactorsAdverse rating agency actions have resulted in a loss of business and adversely affected our results of operations, financial condition and business and future adverse rating actions could have a further and more significant adverse impact on us. 
 Investments 
 Organization 
 Our investment department includes asset management, portfolio management, derivatives, risk management, operations, accounting and other functions. Under the direction of our Chief Investment Officer, it is responsible for managing the assets in our various portfolios, including establishing investment and derivatives 
 
29 


  policies and strategies, reviewing asset-liability management, performing asset allocation for our domestic subsidiaries and coordinating investment activities with our international subsidiaries. 
 We use both internal and external asset managers to take advantage of expertise in particular asset classes or to leverage country-specific investing capabilities. We internally manage certain asset classes for our domestic insurance operations, including public government, municipal and corporate securities, structured securities, commercial mortgage loans, privately placed debt securities, equity securities and derivatives. We utilize external asset managers for most of our international portfolios, as well as select asset classes. Management of investments for our international operations is overseen by the investment committees reporting to the boards of directors of the applicable non-U.S. legal entities in consultation with our Chief Investment Officer. The majority of the assets in our Canadian and Australian mortgage insurance businesses are managed by unaffiliated investment managers located in their respective countries. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, approximately 10% of our invested assets were held by our international businesses and were invested primarily in non-U.S.-denominated securities. 
 We manage our assets to meet diversification, credit quality, yield and liquidity requirements of our policy and contract liabilities by investing primarily in fixed maturity securities, including government, municipal and corporate bonds and mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities. We also hold mortgage loans on commercial real estate and other invested assets, which include derivatives, bank loans, limited partnerships and short-term investments. Investments for our particular insurance company subsidiaries are required to comply with our risk management requirements, as well as applicable laws and insurance regulations. 
 For a discussion of our investments, see Part IIItem 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsConsolidated Balance Sheets. 
 Our primary investment objective is to meet our obligations to policyholders and contractholders while increasing value to our stockholders by investing in a diversified, high quality portfolio, comprised primarily of income producing securities and other assets. Our investment strategy focuses on: 
 

 | managing interest rate risk, as appropriate, through monitoring asset durations relative to policyholder and contractholder obligations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | selecting assets based on fundamental, research-driven strategies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


 | emphasizing fixed-income, low-volatility assets while pursuing active strategies to enhance yield;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet unexpected financial obligations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | regularly evaluating our asset class mix and pursuing additional investment classes when prudent; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | continuously monitoring asset quality and market conditions that could affect our assets.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We are exposed to two primary sources of investment risk: 
 

 | credit risk relating to the uncertainty associated with the continued ability of a given issuer to make timely payments of principal and interest and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | interest rate risk relating to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in market interest rates.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We manage credit risk by analyzing issuers, transaction structures and any associated collateral. We continually evaluate the probability of credit default and estimated loss in the event of such a default, which provides us with early notification of worsening credits. We also manage credit risk through industry and issuer diversification and asset allocation practices. For commercial mortgage loans, we manage credit risk through property type, geographic region and product type diversification and asset allocation. 
 We manage interest rate risk by monitoring the relationship between the duration of our assets and the duration of our liabilities, seeking to manage interest rate risk in both rising and falling interest rate 
 
30 


  environments, and utilizing various derivative strategies, where appropriate and available. For further information on our management of interest rate risk, see Part IIItem 7AQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Fixed maturity securities 
 Fixed maturity securities, which are classified as available-for-sale, including tax-exempt bonds, consisting principally of publicly traded and privately placed debt securities, represent 83% of total cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and invested assets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. 
 We invest in privately placed fixed maturity securities to increase diversification and obtain higher yields than can ordinarily be obtained with comparable public market securities. Generally, private placements provide us with protective covenants, call protection features and, where applicable, a higher level of collateral. However, our private placements are not as freely transferable as public securities because of restrictions imposed by federal and state securities laws, the terms of the securities and the characteristics of the private market. 
 The following table presents our public, private and total fixed maturity securities by the Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSRO) designations and/or equivalent ratings, as well as the percentage, based upon fair value that each designation comprises. Certain fixed maturity securities that are not rated by an NRSRO are shown based upon internally prepared credit evaluations.

 Based upon fair value, public fixed maturity securities represented 70% and 73%, respectively, of total fixed maturity securities as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. Private fixed maturity securities represented 30% and 27%, respectively, of total fixed maturity securities as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. 
 We diversify our corporate securities by industry and issuer. As of December 31, 2018, our combined holdings in the 10 corporate issuers to which we had the greatest exposure was $2.2 billion, which was approximately 3% of our total cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and invested assets. The exposure to the largest single corporate issuer held as of December 31, 2018 was $337 million, which was less than 1% of our total cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and invested assets. See note 4 to our consolidated financial statements under Part IIItem 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information on diversification by sector. 
 We do not have material unhedged exposure to foreign currency risk in our invested assets. In our international insurance operations, both our assets and liabilities are generally denominated in local currencies. For certain invested assets in our international insurance operations that are denominated in currencies other than their respective local currency, we have effectively hedged the exposure to foreign currency risk. 
 Further analysis related to our investments portfolio as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 is included under Part IIItem 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsInvestments and Derivative Instruments. 
 Commercial mortgage loans and other invested assets 
 Our mortgage loans are collateralized by commercial properties, including multi-family residential buildings. Commercial mortgage loans are primarily stated at principal amounts outstanding, net of deferred expenses and allowance for loan losses. We diversify our commercial mortgage loans by both property type and geographic region. See note 4 to our consolidated financial statements under Part IIItem 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information on distribution across property type and geographic region for commercial mortgage loans, as well as information on our interest in equity securities and other invested assets. 
 Selected financial information regarding our other invested assets and derivative instruments as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 is included under Part IIItem 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsInvestments and Derivative Instruments. 
 Regulation 
 Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and supervision. 
 General 
 Our insurance operations are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations. State insurance laws and regulations (Insurance Laws) regulate most aspects of our U.S. insurance businesses, and our U.S. insurers are regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled and licensed. Our non-U.S. insurance operations are principally regulated by insurance regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled. Our insurance products and businesses also are affected by U.S. federal, state and local tax laws, and the tax laws of non-U.S. jurisdictions. Our securities operations, including our insurance products that are regulated as securities, such as variable annuities and variable life insurance, also are subject to U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. securities laws and regulations. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), FINRA, state securities authorities and similar non-U.S. authorities regulate and supervise these products. 
 The primary purpose of the Insurance Laws regulating our insurance businesses and their equivalents in the other countries in which we operate, and the securities laws affecting our variable annuity products, variable life 
 
32 


  insurance products, registered FABNs and our broker/dealer, is to protect our policyholders, contractholders and clients, not our stockholders. These laws and regulations are regularly re-examined and any changes to these laws or new laws may be more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations. 
 Insurance and securities regulatory authorities (including state law enforcement agencies and attorneys general or their non-U.S. equivalents) periodically make inquiries regarding compliance with insurance, securities and other laws and regulations, and we cooperate with such inquiries and take corrective action when warranted. 
 Our distributors and institutional customers also operate in regulated environments. Changes in the regulations that affect their operations may affect our business relationships with them and their decision to distribute or purchase our subsidiaries products. 
 In addition, the Insurance Laws of our U.S. insurers domiciliary jurisdictions and the equivalent laws in Australia, Canada and certain other jurisdictions in which we operate require that a person obtain the approval of the applicable insurance regulator prior to acquiring control, and in some cases prior to divesting its control, of an insurer. These laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent an investment in or a change of control involving us, or one or more of our regulated subsidiaries, including transactions that our management and some or all of our stockholders might consider desirable. 
 U.S. Insurance Regulation 
 Our U.S. insurers are licensed and regulated in all jurisdictions in which they conduct insurance business. The extent of this regulation varies, but Insurance Laws generally govern the financial condition of insurers, including standards of solvency, types and concentrations of permissible investments, establishment and maintenance of reserves, credit for reinsurance and requirements of capital adequacy, and the business conduct of insurers, including marketing and sales practices and claims handling. In addition, Insurance Laws usually require the licensing of insurers and agents, and the approval of policy forms, related materials and the rates for certain lines of insurance. For example, in most states where our U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiaries are licensed, we are required to file rates before we are authorized to charge premiums. In some states, these rates must be approved before their use. Likewise, changes in rates must be filed and receive approval. In general, states may require actuarial justification on the basis of the insurers loss experience, expenses and future projections. In addition, states may consider general default experience in the U.S. mortgage insurance industry in assessing the premium rates charged by U.S. mortgage insurers. 
 The Insurance Laws applicable to us or our U.S. insurers are described below. Our U.S. mortgage insurers are also subject to additional Insurance Laws applicable specifically to mortgage insurers discussed below under Mortgage Insurance Regulation. 
 Insurance holding company regulation 
 All U.S. jurisdictions in which our U.S. insurers conduct business have enacted legislation requiring each U.S. insurer (except captive insurers) in a holding company system to register with the insurance regulatory authority of its domiciliary jurisdiction and furnish that regulatory authority various information concerning the operations of, and the interrelationships and transactions among, companies within its holding company system that may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the system. These Insurance Laws regulate transactions between insurers and their affiliates, sometimes mandating prior notice to the regulator and/or regulatory approval. Generally, these Insurance Laws require that all transactions between an insurer and an affiliate be fair and reasonable, and that the insurers statutory surplus following such transaction be reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs. 
 Our U.S. subsidiary insurers payment of dividends or other distributions to our holding company is regulated by the Insurance Laws of their respective domiciliary states, and insurers may not pay an 
 
33 


  extraordinary dividend or distribution, or pay a dividend except out of earned surplus, without prior regulatory approval. In general, an extraordinary dividend or distribution is defined as a dividend or distribution that, together with other dividends and distributions made within the preceding 12 months, exceeds the greater (or, in some jurisdictions, the lesser) of: 
 

 | 10% of the insurers statutory surplus as of the immediately prior year end or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the statutory net gain from the insurers operations (if a life insurer) or the statutory net income (loss) (if not a life insurer) during the prior calendar year.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, insurance regulators may prohibit the payment of ordinary dividends or other payments by our insurers (such as a payment under a tax sharing agreement or for employment or other services) if they determine that such payment could be adverse to our policyholders or contractholders. 
 The Insurance Laws require that a person obtain the approval of the insurance commissioner of an insurers domiciliary jurisdiction prior to acquiring control of such insurer. Control of an insurer is generally presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing 10% or more of the voting securities of the insurer or any parent company of the insurer. In considering an application to acquire control of an insurer, the insurance commissioner generally considers factors such as the experience, competence and financial strength of the applicant, the integrity of the applicants board of directors and executive officers, the acquirers plans for the management and operation of the insurer, and any anti-competitive results that may arise from the acquisition. Many states require a person seeking to acquire control of an insurer licensed but not domiciled in that state to make a filing prior to completing an acquisition if the acquirer and its affiliates and the target insurer and its affiliates have specified market shares in the same lines of insurance in that state. These provisions may not require acquisition approval but can lead to imposition of conditions on an acquisition that could delay or prevent its consummation. 
 The Insurance Laws require that an insurance holding company systems ultimate controlling person submit annually to its lead state insurance regulator an enterprise risk report that identifies activities, circumstances or events involving one or more affiliates of an insurer that, if not remedied properly, are likely to have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition or liquidity of the insurer or its insurance holding company system as a whole. The Insurance Laws also require that a controlling person of an insurer submit prior notice to the insurers domiciliary insurance regulator of a divestiture of control. Finally, most states have adopted insurance regulations setting forth detailed requirements for cost sharing and management agreements between an insurer and its affiliates. 
 The NAIC adopted the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Model Act (the ORSA Model Act). The ORSA Model Act requires an insurance holding company systems Chief Risk Officer to submit annually to its lead state insurance regulator an Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) Summary Report. The ORSA is a confidential internal assessment appropriate to the nature, scale and complexity of an insurer, conducted by that insurer of the material and relevant risks identified enterprise wide by the insurer associated with an insurers current business plan and the sufficiency of capital and liquidity resources to support those risks. Most states have adopted the ORSA Model Act. Under ORSA, we are required to: 
 

 | regularly, no less than annually, conduct an ORSA to assess the adequacy of our risk management framework, including enhancements and updates to such framework, and current and estimated projected future solvency position;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | internally document the process and results of the assessment; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


 | provide a confidential high-level ORSA Summary Report annually to the lead state commissioner if the insurer is a member of an insurance group and make such report available, upon request, to other domiciliary state regulators within the holding company group.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The NAIC has adopted several model laws and regulations as part of its now completed Solvency Modernization Initiative. For example, the NAIC adopted the Corporate Governance Annual Disclosure Model 
 
34 


  Act and the Corporate Governance Annual Disclosure Model Regulation (the Corporate Governance Model Act and Regulation), that would require insurers to disclose detailed information regarding their governance practices. The Corporate Governance Model Act (as opposed to the corresponding regulation) has been adopted in 26 states, but in only two states where our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled. In addition, the NAIC adopted amendments to the insurance holding company model act and regulations (the NAIC Holding Company Amendments) that would authorize U.S. regulators to, among other items, lead or participate in the group-wide supervision of certain international insurance groups. The NAIC Holding Company Amendments must be adopted by individual state legislatures in order to be effective in a particular state. To date, the amendments to the Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act (as opposed to the corresponding regulation) have been adopted in Delaware, but not in Virginia, North Carolina or New York. 
 During 2014, the NAIC approved a regulatory framework applicable to the use of captive insurers in connection with Regulation XXX and Regulation AXXX transactions. Among other things, the framework calls for more disclosure of an insurers use of captives in its statutory financial statements, and narrows the types of assets permitted to back statutory reserves that are required to support the insurers future obligations. The NAIC implemented the framework through an actuarial guideline (AG 48), which requires the actuary of the ceding insurer that opines on the insurers reserves to issue a qualified opinion if the framework is not followed. The requirements of AG 48 became effective as of January 1, 2015 in all states, without any further action necessary by state legislatures or insurance regulators to implement it, other than to refer to the revised NAIC Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual, which included the new requirements of AG 48. In December 2016, the NAIC adopted a revised version of AG 48 (Updated AG 48), with revisions applicable to new policies issued and new reinsurance transactions entered into on or after January 1, 2017. AG 48 and Updated AG 48 do not affect reinsurance arrangements that were pre-existing as of January 1, 2015, and the changes set forth in Updated AG 48 do not affect reinsurance arrangements that were pre-existing as of January 1, 2017. In December 2016, the NAIC also adopted the Term and Universal Life Insurance Reserve Financing Model Regulation, which subsequent to the adoption date, codified the provisions of AG 48 and Updated AG 48. The states have started to adopt this model regulation. It is not clear what additional changes or state variations may emerge as the states adopt this model regulation. In 2017, Virginia adopted its rules governing Term and Universal Life Insurance Reserve Financing, which was effective for GLAIC on January 1, 2018. Virginia is among four states to adopt the new rules under the Term and Universal Life Insurance Reserve Financing Model Regulation. 
 Periodic reporting 
 Our U.S. insurers must file reports, including detailed annual financial statements, with insurance regulatory authorities in each jurisdiction in which they do business, and their operations and accounts are subject to periodic examination by such authorities. 
 Policy forms 
 Our U.S. insurers policy forms are subject to regulation in every U.S. jurisdiction in which they transact insurance business. In most U.S. jurisdictions, policy forms must be filed prior to their use, and in some U.S. jurisdictions, forms must be approved by insurance regulatory authorities prior to use. 
 Market conduct regulation 
 The Insurance Laws of U.S. jurisdictions govern the marketplace activities of insurers, affecting the form and content of disclosure to consumers, product illustrations, advertising, product replacement, sales and underwriting practices, and complaint and claims handling, and these provisions are generally enforced through periodic market conduct examinations. 
 Statutory examinations 
 Insurance departments in U.S. jurisdictions conduct periodic detailed examinations of the books, records, accounts and business practices of domestic insurers. These examinations generally are conducted in cooperation 
 
35 


  with insurance departments of two or three other states or jurisdictions representing each of the NAIC zones, under guidelines promulgated by the NAIC. 
 Guaranty associations and similar arrangements 
 Most jurisdictions in which our U.S. insurers are licensed require those insurers to participate in guaranty associations which pay contractual benefits owed under the policies of impaired or insolvent insurers. These associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on each member insurer in a jurisdiction on the basis of the proportionate share of the premiums written by such insurer in the lines of business in which the impaired, insolvent or failed insurer is engaged. Some jurisdictions permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets. 
 On March 1, 2017, the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court approved petitions to liquidate Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company and American Network Insurance Company (Penn Treaty) due to financial difficulties that could not be resolved through rehabilitation. As a result, we received guaranty fund assessments of $32 million related to Penn Treaty in 2017, of which our long-term care insurance business recorded the majority of the expense. 
 Aggregate assessments levied against our U.S. insurers were not significant to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2016. 
 Policy and contract reserve sufficiency analysis 
 The Insurance Laws of their domiciliary jurisdictions require our U.S. life insurers to conduct annual analyses of the sufficiency of their life and health insurance and annuity reserves. Other jurisdictions where insurers are licensed may have certain reserve requirements that differ from those of their domiciliary jurisdictions. In each case, a qualified actuary must submit an opinion stating that the aggregate statutory reserves, when considered in light of the assets held with respect to such reserves, make good and sufficient provision for the insurers associated contractual obligations and related expenses. If such an opinion cannot be provided, the insurer must establish additional reserves by transferring funds from surplus. Our U.S. life insurers submit these opinions annually to their insurance regulatory authorities. We annually conduct a statutory cash flow testing process to support our opinions. Different reserve requirements exist for our U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiaries. See Mortgage Insurance RegulationState regulationReserves. 
 Surplus and capital requirements 
 Insurance regulators have the discretionary authority, in connection with maintaining the licensing of our U.S. insurers, to limit or restrict insurers from issuing new policies, or policies having a dollar value over certain thresholds, if, in the regulators judgment, the insurer is not maintaining a sufficient amount of surplus or is in a hazardous financial condition. We seek to maintain new business and capital management strategies to support meeting related regulatory requirements.
 Risk-based capital 
 The NAIC has established RBC standards for U.S. life insurers, as well as a risk-based capital model act (RBC Model Act). All 50 states and the District of Columbia have adopted the RBC Model Act or a substantially similar law or regulation. The RBC Model Act requires that life insurers annually submit a report to state regulators regarding their RBC based upon four categories of risk: asset risk, insurance risk, interest rate and market risk, and business risk. The capital requirement for each is generally determined by applying factors which vary based upon the degree of risk to various asset, premium and reserve items. The formula is an early warning tool to identify possible weakly capitalized companies for purposes of initiating further regulatory action. 
 
36 


 Regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of a companys total adjusted capital (TAC) to its authorized control level RBC (ACL RBC). The minimum level of TAC before corrective action commences (Company Action Level) is two times the ACL RBC or three times the ACL RBC with a negative trend. If an insurers ACL RBC falls below specified levels, it would be subject to different degrees of regulatory action depending upon the level, ranging from requiring the insurer to propose actions to correct the capital deficiency to placing the insurer under regulatory control. Our reported RBC ratio measures the ratio of TAC to our Company Action Level. 
 As of December 31, 2018, the RBC of each of our U.S. life insurance subsidiaries exceeded the level of RBC that would require any of them to take or become subject to any corrective action in their respective domiciliary state. The consolidated RBC ratio of our U.S. domiciled life insurance subsidiaries was approximately 199% and 282% as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
 Group capital 
 The NAIC and international insurance regulators, including the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS), are continuing to develop group capital standards. The NAIC is developing a group capital calculation tool using an RBC aggregation methodology for all entities within the insurance holding company system. The NAIC expects to enter the field testing phase in early 2019. The IAIS has been developing a risk-based global insurance capital standard (ICS) based upon 10 key principles, which might impact internationally active insurance groups and current global systemically important insurers, as defined by the IAIS. The IAIS expects to adopt the ICS in November 2019, to be followed by a five-year monitoring period prior to implementation. It is unclear how the development of group capital measures by the NAIC and IAIS will interact with existing capital requirements for insurance companies in the United States and with international capital standards. It is possible that we may be required to hold additional capital as a result of these developments. 
 Statutory accounting principles 
 U.S. insurance regulators developed statutory accounting principles (SAP) as a basis of accounting used to monitor and regulate the solvency of insurers. Since insurance regulators are primarily concerned with ensuring an insurers ability to pay its current and future obligations to policyholders, statutory accounting conservatively values the assets and liabilities of insurers, generally in accordance with standards specified by the insurers domiciliary jurisdiction. Uniform statutory accounting practices are established by the NAIC and are generally adopted by regulators in the various U.S. jurisdictions. 
 Due to differences in methodology between SAP and U.S. GAAP, the values for assets, liabilities and equity reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP are materially different from those reflected in financial statements prepared under SAP. 
 Regulation of investments 
 Each of our U.S. insurers is subject to Insurance Laws that require diversification of its investment portfolio and which limit the proportion of investments in different asset categories. Assets invested contrary to such regulatory limitations must be treated as non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring surplus, and, in some instances, regulations require divestiture of such non-complying investments. We believe the investments made by our U.S. insurers comply with these Insurance Laws. 
 The NAIC continues to review the investment risk factors for fixed income assets that are applied in the NAICs RBC formula for life insurers. In August 2017, the NAICs Investment Risk-Based Capital Working Group exposed new factors for comment with the expectation that the proposed factors would be effective for the year ending 2019. The proposed factors are applied to 20 different ratings categories versus the current six 
 
37 


  ratings categories, thereby providing additional granularity to the risk charges applied across insurer investment portfolios. Generally, the proposed factors are higher than the current factors for more highly rated fixed income assets and are lower than current factors for lower rated fixed income assets. The NAIC is still targeting year-end 2019 for the implementation date, although it is more likely that the revisions will become effective by year-end 2020. Additional time is needed for the NAIC to update its systems so that it can accept the 20 new ratings categories. If the proposed factors are adopted, we believe our required capital will increase. In addition, the proposed factors may encourage insurers to invest more of their portfolios in lower rated fixed income assets to benefit from the lower risk charges. 
 Federal regulation of insurance products 
 Most of our variable annuity products, some of our fixed guaranteed products, and all of our variable life insurance products, as well as our FABNs issued as part of our registered notes program are securities within the meaning of federal and state securities laws, are registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and are subject to regulation by the SEC. See Other Laws and RegulationsSecurities regulation. The entities that offer these products that are broker/dealers, as defined by the SEC, are also regulated by FINRA and may be regulated by state securities authorities. Federal and state securities regulation similar to that discussed below under Other Laws and RegulationsSecurities regulation affects investment advice and sales and related activities with respect to these products. U.S. mortgage insurance products and insurers are also subject to federal regulation discussed below under Mortgage Insurance Regulation. In addition, although the federal government does not comprehensively regulate the business of insurance, federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas, including taxation, financial services regulation, and pension and welfare benefits regulation, can also significantly affect the insurance industry. 
 Dodd-Frank Act and other federal initiatives 
 Although the federal government generally does not directly regulate the insurance business, federal initiatives often have an impact on the business in a variety of ways, including limitations on antitrust immunity, tax incentives for lifetime annuity payouts, simplification bills affecting tax-advantaged or tax-exempt savings and retirement vehicles, and proposals to modify the estate tax. In addition, various forms of direct federal regulation of insurance have been proposed in recent years. 
 The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) made extensive changes to the laws regulating financial services firms and required various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations, many of which have taken effect. 
 Among other provisions, the Dodd-Frank Act established a new framework of regulation of the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets. The clearing requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act require us to post with a futures commission merchant highly liquid securities or cash as initial margin and cash to meet variation margin requirements for most interest rate derivatives we trade. As the new marketplace continues to evolve, we may have to alter or limit the way we use derivatives in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to similar trade reporting, documentation, central trading and clearing and OTC margining requirements when we transact with foreign derivatives counterparties. In addition, regulations adopted by federal banking regulators that will begin to take effect in 2019 will require certain bank-regulated counterparties and certain of their affiliates to include in certain financial contracts, including many derivatives contracts, terms that delay or restrict the rights of counterparties, such as us, to terminate such contracts, foreclose upon collateral, exercise other default rights or restrict transfers of affiliate credit enhancements (such as guarantees) in the event that the bank-regulated counterparty and/or its affiliates are subject to certain types of resolution or insolvency proceedings. It is possible that these new requirements, as well as potential additional government regulation and other developments in the market, could adversely affect our ability to terminate existing derivatives agreements or to realize amounts to be received 
 
38 


  under such agreements. The Dodd-Frank Act and related federal regulations and foreign derivatives requirements expose us to operational, compliance, execution and other risks, including central counterparty insolvency risk. 
 In the case of our U.S. mortgage insurance business, the Dodd-Frank Act prohibited a creditor from making a residential mortgage loan unless the creditor makes a reasonable and good faith determination that, at the time the loan is consummated, the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay the loan. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB, which regulates certain aspects of the offering and provision of consumer financial products or services but not the business of insurance. Certain rules established by the CFPB require mortgage lenders to demonstrate that they have effectively considered the consumers ability to repay a mortgage loan, establish when a mortgage may be classified as a Qualified Mortgage and determine when a lender is eligible for a safe harbor as a presumption that the lender has complied with the ability-to-repay requirements. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act also established a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), which is authorized to subject non-bank financial companies, which may include insurance companies, deemed systemically significant to stricter prudential standards and other requirements and to subject such companies to a special orderly liquidation process outside the federal Bankruptcy Code, administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. We have not been, nor do we believe we will be, designated as systemically significant by FSOC. FSOCs potential recommendation of measures to address systemic financial risk could affect our insurance operations. A future determination that we or our counterparties are systemically significant could impose significant burdens on us, impact the way we conduct our business, increase compliance costs, duplicate state regulation and result in a competitive disadvantage. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act established a Federal Insurance Office (FIO) within the Department of the Treasury. While not having a general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance, the director of this office performs various functions with respect to insurance, including serving as a non-voting member of the FSOC and making recommendations to the FSOC regarding insurers to be designated for more stringent regulation. 
 In December 2018, the SEC adopted a final rule related to certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The new rule requires companies to describe practices and policies pertaining to transactions that hedge, or are designed to hedge, the market value of equity securities granted as compensation to any employee, including officers or directors. The new rule and related disclosures are required in a proxy statement or information statement related to an election of directors and such disclosures should be by category of employee. Likewise, if a company does not have any such practices or policies, disclosure of that fact must be included in such filings. This final rule is effective in proxy statements or information statements during fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019. 
 On May 24, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (Reform Act) was signed into law. Instead of repealing the Dodd-Frank Act, the Reform Act focused largely on providing relief for smaller banking institutions with total assets below $10 billion and re-defining asset thresholds for a systemically important financial institution. The Reform Act also directs the Director of FIO and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve to support increased transparency at global insurance or international standard-setting regulatory or supervisory forums, and to achieve consensus positions with the states through the NAIC prior to taking a position on any insurance proposal by a global insurance regulatory or supervisory forum. We cannot predict the requirements of all of the regulations adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act or the Reform Act, the effect such legislation or regulations will have on financial markets generally, or on our businesses specifically, the additional costs associated with compliance with such regulations or legislation, or any changes to our operations that may be necessary to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations thereunder, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. We also cannot predict whether other federal initiatives will be adopted or what impact, if any, such initiatives, if adopted as laws, may have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

 Changes in tax laws 
 On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) was signed into law. The enactment of the new law signified the first major overhaul of the U.S. federal income tax system in more than 30 years. In addition to the laws corporate income tax rate reduction, several other provisions are pertinent to our financial statements and related disclosures, and will have an impact on our deferred taxes in future years. The TCJA has also had an immediate impact to our capital through a reduction in the statutory admitted deferred tax asset and an impact to certain cash flow scenario testing included in the RBC calculation. Following the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate, the NAIC revised the factors used for calculating the RBC of insurance companies, which was effective in 2018. The revised factors negatively impacted the RBC ratio of our life insurance subsidiaries by approximately 10 points. 
 In addition to the changes discussed above pertaining to capital and RBC ratios, the following provisions have the most significant impact: 
 

 | Corporate tax rate;
--+--------------------


 | International tax provisions;
--+------------------------------


 | Policyholder reserves;
--+-----------------------


 | Capitalization of certain policy acquisition expenses;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


 | Dividends received deduction and life insurance company share; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Net operating losses and operations loss deductions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------

 During 2018, we finalized the accounting for provisions of the TCJA and related guidance, namely through Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118. This guidance was issued by the SEC to provide relief to companies due to the complexities involved in accounting for the TCJA. See note 13 in our consolidated financial statements under Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information. In addition, during 2018 several clarifying and tax guidance related items were issued from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury on certain aspects of the TCJA. Although we have finalized the accounting for the TCJA and SAB 118, we are in the process of evaluating these new tax related items and the impact it will have on our results of operations and financial condition. See Item 1ARisk FactorsChanges in tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, results of operations or financial condition. 
 Corporate Tax Rate 
 Prior to the recent TCJA, the top U.S. corporate federal income tax rate was 35% for corporations with taxable income greater than $10 million. The TCJA reduced the U.S. corporate federal income tax rate to 21% effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. Included in our 2017 benefit for income taxes is $154 million of tax benefits associated with revaluing our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the new rate on the date of enactment. 
International Tax Provisions 
 Prior to the TCJA, a U.S. shareholder was generally not required to include in income the earnings and profits (E&P) of a controlled foreign corporation (CFC), other than income taxed under Subpart F, until distributed, or repatriated, to the U.S. shareholder. To the extent the U.S. shareholder determined its pool of accumulated E&P were positive, any subsequent distributions were taxable to the U.S. shareholder as a dividend when paid. 
 The TCJA established a participation exemption system for the taxation of foreign income which generally allows for a 100% deduction for dividends received from CFCs, however, income from CFCs still may be included on a U.S. shareholders return through Subpart F or Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) 
 
40 


  provisions. As a transition to the new participation exemption system, for the last taxable year of a foreign corporation beginning before January 1, 2018, all U.S. shareholders of any CFC or other foreign corporation that is at least 10% U.S.-owned but not controlled must include in income its pro rata share of the accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income that was not previously taxed. A portion of that pro rata share of deferred foreign income is deductible depending on whether the deferred foreign income is held in the form of liquid or illiquid assets. The net of the income inclusion and deduction effectively results in a tax of 15.5% and 8% on deferred foreign income held in liquid and illiquid assets, respectively (herein referred to as the transition tax). Foreign taxes paid or deemed to have been paid are creditable against the additional liability in the same proportion as the net U.S. income inclusion bears to undistributed E&P of the foreign corporation. Any net increase to the tax liability may be paid over an eight-year period. We included in our 2017 U.S. federal income tax return the effects of this provision, however, it resulted in no current tax liability and no amounts are due to be paid over the eight-year period. Included in our 2017 results is $63 million of tax expense related to the transition tax, offset by $127 million of income tax benefit from the write-off of our shareholder tax liability, which represented the tax liability on book over tax basis differences that would have been owed under old tax law. Together, these items represent a net $64 million tax benefit associated with changes in the international provisions. In 2018, we recorded a tax benefit of $10 million as we refined our calculations of post-1986 foreign E&P, related tax pools and the amounts held in cash and other specified assets. The TCJA provides for an election not to apply net operating losses (NOL) deductions against the deferred foreign income recognized as a result of the deemed repatriation. 
 The TCJA also includes a provision by which a taxpayer can make an election to increase the percentage (but not greater than 100%) of domestic taxable income offset by any pre-2018 unused overall domestic loss (ODL) and recharacterized as foreign source income. The provision applies to any ODL generated in a qualified taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018 which has not already been recharacterized. The change in the ODL limitation was a contributing factor to the $258 million release of our valuation allowance during 2017. 
 Policyholder Reserves 
 Prior to the TCJA, life insurance reserves for any contract were the greater of the net surrender value of the contract or the reserves determined under federally prescribed rules, not to exceed the statutory reserve with respect to the contract. The TCJA provides that for purposes of determining the deduction for increases in certain reserves of a life insurance company, the amount of the life insurance reserves for any contract (other than certain variable contracts) is the greater of either the net surrender value of the contract (if any) or 92.81% of the amount determined using the tax reserve method otherwise applicable to the contract as of the date the reserve is determined. In the case of a variable contract, the amount of life insurance reserves for the contract is; (1) the sum of the greater of either the net surrender value of the contract or the separate-account reserve amount for the contract, plus (2) 92.81% of the excess (if any) of the amount determined using the tax reserve method otherwise applicable to the contract as of the date the reserve is determined over the amount determined in item (1). Tax reserves cannot exceed the amount which would be taken into account in determining statutory reserves. Asset adequacy or deficiency reserves are not deductible for tax purposes, consistent with prescribed treatment prior to the TCJA. 
 The provision applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. For the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, the difference in the amount of the reserve with respect to any contract at the end of the preceding taxable year and the amount of such reserve determined as if the TCJA were applied for that year is taken into account ratably over eight taxable years.
 Prior to the TCJA, changes in the basis for determining life insurance company reserves were taken into account ratably over 10 years. Under the TCJA, the income or loss resulting from a change in method of computing life insurance company reserves will be taken into account consistent with IRS procedures, which provide that negative adjustments are deducted from income in the year of the change whereas positive 
 
41 


  adjustments are required to be included in income ratably over four taxable years. Per recent IRS guidance, the taxpayer may only effect such a change upon proper filing of an application for a change in tax accounting method. The provision applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. As these changes relate to temporary differences, there will be no impact on our provision (benefit) for income taxes in the future. 
 Capitalization of Certain Policy Acquisition Expenses 
 Under the TCJA, specified policy acquisition expenses as modified in the bill are computed as the sum of 2.09% of the net premiums on annuity contracts, 2.45% of net premiums on group life insurance policies and 9.20% of net premiums on other life insurance policies not specified as annuity contracts or group life policies. These capitalization rates were 1.75%, 2.05% and 7.70%, respectively, prior to the TCJA. The amortization period was modified from a 120-month to a 180-month period beginning with the first month in the second half of the taxable year. The provision applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 with no change to the amortization period of capitalized expenses as of December 31, 2017. As these changes relate to temporary differences, there will be no impact on our provision (benefit) for income taxes in the future. 
Dividends Received Deduction and Life Insurance Company Share 
 Corporations are allowed a deduction with respect to dividends received from other taxable domestic corporations, referred to as the dividends received deduction (DRD). Prior to the TCJA, the amount of the deduction was generally equal to 70% of the dividends received. In the case of any dividends received from a 20% owned corporation, the amount of the deduction was equal to 80% of the dividend received. As a result of the corporate income tax rate reduction from a top rate of 35% to 21%, the bill reduced the 70% DRD to 50% and the 80% DRD to 65%. The treatment of dividends received from a corporation that is a member of the same affiliated group was unchanged. 
 Life insurance companies are subject to proration rules for certain deductions which could be viewed as funded proportionately out of taxable and tax-exempt income. Similarly, under the proration rules, a life insurance company is allowed a DRD from nonaffiliates in proportion to the companys share of such dividends, thus excluding the policyholders share from the amount of dividends eligible for the DRD. Prior to the TCJA, the determination of the companys share and policyholders share was a complex computation obtained by analyzing the companys share of net investment income in proportion to the total net investment income for the taxable year. Under the TCJA, the special rules for determining the companys share for purposes of the DRD were replaced with a universal 70% rate for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. This provision did not have an impact on the 2017 financial statements and had an immaterial impact on 2018 results. 
 Net Operating Losses and Operations Loss Deductions 
 Prior to the TCJA, NOLs could generally be carried back two years and forward 20 years to offset taxable income in such years. For life insurance companies, there was a special rule which provided that operations loss deductions (OLDs) could be carried back three years and forward 15 years to offset life insurance company taxable income. NOLs and OLDs could be utilized to reduce regular taxable income and life insurance company taxable income, respectively, to zero. 
 Under the TCJA, the special rule for life insurance company OLDs was repealed, thus conforming life insurance companies to other non-insurance corporations with regard to the treatment of NOLs. The bill further modified the NOL rules by limiting the NOL deduction to 80% of taxable income (determined without regard to the deduction), for losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. The provision repealed the two-year carryback but provided for indefinite carryovers for losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. This provision has no impact on our existing U.S. NOLs of $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2018. Future NOLs would be limited to 80% utilization in the year of loss, or can be carried forward indefinitely, as there is no expiration period. Property and casualty insurance companies are still subject to the old carryback/carryforward rules.

 Mortgage Insurance Regulation 
 State regulation 
 General 
 Mortgage insurers generally are limited by Insurance Laws to directly writing only mortgage insurance business to the exclusion of other types of insurance. Mortgage insurers are not subject to the NAICs RBC requirements but certain states and other regulators impose another form of capital requirement on mortgage insurers, requiring maintenance of a risk-to-capital ratio not to exceed 25:1. GMICO, our primary U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiary, had a risk-to-capital ratio of 12.5:1 and 12.9:1 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
 The North Carolina Department of Insurances (NCDOI) current regulatory framework by which GMICOs risk-to-capital ratio is calculated differs from the capital requirements of the GSEs as discussed under Other U.S. regulation. 
 The NAIC established a Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Working Group (the MGIWG) to determine and make recommendations to the NAICs Financial Condition Committee as to what, if any, changes to make to the solvency and other regulations relating to mortgage guaranty insurers. The MGIWG continues to work on revisions to the NAICs Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Model Act (the MGI Model). The proposed amendments of the MGI Model relate to, among other things: (i) capital and reserve standards, including increased minimum capital and surplus requirements, mortgage guaranty-specific RBC standards, dividend restrictions and contingency and premium deficiency reserves; (ii) limitations on the geographic concentration of mortgage guaranty risk, including state-based limitations; (iii) restrictions on mortgage insurers investments in notes secured by mortgages; (iv) prudent underwriting standards and formal underwriting guidelines to be approved by the insurers board; (v) the establishment of formal, internal Mortgage Guaranty Quality Control Programs with respect to in-force business; (vi) prohibitions on captive reinsurance arrangements; and (vii) incorporation of an NAIC Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Standards Manual. The MGIWG is currently working on the development of the mortgage guaranty insurance capital model, which is needed to determine the RBC and loan-level capital standards for the amended MGI Model. At this time, we cannot predict the outcome of this process, the effect changes, if any, will have on the mortgage guaranty insurance market generally, or on our businesses specifically, the additional costs associated with compliance with any such changes, or any changes to our operations that may be necessary to comply, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. We also cannot predict whether other regulatory initiatives will be adopted or what impact, if any, such initiatives, if adopted as laws, may have on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Reserves 
 Insurance Laws require our U.S. mortgage insurers to establish a special statutory contingency reserve in their statutory financial statements to provide for losses in the event of significant economic declines. Annual additions to the statutory contingency reserve must be at least 50% of net earned premiums as defined by Insurance Laws. These contingency reserves generally are held until the earlier of (i) the time that loss ratios exceed 35% or (ii) 10 years, although regulators have granted discretionary releases from time to time. However, approval by the NCDOI, our primary domiciliary regulator, is required for contingency reserve releases when loss ratios exceed 35%. This reserve reduces the policyholder surplus of our U.S. mortgage insurers, and therefore, their ability to pay dividends to us. The statutory contingency reserve for our U.S. mortgage insurers was approximately $1,591 million as of December 31, 2018. 
 Federal regulation 
 In addition to federal laws directly applicable to mortgage insurers, the laws and regulations applicable to mortgage originators and lenders, purchasers of mortgage loans such as Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, and governmental insurers such as the FHA and VA indirectly affect mortgage insurers. For example, changes in 
 
43 


  federal housing legislation and other laws and regulations that affect the demand for private mortgage insurance, or the way in which such laws and regulations are interpreted or applied, may have a material effect on private mortgage insurers. Legislation or regulation that increases the number of people eligible for FHA or VA mortgages could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to compete with the FHA or VA. 
 The Homeowners Protection Act of 1998 (the Homeowners Protection Act) provides for the automatic termination, or cancellation upon a borrowers request, of the borrowers obligation to pay for private mortgage insurance upon satisfaction of certain conditions, although mortgage servicers may continue to keep the coverage in place at their expense. The Homeowners Protection Act applies to owner-occupied residential mortgage loans regardless of lien priority and to borrower-paid mortgage insurance closed after July 29, 1999. FHA loans are not covered by the Homeowners Protection Act. Under the Homeowners Protection Act, automatic termination of the borrowers obligation to pay for mortgage insurance would generally occur once the loan-to-value ratio reaches 78%. A borrower generally may request cancellation of mortgage insurance once the actual payments reduce the loan balance to 80% of the homes original value. For borrower-initiated cancellation of mortgage insurance, the borrower must have a good payment history as defined by the Homeowners Protection Act. 
 The Real Estate Settlement and Procedures Act of 1974 (RESPA) applies to most residential mortgages insured by private mortgage insurers. Mortgage insurance has been considered in some cases to be a settlement service for purposes of loans subject to RESPA. Subject to limited exceptions, RESPA precludes us from providing services to mortgage lenders free of charge, charging fees for services that are lower than their reasonable or fair market value, and paying fees for services that others provide that are higher than their reasonable or fair market value. In addition, RESPA prohibits persons from giving or accepting any portion or percentage of a charge for a real estate settlement service, other than for services actually performed. Although many states prohibit mortgage insurers from giving rebates, RESPA has been interpreted to cover many non-fee services as well. Mortgage insurers and their customers are subject to the possible sanctions of this law, which may be enforced by the CFPB, state insurance departments, state attorneys general and other enforcement authorities. 
 The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) and the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) also affect the business of mortgage insurance in various ways. ECOA, for example, prohibits discrimination against certain protected classes in credit transactions. FCRA governs the access and use of consumer credit information in credit transactions and requires notices to consumers in certain circumstances. 
 Other U.S. regulation 
 Effective December 31, 2015, each GSE adopted revised PMIERs, which set forth operational and financial requirements that mortgage insurers must meet in order to remain eligible. Each approved mortgage insurer is required to provide the GSEs with an annual certification and a quarterly report as to its compliance with PMIERs. The financial requirements of PMIERs mandate that a mortgage insurers Available Assets (generally only the most liquid assets of an insurer) must meet or exceed Minimum Required Assets (which are based on an insurers risk in-force and are calculated from tables of factors with several risk dimensions and are subject to a floor amount). The operational PMIERs requirements include standards that govern the relationship between the GSEs and approved insurers and are designed to ensure that approved insurers operate under uniform guidelines, such as claim processing timelines. They include quality control requirements that are designed to ensure that approved insurers have a strong internal risk management infrastructure that emphasizes continuous process improvement and senior management oversight. The GSEs subsequently issued revisions to PMIERs, referred to as PMIERs 2.0, on September 27, 2018 with an effective date of March 31, 2019. 
 As of December 31, 2018, we estimate our U.S. mortgage insurance business had available assets of approximately 129% of the required assets under the current PMIERs compared to approximately 121% as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the current PMIERs sufficiency ratios were in excess of $750 million and $550 million, respectively, of available assets above the PMIERs requirements. The increase 
 
44 


  during 2018 was driven, in part, by positive operating cash flows and the reduction in delinquent loans. If PMIERs 2.0 had been effective as of December 31, 2018, we estimate that GMICOs sufficiency ratio would have been approximately 120%, or more than $550 million of available assets above the PMIERs 2.0 requirements. This difference is primarily due to the elimination of any credit for future premiums in PMIERs 2.0 that had previously been allowed on insurance policies written in 2008 or earlier. 
 In their respective letters approving credit for reinsurance against PMIERs financial requirements, the GSEs require our U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiary to maintain a maximum statutory risk to capital ratio of 18:1 or they reserve the right to reevaluate the amount of PMIERs credit indicated in their approval letters. Freddie Mac has also imposed additional requirements on our option to commute these reinsurance agreements. Both GSEs reserved the right to periodically review the reinsurance transactions for treatment under PMIERs. 
 Canada regulation 
 The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) provides oversight to all federally incorporated financial institutions, including our Canadian mortgage insurance companies, which are indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of Genworth Canada. OSFI also has oversight responsibility for CMHC, our main competitor. OSFI does not have enforcement powers over market conduct issues in the insurance industry, which are a provincial responsibility. The Bank Act, Insurance Companies Act and Trust and Loan Companies Act prohibit Canadian banks, trust companies and insurers from extending mortgage loans where the loan value exceeds 80% of the propertys value, unless mortgage insurance is obtained in connection with the loan. As a result, all mortgages issued by these financial institutions with a loan-to-value ratio exceeding 80% must be insured by a qualified insurer, which includes CMHC. Legislation prohibits such financial institutions from charging borrowers amounts for mortgage insurance that exceed the lenders actual costs and impose disclosure obligations in respect of mortgage insurance. 
 As discussed in BusinessCanada Mortgage InsuranceGovernment guarantee eligibility, government guaranteed mortgage insurers, including our Canadian mortgage insurance companies, are subject to PRMHIA regulation, which restricts our direct insurance activities to insuring mortgages that meet the governments mortgage insurance eligibility. Reinsurance business is not subject to these restrictions. We are required to hold certain regulatory capital under PRMHIA and the Insurance Companies Act (Canada) to support our outstanding mortgage insurance in-force.
Under PRMHIA, the regulations establish the following criteria that a mortgage must meet in order to be insured: 
 

 | a maximum mortgage amortization of 25 years;
--+---------------------------------------------


 | insurance of mortgages limited to loans with a loan-to-value of 95% or less;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | minimum down payment of 10% required for house prices above CAD$500,000;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | insurance of purchase mortgages only;
--+--------------------------------------


 | insurance of mortgages for investment properties limited to 80% or less;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | capping the maximum gross debt service ratios at 39% and total debt service ratios at 44%;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | capping home purchase price to less than CAD$1 million; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------


 | setting a minimum credit score of 600.
--+---------------------------------------

 As part of our regulatory requirements, we developed and implemented our own risk and solvency assessment (Canada ORSA). Our Canada ORSA is a process that links our risk management framework to our business strategy and decision-making framework. Our Canada ORSA provides a baseline assessment of identified risks and the supporting risk management activities. Additionally, our Canada ORSA documents our 
 
45 


  risk exposure relative to our risk appetite and calculates the capital required to support those risks under certain pre-defined stress events. The implementation of our Canada ORSA did not result in a significant change to our practices of evaluating and managing risks. 
 Effective July 1, 2016, bulk mortgage insurance is only available on mortgages used in the CMHC securitization programs and is prohibited on mortgages used in private securitizations after a phase-in period. In addition, effective November 30, 2016, additional regulatory changes were implemented that prohibit insuring bulk refinances and most investor mortgages originated by lenders on or after October 17, 2016. While there was a one-time increase in bulk insurance volumes in the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to the closing of several large bulk insurance transactions on applications received in the fourth quarter of 2016, bulk insurance volumes have decreased, principally attributable to lower demand due in part to these regulatory changes. 
 Certain jurisdictions in Canada have introduced measures focused on housing markets. On July 25, 2016, in an effort to improve housing affordability, the British Columbia government introduced a plan that included an additional land transfer tax on foreign buyers of property in Metro Vancouver. In addition, on February 20, 2018, the British Columbia government released a plan to further address housing affordability in the province. Among other measures, the plan included an increase and expansion of the existing foreign buyers tax and the introduction of a speculation tax applicable to both foreign and domestic buyers. On April 20, 2017, the Ontario Government released its Fair Housing Plan designed to temper the real estate market. The plan included a non-resident speculation tax that targets affordability in the purchase and rental housing markets in the Greater Toronto Area and surrounding areas. Following these housing policy changes, home sales have decreased in British Columbia and Ontario. 
 On October 3, 2016, the Minister of Finance announced changes intended to reinforce the Canadian housing finance system. These changes primarily included more restrictive qualification guidelines on homebuyers seeking mortgage insurance and new requirements on insured mortgage loans using bulk or other discretionary low loan-to-value mortgage insurance that previously only applied to high loan-to-value insured mortgages. Effective October 17, 2016, all insured homebuyers must qualify for mortgage insurance at an interest rate that is the greater of their contract mortgage rate or the Bank of Canadas conventional five-year fixed posted rate. To qualify for mortgage insurance, borrower debt-servicing ratios cannot exceed the maximum allowable levels of 39% and 44% for gross debt service ratio and total debt service ratio, respectively. Effective November 30, 2016, for insured mortgages with a loan-to-value ratio less than or equal to 80%, new requirements were introduced that previously only applied to high loan-to-value insured mortgages. These changes in regulatory requirements have resulted in a smaller flow mortgage insurance market and lower demand for bulk insurance. 
 Under PRMHIA and the Insurance Companies Act (Canada), our mortgage insurance business in Canada is required to meet a minimum capital test (MCT) to support its outstanding mortgage insurance in-force per the guideline titled Minimum Capital Test for Federally Regulated Property and Casualty Insurance Companies (MCT Guideline). The MCT ratio is calculated based on a methodology prescribed by OSFI. 
 On January 1, 2017, the capital advisory titled Capital Requirements for Federally Regulated Mortgage Insurers became effective. The advisory provides a standard framework for determining the capital requirements for residential mortgage insurance companies. Under this regulatory capital framework, the OSFI Supervisory MCT target and PRMHIA requirement are both 150%. As of December 31, 2018, our MCT ratio under the framework was approximately 172%, which was above the supervisory target. The framework is more risk sensitive than the prior framework and incorporates additional risk attributes, including credit score, remaining amortization and outstanding loan balance. The advisory includes supplementary capital requirements on new business in areas where home prices are high relative to borrower incomes upon origination. 
 On August 9, 2018, OSFI released the guideline Mortgage Insurer Capital Adequacy Test (MICAT), which was effective January 1, 2019 and replaces the current advisory and MCT Guideline. The OSFI supervisory MICAT target ratio and the minimum MICAT ratio under PRMHIA remain at 150% for 2019. The MICAT primarily consolidates existing guidance and is not expected to have a material impact on regulatory 
 
46 


  capital. The primary changes include a 5% increase of the total asset requirement relative to the current calculation, elimination of the requirement to use updated 2016 credit scores for 2015 and prior books in the calculation of the total asset requirement and a transitional arrangement that provides a phase-in period for the increased capital required for insurance risk on outstanding insured mortgages at December 31, 2018. We expect that in 2019, the impact of the elimination of the 2016 credit score update should more than offset the 5% increase in the total asset requirement on existing insurance in-force. We were fully compliant with MICAT on the effective date of January 1, 2019. 
 On October 17, 2017, OSFI released the final version of Guideline B-20 Residential Mortgage Underwriting Practices and Procedures (the B-20 Guideline), which applies to all federally-regulated financial institutions that are engaged in residential mortgage underwriting and/or the acquisition of residential mortgage loan assets in Canada. The guideline was effective January 1, 2018, and requires enhanced underwriting practices for all uninsured mortgages, including the application of a qualifying mortgage rate stress test. The B-20 Guideline does not directly impact the regulatory requirements for our mortgage insurance business in Canada, as it is governed by OSFIs Guideline B-21 Residential Mortgage Insurance Underwriting Practices and Procedures. Based on housing resale activity and mortgage origination volume in 2018, we believe the B-20 Guideline reduced the total 2018 mortgage originations in Canada by approximately 10% to 15% as compared to 2017 levels, including a decline of approximately 5% in the high loan-to-value market size in Canada in 2018 even though qualifying insured mortgages have been subject to a similar mortgage rate stress test since October 17, 2016. 
 The Insurance Companies Act (Canada) provides that dividends may only be declared by the board of directors of the Canadian insurer and paid if there are reasonable grounds to believe that the payment of the dividend would not cause the insurer to be in violation of its minimum capital and liquidity requirements. Also, we are required to notify OSFI prior to the dividend payment. 
 As a public company that is traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange (the TSX), Genworth Canada is subject to securities laws and regulation in each province in Canada, as well as the reporting requirements of the TSX. 
 Australia regulation 
 APRA regulates all ADIs, life insurance, general and mortgage insurance companies in Australia. APRAs authorization conditions require Australian mortgage insurers to be monoline insurers, which are insurers offering just one type of insurance product. APRAs prudential standards apply to individual authorized insurers and to the relevant Australian-based holding company and group. 
 APRA also sets minimum capital levels and monitors corporate governance requirements, including the risk management strategy for our Australian mortgage insurance business. In this regard, APRA reviews our management, controls, processes, reporting and methods by which all risks are managed, including an annual financial condition report and an annual report on insurance liabilities by an appointed actuary. APRA also requires us to submit our risk and reinsurance management strategy, which outlines the use of reinsurance in Australia, annually and more frequently if there are material changes. 
 In setting minimum capital levels, APRA requires mortgage insurers to ensure they have sufficient capital to withstand a hypothetical three-year stress loss scenario defined by APRA. APRAs prudential standards provide for increased mortgage insurers capital requirements for insured loans that are considered to be non-standard. Non-standard mortgages are generally those loans where the lender has not formally verified the borrowers income and employment or where the borrower has not passed standard credit checks. Non-standard mortgages accounted for approximately 1% of our insurance in-force as of December 31, 2018 in our mortgage insurance business in Australia. APRA also imposes quarterly reporting obligations on mortgage insurers with respect to risk profiles, reinsurance arrangements and financial position. We evaluate the capital position of our mortgage insurance business in Australia in relation to the Prescribed Capital Amount (PCA) as determined by APRA, utilizing the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) as the framework to ensure that our 
 
47 


  Australia group of companies as a whole, and each regulated entity, are independently capitalized to meet regulatory requirements. As of December 31, 2018, our PCA ratio was 194%, which is above APRAs capital holding requirements. 
 In addition, APRA determines the capital requirements for ADIs and has reduced capital requirements for certain ADIs that insure residential mortgages with an acceptable mortgage insurer for all non-standard mortgages and for standard mortgages with a loan-to-value ratio above 80%. APRAs prudential standards currently set out a number of circumstances in which a loan may be considered to be non-standard from an ADIs perspective. The capital levels for Australian IRB ADIs are determined by their APRA-approved IRB models, which may or may not allocate capital credit for LMI. We believe that APRA and the IRB ADIs have not yet finalized internal models for residential mortgage risk, so we do not believe that the IRB ADIs currently benefit from an explicit reduction in their capital requirements for mortgages covered by mortgage insurance. APRAs prudential standards also provide that LMI on a non-performing loan (90 days plus arrears) protects most ADIs from having to increase the regulatory capital on the loan to a risk-weighting of 100%. These prudential standards include a definition of an acceptable mortgage insurer and eliminate the reduced capital requirements for ADIs in the event that the mortgage insurer has contractual recourse to the ADI or a member of the ADIs consolidated group. 
 In December 2017, the Basel Committee released its revised framework. Given the broad reach and complexity of the latest Basel reforms, APRA has stated it will give due consideration to appropriate adjustments to the implementation of these reforms to reflect Australian conditions. APRA has stated that it expects to finalize proposed changes to its suite of prudential standards in 2019. 
 In March 2017, APRA announced changes to reinforce sound mortgage lending practices, focusing on slowing investor growth and limiting the flow of new interest-only lending. These changes resulted in a decline in new insurance written volumes in 2017 and 2018. In December 2018, APRA announced its intention to remove the investor loan growth and interest-only lending benchmarks effective January 1, 2019, subject to certain assurances from ADIs as to the strength of their lending standards. 
 APRA has the power to impose restrictions on the ability of our Australian mortgage insurance business to declare and pay dividends based on a number of factors, including the impact on the minimum regulatory capital ratio of that business. 
 On November 30, 2017, the Australia Government announced the establishment of a Royal Commission that will consider the conduct of Australias Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services industry and to further ensure its financial system is working efficiently and effectively. The Royal Commission delivered its final report on February 4, 2019. At this time, it is too early to determine what impact, if any, the outcome of this Royal Commission will have on our mortgage insurance business in Australia. 
 On August 3, 2018, the Australian Governments Productivity Commission released its final report on Competition in the Australian Financial System, which included findings and recommendations related to mortgage insurance. The government has not yet provided a timeframe on when it will release its response. At this time, it is too early to determine what impact, if any, the outcome of the Productivity Commissions report and recommendations will have on our mortgage insurance business in Australia. 
 As a public company that is traded on the Australian Securities Exchange (the ASX), Genworth Australia is subject to Australian securities laws and regulation, as well as the reporting requirements of the ASX. 
 Other Non-U.S. Insurance Regulation 
 We operate in a number of countries around the world in addition to the United States, Canada and Australia. Generally, our subsidiaries (and in some cases our branches) conducting business in these countries must obtain licenses from local regulatory authorities and satisfy local regulatory requirements, including those relating to rates, forms, capital, reserves and financial reporting.

 Other Laws and Regulations 
 Securities regulation 
 Certain of our U.S. subsidiaries and certain policies, contracts and services offered by them, are subject to regulation under federal and state securities laws and regulations of the SEC, state securities regulators and FINRA. Most of our insurance company separate accounts are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Most of our variable annuity contracts and all of our variable life insurance policies, as well as our FABNs issued by one of our U.S. subsidiaries as part of our registered notes program are registered under the Securities Act of 1933. One of our U.S. subsidiaries is registered and regulated as a broker/dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is a member of, and subject to regulation by FINRA, as well as by various state and local regulators. The registered representatives of our broker/dealer are also regulated by the SEC and FINRA and are subject to applicable state and local laws. 
 These laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investors in the securities markets and generally grant supervisory agencies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict the conduct of business for failure to comply with such laws and regulations. In such event, the possible sanctions that may be imposed include suspension of individual employees, limitations on the activities in which the broker/dealer may engage, suspension or revocation of the investment adviser or broker/dealer registration, censure or fines. We may also be subject to similar laws and regulations in the states and other countries in which we offer the products described above or conduct other securities-related activities. 
 The SEC, FINRA, state attorneys general, other federal offices and the New York Stock Exchange may conduct periodic examinations, in addition to special or targeted examinations of us and/or specific products. These examinations or inquiries may include, but are not necessarily limited to, product disclosures and sales issues, financial and accounting disclosure and operational issues. Often examinations are sweep exams whereby the regulator reviews current issues facing the financial or insurance industry as a whole. 
 Environmental considerations 
 As an owner and operator of real property, we are subject to extensive U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. environmental laws and regulations. Potential environmental liabilities and costs in connection with any required remediation of our properties is also an inherent risk in property ownership and operation. In addition, we hold equity interests in companies, and have made loans secured by properties, that could potentially be subject to environmental liabilities. We routinely have environmental assessments performed with respect to real estate being acquired for investment and real property to be acquired through foreclosure. We cannot provide assurance that unexpected environmental liabilities will not arise. However, based upon information currently available to us, we believe that any costs associated with compliance with environmental laws and regulations or any remediation of such properties will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 ERISA considerations 
 We provide certain products and services to employee benefit plans that are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) or the Internal Revenue Code. As such, our activities are subject to the restrictions imposed by ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code, including the requirement under ERISA that fiduciaries must perform their duties solely in the interests of ERISA plan participants and beneficiaries, and fiduciaries may not cause or permit a covered plan to engage in certain prohibited transactions with persons who have certain relationships with respect to such plans. The applicable provisions of ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code are subject to enforcement by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), the IRS and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. 
 On April 6, 2016, the DOL published its final regulations on the definition of fiduciary for purposes of ERISA and the prohibited transaction rules under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The final regulations, 
 
49 


  among other things, expand the circumstances in which sales personnel, such as insurance agents, are considered fiduciaries with respect to qualified plans and Individual Retirement Accounts. The DOL also issued two new prohibited transaction exemptions (PTEs) and amended several other existing PTEs. The final rule, new exemptions and amendments generally became applicable on June 9, 2017, but the DOL provided an initial compliance transition period until January 1, 2018 for certain provisions of the rule. On June 21, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit issued an order vacating the DOL fiduciary rule. It is possible, however, that the vacated fiduciary rule may be modified and reinstated or otherwise replaced at some point in the future. Therefore, it is not possible to predict what the impact, if any, the new rules may have on our insurance companies, our financial condition or results of operations. 
 USA PATRIOT Act 
 The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the Patriot Act), enacted in response to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and mandates the implementation of various regulations applicable to broker/dealers and other financial services companies, including insurance companies. The Patriot Act seeks to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties who may be involved in terrorism or money laundering. Anti-money laundering laws outside of the United States contain similar provisions. The increased obligations of financial institutions to identify their customers, watch for and report suspicious transactions, respond to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies, and share information with other financial institutions, require the implementation and maintenance of internal practices, procedures and controls. We believe that we have implemented, and that we maintain, appropriate internal practices, procedures and controls to enable us to comply with the provisions of the Patriot Act. Certain additional requirements became applicable under the Patriot Act in May 2006 through a U.S. Treasury regulation which required that certain insurers have anti-money laundering compliance plans in place. We believe our internal practices, procedures and controls comply with these requirements. 
Cybersecurity 
 In October 2018, the SEC issued a report of investigation regarding certain cybersecurity frauds perpetrated against public companies and internal control requirements. Although the SEC determined not to pursue enforcement, the SEC did emphasize the importance of maintaining a system of internal control to mitigate the escalating risks associated with cybersecurity threats. Furthermore, the SEC stressed that companies need to devise and maintain internal controls that reasonably safeguard company and investor assets from cybersecurity frauds, which includes: (i) ensuring transactions are executed in accordance with managements general and specific authorization; and (ii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with managements general or specific authorization. Finally, in light of the ever-growing threats from cybersecurity fraud, internal controls may need to be reassessed or strengthened, and employee training should be enhanced to educate all employees of these threats. 
 In February 2018, the SEC released interpretive guidance on cybersecurity disclosures. The release outlines the views of the SEC on cybersecurity disclosure requirements and provided enhancements to existing cybersecurity guidance. Among the enhancements, was clarifying disclosure controls and procedures to help public companies identify cybersecurity risks and incidents, assess and analyze their implications and make timely disclosures. It also stressed the importance of materiality assessments when considering cybersecurity disclosures, maintaining discipline around insider trading if a cybersecurity event occurs and board oversight of cybersecurity risks. 
 The area of cybersecurity has also come under increased scrutiny by insurance regulators. For example, New Yorks cybersecurity regulation, discussed further below, for financial services institutions, including banking and insurance entities, under its jurisdiction became effective on March 1, 2017, and is being implemented in stages. Among other things, this new regulation requires these entities to establish and maintain a 
 
50 


  cybersecurity program designed to protect consumers private data. In addition, the NAIC adopted the Insurance Data Security Model Law (the Cybersecurity Model Law) on October 24, 2017, which is similar to New Yorks cybersecurity regulation and establishes standards for data security and for the investigation of and notification of insurance commissioners of cybersecurity events involving unauthorized access to, or the misuse of, certain nonpublic information. The Cybersecurity Model Law imposes significant new regulatory burdens intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information systems. 
 In March 2017, the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) issued a cybersecurity regulation specific to financial services companies. The intent of the regulation was to allow cybersecurity programs to match the relevant risks while keeping pace with technological advances and was designed to promote the protection of customer information as well as the information technology systems of companies. This regulation requires companys cybersecurity programs to include; access privileges, application security, policies and procedures for the disposal of nonpublic information, regular cybersecurity awareness training, encryption of nonpublic information and an incident response plan. The incident response plan should be designed to respond to and recover from any cybersecurity event materially affecting the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the companys information system in a timely manner. Notice of a cybersecurity event needs to occur as quickly as possible but no later than 72 hours from the determination of the cybersecurity event. Companies shall also implement and maintain written policies approved by a senior officer of the company to protect its information systems and nonpublic information, appoint a chief information security officer and perform periodic risk assessments. 
 Privacy of Consumer Information 
 In the United States, federal and state laws and regulations require financial institutions, including insurance companies, to protect the security and confidentiality of consumer financial information and to notify consumers about policies and practices relating to the collection and disclosure of consumer information and policies relating to protecting the security and confidentiality of that information. Similarly, federal and state laws and regulations govern the disclosure and security of consumer health information. In particular, regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Trade Commission and various states regulate the disclosure and use of protected health information by health insurers and other covered entities, the physical and procedural safeguards employed to protect the security of that information, and the electronic transmission of such information. From time to time, Congress and state legislatures consider additional legislation relating to privacy and other aspects of consumer information. We cannot predict whether such legislation will be enacted, or what impact, if any, such legislation may have on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the CCPA) was signed into law on June 28, 2018, and amended shortly thereafter on September 12, 2018. The CCPA grants all California residents the right to know what information a business has collected from them and the sourcing and sharing of that information, as well as a right to have a business delete their personal information (with some exceptions). Its definition of personal information is more expansive than those found in other privacy laws applicable to us in the United States. Failure to comply with the CCPA risks regulatory fines, and the law grants a private right of action for any unauthorized disclosure of personal information as a result of failure to maintain reasonable security procedures. The CCPA is expected to become operational on January 1, 2020, but Californias Attorney General is expected to delay enforcement actions until six months after a final regulation is promulgated or July 1, 2020, whichever is sooner. 
 Similar laws and regulations protecting the security and confidentiality of consumer and financial information are also in effect in Canada, Australia and other countries in which we operate. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 3,500 full-time and part-time employees.
