Southern Properties Capital Ltd. a British Virgin Island corporation (“Southern” or “SPC”), is a wholly owned subsidiary of TCI that was incorporated on August 16, 2016 for the purpose of raising funds by issuing debentures that cannot be converted into shares on the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange(“TASE”). Southern operates in the United States and is primarily involved in investing in, developing, constructing and operating income-producing properties of multi-family residential real estate assets. Southern is included in the consolidated financial statements of TCI.
 
On January 1, 2012, the Company’s subsidiary, TCI, entered into a development agreement with Unified Housing Foundation, Inc. (“UHF”) a non-profit corporation that provides management services for the development of residential apartment projects in the future. This development agreement was terminated December 31, 2013. The Company has also invested in surplus cash notes receivables from UHF and has sold several residential apartment properties to UHF in prior years. Due to this ongoing relationship and the significant investment in the performance of the collateral secured under the notes receivable, UHF has been determined to be a related party.
 
On November 19, 2018, TCI executed an agreement between the Macquarie Group (“Macquarie”) and SPC and TCI to create a joint venture, Victory Abode Apartments, LLC (“VAA”) to address existing and future demand for quality multifamily residential housing through acquisition and development of sustainable Class A multifamily housing in focused secondary and tertiary markets. In connection with the formation of the joint venture, SPC and TCI contributed a portfolio of 49 income producing apartment complexes, and 3 development projects in various stages of construction and received cash consideration of $236.8 million. At the time of the transfer of the properties, the joint venture assumed all liabilities of those properties, including mortgage debt to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”).
 
VAA is equally owned and controlled by Abode JVP, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SPC and Summerset Intermediate Holdings 2 LLC (“Summerset”), a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Macquarie.  Pursuant to the Agreement, Abode JVP, LLC and Summerset each own voting and profit participation rights of 50% and 49%, respectively (“Class A Members”).  The remaining 2% of the profit participation interest is held by Daniel J. Moos ARL’s President and Chief Executive Officer (“Class B Member”) who also serves as the Manager of the joint venture. 


ARL through subsidiaries invests in real estate through direct ownership, leases, and partnerships and also invests in mortgage loans on real estate. Our primary business is the acquisition, development and ownership of income-producing residential and commercial real estate. In addition, we opportunistically acquire land for future development in in-fill or high-growth suburban markets. From time to time and when we believe it appropriate to do so, we will also sell land and income-producing properties. We generate revenues by leasing apartment units to residents; and by leasing office, industrial and retail space to various for-profit businesses as well as certain local, state and federal agencies.
 
At December 31, 2018, our income-producing properties (most of which were owned by subsidiaries of TCI) and the newly created joint venture consisted of:
 

● | Seven commercial properties consisting of five office buildings and two retail properties comprising in aggregate of approximately 1.7 million square feet;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Nine residential apartment communities comprising 1,489 units, excluding apartments being developed; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Forty-nine residential apartment communities totaling 9,192 units owned by our 50% owned investee VAA.

We finance our acquisitions primarily through operating cash flow, proceeds from the sale of land and income-producing properties and debt financing primarily in the form of property-specific, first-lien mortgage loans from commercial banks and institutional lenders. We finance our development projects principally with short-term, variable-rate construction loans that are refinanced with the proceeds of long-term, fixed-rate amortizing mortgages when the development has been completed and occupancy has been stabilized. When we sell properties, we may carry a portion of the sales price generally in the form of a short-term, interest bearing seller-financed note receivable, secured by the property being sold. We may also from time to time enter into partnerships or joint ventures with various investors to acquire land or income-producing properties or to sell interests in some of our properties.
 
We join with various third-party development companies to construct residential apartment communities. At December 31, 2018, TCI and VAA each had three apartment projects in development. The third-party developer typically holds a general partner as well as a limited partner interest in a limited partnership formed for the purpose of building a single property while we generally take a limited partner interest in the limited partnership. We may contribute land to the partnership as part of our equity contribution or we may contribute the necessary funds to the partnership to acquire the land. We are required to fund all required equity contributions while the third-party developer is responsible for obtaining construction financing, hiring a general contractor and for the overall management, successful completion and delivery of the project. We generally bear all the economic risks and rewards of ownership in these partnerships and therefore include these partnerships in our consolidated financial statements. The third-party developer is paid a developer fee typically equal to a percentage of the construction costs. When the project reaches stabilized occupancy, we acquire the third-party developer’s partnership interests in exchange for any remaining unpaid developer fees.
 
At December 31, 2018, our apartment projects in development included (dollars in thousands):

(1) Costs include construction hard costs, construction soft costs and loan borrowing costs.
 
We have made investments in a number of large tracts of undeveloped and partially developed land and intend to continue to improve these tracts of land for our own development purposes or make the improvements necessary to ready the land for sale to other developers.

Significant Real Estate Acquisitions/Dispositions and Financings
 
A summary of some of the significant transactions for the year ended December 31, 2018 are discussed below:
 
Purchases
 
ARL purchased through one of its subsidiaries, seven residential apartment communities. A multi-family 80 unit community located in Baton Rouge, LA for a total purchase price of $12 million, paid through a seller’s financing note of $1.9 million, issuance of note payable of $8.6 million, and exercising an option to purchase of $1.5 million paid in the previous year. A multi-family 99 unit residential apartment community located in Mansfield, TX for a total purchase price of $14.8 million, paid through a seller’s financing note of $2.3 million, and an issuance of a note payable of $11.0 million. A multi-family 200 unit residential apartment community located in Gulf Shores, AL for a total purchase price of $18.1 million, paid through an issuance of a note payable of $11.5 million. A multi-family 144 unit residential apartment community located in Beaumont, TX for a total purchase price of $12.3 million. A multi-family 240 unit residential apartment community located in Houma, LA for a total purchase price of $20.1 million. A multi-family 208 unit residential apartment community located in Texarkana, TX for a total purchase price of $14.7 million. A multi-family 160 unit residential apartment community located in Tupelo, MS for a total purchase price of $11.1 million.
Sales
 
For the year ended December 31, 2018, one of our subsidiaries sold 62 acres of land to an independent third party for a total sales price of $3.0 million and recorded a gain of $1.3 million. In the second quarter, a golf course comprising approximately 96.09 acres sold for an aggregate sales price of $2.3 million, out of which, $0.6 million was received in cash and $1.7 million in note receivables. During the first quarter, the Company sold six income-producing properties to a related party for an aggregate purchase price of $8.5 million, out of which, $2.1 million was received in cash and $6.4 million in note receivables. During the fourth quarter, the Company sold one income-producing property to a related party for a purchase price of $2.2 million. No gain or loss was recorded from the sale of income-producing properties.
 
In addition, on November 19, 2018, TCI contributed fifty-two properties to the joint venture VAA in exchange for a voting and profit participation right of 50% and 49%, respectively. In consideration for the contributed properties, the Company received $236.8 million from our joint venture partner Macquarie, and recognized a gain of approximately $154.1 million.

Mercer Crossing
 
In addition to the real estate sales noted above the Company recorded sales from a development project known as Mercer Crossing.
 
At November 2015, our real estate land holdings at Mercer Crossing consisted of land developable into residential homes and commercial projects, located in Farmers Branch, Texas. In November 2015, the Company entered into a sales contract with an unrelated party.  The contract was for all of the developable land owned by the Company. In addition, IOR and ARL also sold land in this transaction. Total consideration for the sale was $75 million. The agreement among the parties to this transaction provides for TCI to hold the subordinated note from the buyer in the amount of $50 million. At the closing, due to the inadequate down payment from the buyer and the level of seller financing involved, the transaction was accounted for under the deposit method. Under the deposit method, no revenue is recognized and the asset sold remains on the books until the criteria for full revenue recognition are met.
 
During the third quarter of 2018, due to significant cumulative sales of real estate to unrelated third parties and cash received by TCI, the criteria for recording full accrual accounting had been met. Through the period ended August 21, 2018 approximately $28.1 million of the assets previously held by the Company were sold, resulting in a gain of $7.5 million.
 
On August 22, 2018 the Company reacquired all the unsold portions of the real estate from the November 2015 transaction for the amount that remained from the original sales price.
 
During the period August 23, 2018 through December 31, 2018 additional Mercer Crossing real estate was sold for $11.7 million resulting in a net gain on sale of real estate of $5.6 million.
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company has approximately 86 acres of land, at various locations that were sold to related parties in multiple transactions.  These transactions are treated as “subject to sales contract” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Due to the related party nature of the transactions TCI has deferred the recording of the sales in accordance with ASC 360-20.
 
We continue to invest in the development of apartment projects. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we have invested $14.8 million related to the construction or predevelopment of various apartment complexes and capitalized $0.1 million of interest costs.
 
Business Plan and Investment Policy
 
Our business objective is to maximize long-term value for our stockholders by investing in residential and commercial real estate through the acquisition, development and ownership of apartments, commercial properties, and land. We intend to achieve this objective through acquiring and developing properties in multiple markets and operating as an industry-leading landlord. We believe this objective will provide the benefits of enhanced investment opportunities, economies of scale and risk diversification, both in terms of geographic market and real estate product type. We believe our objective will also result in continuing access to favorably priced debt and equity capital. In pursuing our business objective, we seek to achieve a combination of internal and external growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet and employing a strategy of financial flexibility. We maximize the value of our apartments and commercial properties by maintaining high occupancy levels while charging competitive rental rates, controlling costs and focusing on tenant retention. We also pursue attractive development opportunities either directly or in partnership with other investors.
 
For our portfolio of commercial properties, we generate increased operating cash flow through annual contractual increases in rental rates under existing leases. We also seek to identify best practices within our industry and across our business units in order to enhance cost savings and gain operating efficiencies. We employ capital improvement and preventive maintenance programs specifically designed to reduce operating costs and increase the long-term value of our real estate investments.

We seek to acquire properties consistent with our business objectives and strategies. We execute our acquisition strategy by purchasing properties which management believes will create stockholder value over the long-term. We will also sell properties when management believes value has been maximized or when a property is no longer considered an investment to be held long-term.
 
We are continuously in various stages of discussions and negotiations with respect to development, acquisition, and disposition projects. The consummation of any current or future development, acquisition, or disposition, if any, and the pace at which any may be completed cannot be assured or predicted.
 
Substantially all of our properties are owned by subsidiary companies, many of which are single-asset entities. This ownership structure permits greater access to financing for individual properties and permits flexibility in negotiating a sale of either the asset or the equity interests in the entity owning the asset. From time-to-time, our subsidiaries have invested in joint ventures with other investors, creating the possibility of risks that do not exist with properties solely owned by an ARL subsidiary. In those instances where other investors are involved, those other investors may have business, economic, or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives, which may in turn require us to make investment decisions different from those if we were the sole owner.
 
Real estate generally cannot be sold quickly. We may not be able to promptly dispose of properties in response to economic or other conditions. To offset this challenge, selective dispositions have been a part of our strategy to maintain an efficient investment portfolio and to provide additional sources of capital. We finance acquisitions through mortgages, internally generated funds, and, to a lesser extent, property sales. Those sources provide the bulk of funds for future acquisitions. We may purchase properties by assuming existing loans secured by the acquired property. When properties are acquired in such a manner, we customarily seek to refinance the asset in order to properly leverage the asset in a manner consistent with our investment objectives.
 
Our businesses are not generally seasonal with regard to real estate investments. Our investment strategy seeks both current income and capital appreciation. Our plan of operation is to continue, to the extent our liquidity permits, to make equity investments in income-producing real estate such as apartments, and commercial properties. We may also invest in the debt or equity securities of real estate-related entities. We intend to pursue higher risk, higher reward investments, such as improved and unimproved land where we can obtain reasonably-priced financing for substantially all of a property’s purchase price. We intend to continue the development of apartment properties in selected markets in Texas and in other locations where we believe adequate levels of demand exist. We intend to pursue sales opportunities for properties in stabilized real estate markets where we believe our properties’ value has been maximized. We also intend to be an opportunistic seller of properties in markets where demand exceeds current supply. Although we no longer actively seek to fund or purchase mortgage loans, we may, in selected instances, originate mortgage loans or we may provide purchase money financing in conjunction with a property sale.
 
Our Board of Directors has broad authority under our governing documents to make all types of investments, and we may devote available resources to particular investments or types of investments without restriction on the amount or percentage of assets that may be allocated to a single investment or to any particular type of investment, and without limit on the percentage of securities of any one issuer that may be acquired. Investment objectives and policies may be changed at any time by the Board without stockholder approval.
 
The specific composition from time-to-time of our real estate portfolio owned by ARL directly and through our subsidiaries depends largely on the judgment of management to changing investment opportunities and the level of risk associated with specific investments or types of investments. We intend to maintain a real estate portfolio that is diversified by both location and type of property.
 
Competition
 
The real estate business is highly competitive and we compete with numerous companies engaged in real estate activities (including certain entities described in Part III, Item 13. “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence”), some of which have greater financial resources than ARL. We believe that success against such competition is dependent upon the geographic location of a property, the performance of property-level managers in areas such as leasing and marketing, collection of rents and control of operating expenses, the amount of new construction in the area and the maintenance and appearance of the property. Additional competitive factors include ease of access to a property, the adequacy of related facilities such as parking and other amenities, and sensitivity to market conditions in determining rent levels. With respect to apartments, competition is also based upon the design and mix of the units and the ability to provide a community atmosphere for the residents. We believe that beyond general economic circumstances and trends, the degree to which properties are renovated or new properties are developed in the competing submarket are also competitive factors. See also Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors”.

 To the extent that ARL seeks to sell any of its properties, the sales prices for the properties may be affected by competition from other real estate owners and financial institutions also attempting to sell properties in areas where ARL’s properties are located, as well as aggressive buyers attempting to dominate or penetrate a particular market.
 
As described above and in Part III, Item 13. “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence,” the officers and directors of ARL serve as officers and directors of TCI and IOR. TCI and IOR have business objectives similar to those of ARL. ARL’s officers and directors owe fiduciary duties to both IOR and TCI as well as to ARL under applicable law. In determining whether a particular investment opportunity will be allocated to ARL, IOR, or TCI, management considers the respective investment objectives of each Company and the appropriateness of a particular investment in light of each Company’s existing real estate and mortgage notes receivable portfolio. To the extent that any particular investment opportunity is appropriate to more than one of the entities, the investment opportunity may be allocated to the entity which has had funds available for investment for the longest period of time, or, if appropriate, the investment may be shared among all three or two of the entities.
 
In addition, as described in Part III, Item 13. “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence,” ARL competes with related parties of Pillar having similar investment objectives related to the acquisition, development, disposition, leasing and financing of real estate and real estate-related investments. In resolving any potential conflicts of interest which may arise, Pillar has informed ARL that it intends to exercise its best judgment as to what is fair and reasonable under the circumstances in accordance with applicable law.
 
We have historically engaged in and will continue to engage in certain business transactions with related parties, including but not limited to asset acquisitions and dispositions. Transactions involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm’s length basis due to the absence of free market forces that naturally exist in business dealings between two or more unrelated entities. Related party transactions may not always be favorable to our business and may include terms, conditions and agreements that are not necessarily beneficial to or in the best interests of the Company.
