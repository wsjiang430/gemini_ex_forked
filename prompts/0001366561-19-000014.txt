Item 1. Business
Overview
We empower everyone to improve how they work. We are a leading cloud-based platform for work execution, enabling teams and organizations to plan, capture, manage, automate, and report on work at scale, resulting in more efficient processes and better business outcomes. As of January 31, 2019, over 95,000 customers, including over 78,000 domain-based customers, relied on Smartsheet to implement, manage, and automate processes across a broad array of departments and use cases. 
The nature of work has changed and most work is unstructured or dynamic. The growing volume and variety of information has complicated the process for executing work across teams that are increasingly multidisciplinary and geographically distributed. Unstructured or dynamic work is work that has historically been managed using a combination of email, spreadsheets, whiteboards, phone calls, and in-person meetings to communicate with team members and complete projects and processes. It is frequently changing, often ad-hoc, and highly reactive to new information. Rigid applications, such as ticketing, enterprise resource planning (“ERP”), or customer relationship management (“CRM”), systems are poorly suited to manage unstructured work. For nearly 30 years, organizations have primarily relied on lightweight tools to manage dynamic or unstructured work. Reliance on these tools limits visibility and accountability, creates information silos that slow decision-making, and results in delays, errors, and suboptimal outcomes.
Business users need technology solutions they can configure and modify on their own. Today, many systems within an enterprise require IT to implement and manage them. Even tools that focus on the business user require some coding knowledge to incorporate business logic for workflows, integrate data from third-party systems, and adapt to changing business needs. 
Smartsheet was founded in 2005 with a vision to build a universal application for work management that does not require coding capabilities. Our platform serves as a single source of truth across work processes and fosters accountability and engagement within teams, leading to more efficient decision-making and better business outcomes. Our platform provides a number of solutions that eliminate the obstacles to capturing information, including a familiar and intuitive spreadsheet interface as well as easily customizable forms. Our reporting and automation capabilities further increase speed by reducing time spent on administration and repetitive work. We make it easy for teams to apply business logic to automate repetitive actions using an extensive list of conditions. Business users, with little or no training, can configure and modify our platform to customize workflows to suit their needs. Our familiar and intuitive user interface and functionality allows users to realize the benefits of our platform without changing the behaviors developed using everyday productivity tools.
People across organizations have similar needs no matter where they work or what they do. They need to manage workflows across teams, gain visibility into progress on a project in real-time, capture inputs, track and report on deliverables, prioritize actions, and provide consistency in processes. Smartsheet is adaptable to manage virtually any type of work. Our customers use Smartsheet for over 2,000 documented use cases, including software migration planning, vendor and contract management, brand launches, compliance reporting, event planning, customer onboarding, budget approvals, patent application processing, talent acquisition, benefit and retirement tracking, sales enablement, pipeline management, sales operations, commissions calculations, marketing programs management, investor relations tracking, and website management, among others.
We have over 95,000 customers, including more than 78,000 domain-based customers, over 90 companies in the Fortune 100, and three-quarters of the companies in the Fortune 500. As of January 31, 2019, our Fortune 100 and Fortune 500 customers had annualized contract values, or ACVs, ranging from $108 to $2.9 million, and approximately half of our Fortune 500 customers had ACVs lower than $5,000 per year. Our customers typically begin using our platform for a single initiative or project. Over time, as users realize the benefits of improved execution, adoption of our platform expands across an organization through new use cases and teams. 
We deliver our cloud-based software platform through a subscription model. We have a digital sales model for self-service adoption through our website. We employ an efficient inside sales team that utilizes machine learning and lead 
5

scoring to respond to and convert other interested users within new and existing organizations. We also have a targeted field sales team dedicated to expanding our presence within existing enterprise relationships where we have identified significant opportunity for growth, and have developed reseller relationships to more efficiently reach international markets. This blended go-to-market model allows us to serve a larger, diverse user base without incurring excessive costs. The breadth of solutions we offer reflects the flexibility our users desire to purchase and use our platform in a way that most closely aligns with their needs and level of adoption.
Our Platform
Our platform is purpose-built to improve work execution for organizations and teams. We provide our customers with a robust set of capabilities to plan, capture, manage, automate, and report on work. Our platform enhances visibility and accountability in work execution and eliminates behaviors and processes that hinder productivity. We designed our platform to be accessible and valuable to all knowledge workers. Business users with no coding ability can share their work in Smartsheet across internal and external teams, and create and modify workflows to address specific use cases with our platform. Smartsheet offers multiple ways for customers to plan and manage their work using grids, projects, cards, and calendars; users can easily toggle between views to support their team’s preferred way of working.
We offer capabilities and functionality to enable teams to accelerate execution while maintaining the flexibility to apply our platform to thousands of documented use cases. During the year ended January 31, 2019, we also launched Accelerators, which are pre-packaged solutions designed as best-in-class solutions to support specific use cases. As of January 31, 2019, we offered five Accelerators, including Information Technology Project Management Office (“IT PMO”), Mergers and Acquisitions (“M&A”), and Customer Engagement.
Benefits of our Platform
Automation across the organization saves time and minimizes manual processing
We enable users to organize their unstructured work and apply business logic to automate actions that shorten work execution timelines without the need to write code. Business logic is used to determine the conditions under which the following types of automated actions occur: update requests, intake and collection of information, sending of information, notifications, approval requests, and automated actions across systems. These elements of automation reduce errors and time spent by teams on administration.
Real-time visibility drives more informed, faster decision-making
Our platform is designed to provide a single source of truth for all stakeholders. We break down information silos across teams and provide real-time visibility into the status of work and the actions required by each stakeholder. This visibility ensures clear ownership of actions and outcomes. Teams feel empowered to take action, leading to stronger engagement and faster time to completion. Line of business managers benefit from visibility into progress against goals, allowing them to react quickly to real-time information and enabling faster and more informed decision-making.
Ease of use enables broad adoption
Our platform is designed for broad adoption within and across organizations for virtually any use case. Users can begin using Smartsheet within minutes and configure our platform for their needs with limited or no training. As of January 31, 2019, we had over 800,000 paying users and over 4.0 million additional free users which we refer to as collaborators. Collaborators inside or outside a user’s organization are invited to work on our platform by a paid user, and can use our platform with limited functionality. This strategy is designed to increase paid conversions for those seeking to enjoy the complete functionality of our platform while promoting greater usage within and across organizations. Teams and organizations buy into our platform because the productivity benefits derived through visibility and accountability are provided to all stakeholders. All team members can access the latest project information from a single location and can be held accountable without manual effort.
Multiple levels of integration to garner the most benefit from Smartsheet and other systems
We enable business users to engage with our platform through systems they currently use. Through our third-party Connectors, we extend the reach and consistency of data from systems, such as those offered by Salesforce, Atlassian, ServiceNow, and Microsoft. Our Connectors also allow users to apply business logic and automated actions, increasing the value of these existing applications to our users. We also integrate our platform into popular document and communication applications from Google, Microsoft, and others. Such functionality enables our users to incorporate documents directly into our platform or access our platform through the application of their choice. In addition, we offer extensible application programming interfaces (“APIs”) that enable a broad ecosystem of partners and customers to 
6

integrate directly into our platform, increasing the value of existing custom-built applications and improving the experience for our users.
Enterprise features and functionality for scalable adoption within businesses
Companies rely on Smartsheet to manage a diverse set of business processes. We provide the scalability, compliance, and security needed to operate reliably for our customers. Our platform provides consistent program execution, enabling teams and organizations to administer programs with management, visibility, and reporting at scale. Customers can use our professional services offerings to create and administer programs for specific use cases. We also provide user management and compliance features that enable organizations to control user access and audit activity within our platform. We provide enterprise-grade security controls and data governance to enable customer compliance with applicable privacy regulations.
Our Growth Strategies
Our goal is to make our platform accessible for every organization, team, and worker relying on collaborative work to achieve successful outcomes. We plan to pursue this goal with the following strategies.
Attract more customers to Smartsheet
We believe the need for a work execution platform such as ours is broad, and we believe there is significant opportunity to grow our paid user base. We will continue to invest in our digital sales model, direct sales force, brand, product, and partner marketing to continue to land new customers and increase enterprise adoption. In addition, we will continue to grow our professional services function, and develop new and enhanced premium solutions like our Connectors, Control Center, and Accelerators to help land larger accounts and increase the scale of our deployments with customers.
Expand within our existing customer base
Our customers frequently increase their use of our platform as they realize the value they derive from adopting Smartsheet. As a result, we are working with customers to help them define new use cases within existing deployments, and expand usage of Smartsheet to additional teams in their organizations that would benefit from our platform. There are more than 4.0 million existing collaborators that we are focused on converting to paid users. In addition to broader deployments, we enable our customers to further derive value from Smartsheet through premium solutions such as our Connectors, Control Center, Dynamic View and Accelerators. Lastly, our professional services, customer success, and training teams provide our customers with implementation, training, and support services to help them expand their use of, and realize the full benefit of, Smartsheet.
Expand internationally
For the year ended January 31, 2019, we derived approximately 24% of our revenue from customers outside the United States. We believe that there is significant opportunity to acquire new customers internationally. Our platform is available in eight languages. By expanding our direct and indirect sales force focused outside of the United States, establishing international sales territories, and partnering with strategic resellers, we plan to grow our international sales. In October 2018, we opened our first international sales office in the U.K. focused on growing our presence within Western Europe.
Expand product features and functionality
We intend to continually increase the value we provide to our customers by investing in extending the capabilities of our platform. We have made, and will continue to make, significant investments in research and development to bolster our existing technology and enhance usability to improve our customers’ productivity. For example, during the year ended January 31, 2019, we launched Accelerators which provide our customers with fast and reliable deployment of Smartsheet across specific use-cases. Many of the high-value solutions that we are developing are intended to be packaged and priced separately from our core user subscriptions.

Make additional investments in partnerships and integrations
To help drive adoption of Smartsheet and deliver value to our customers, we offer extensive embedded functionality at no cost to complement and enhance the use of the most common productivity tools from providers such as Microsoft, Google, Slack, Box, and Dropbox. We offer powerful out-of-the-box Connectors with Salesforce, Atlassian, ServiceNow, and Microsoft that we sell for an additional fee on top of our user-based pricing. We intend to continue to invest in these integrations, develop new partnerships, and enhance our architecture to support a wider range of Connectors with leading enterprise applications to increase the value, awareness, and adoption of our platform.
Pursue selective strategic acquisitions
We plan to pursue strategic acquisitions that we believe will be complementary to our existing offering, enhance our technology, and increase the value proposition we deliver to our customers. Our recent acquisition of Seattle-based TernPro, Inc. (“TernPro”) is an example, as we are planning to leverage TernPro’s content mark-up and approval features to accelerate the delivery of new capabilities to our customers.

Our scalable multi-tenant architecture is designed to provide our customers with highly usable, secure, and reliable functionality.
Extensible technology platform
Our solutions are built on a common core platform that allows us to leverage shared components and services, enabling us to rapidly develop new features and functionalities on our existing platform without re-architecting the infrastructure. This also enables our products to seamlessly integrate with one another and provide our customers with a better user experience while leveraging our platform. We also offer a broad set of APIs that allow our customers the ability to integrate their Smartsheet account with other systems, or build their own applications on top of our extensible platform.
Integrated mobile capabilities
We have invested in our common core framework and mobile development teams to extend the high performance functionality of our platform to smartphones and tablets. Our native mobile applications are built for both iOS and Android, and are designed to provide similar functionality to our desktop version, while also supporting mobile-first customer use cases.
Enterprise-grade security
Our customers frequently use our platform to store and manage highly-sensitive or proprietary information. Our approach to security includes a comprehensive information security program, governing the processing and security of customer information, and the appropriate physical, organizational, and technical controls designed to ensure the security of customer information collected, accessed, stored, or transmitted to or by Smartsheet. To ensure our controls remain up-to-date, we use external auditors to verify the adequacy of security measures and controls according to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”) SOC2 standards. In addition, we use external security experts to conduct penetration testing at least annually and make these audit and penetration test reports available to customers. 
Scalable and reliable infrastructure
Our scalable architecture is designed to provide a highly reliable and available platform. We maintain this reliability by utilizing a combination of third-party co-location centers and large public cloud providers, giving us the ability to scale our infrastructure efficiently and cost-effectively. To ensure our platform is constantly available, we monitor our platform using the latest technologies.

10

Marketing
Our marketing organization is responsible for increasing awareness of, and generating demand for, our platform, and fostering our community of users. We target potential users across a wide variety of departments and functions in organizations of all sizes and industries. We employ content marketing, search marketing, social marketing, influencer marketing, advertising, and other techniques that increase traffic to our website and encourage new users to sign up for a 30-day free trial and purchase our subscription services online. We engage frequently with respected technology analyst firms to educate them as to the benefits of our platform and accelerate the maturation of an appropriate market category.
We have also built marketing relationships with a number of technology companies, such as Microsoft and Google, to help promote and grow our user base and footprint. These partners offer access to our platform through links on their websites and expand our marketing reach. Additionally, we hosted our second annual global customer conference, Smartsheet ENGAGE, in October 2018, to provide current and prospective users a better understanding of our platform through interactions with peers and training, and to highlight customer use cases and best practices.
Sales
Our sales organization is responsible for driving customer expansion and new customer opportunities. Our sales force is organized into separate teams focused on new customers, small to medium-sized businesses, large enterprises, geographic regions, and industries. Our assisted sales model relies on machine learning and lead scoring to identify users based on their likelihood to purchase our platform. Further, once we identify an opportunity for meaningful expansion within a customer organization, we can assign a customer success manager and an expansion sales representative to that customer. When an organization with more than 10,000 employees reaches a certain level of usage, we typically assign a field sales representative who is focused on growing adoption in these large accounts and expanding usage to a broader set of use cases.
Professional Services
Our professional services team provides our customers with implementation, training, and consulting services to help them realize the full benefits of Smartsheet.

These include email and ticket submission for all users at no cost, along with access to phone support and subject matter expert appointments as part of our paid plans.
Customers
Our scalable collaborative work management platform helps teams and organizations of all sizes get work done fast and efficiently. As of January 31, 2019, we had over 78,000 domain-based customers with ACVs ranging from $108 to $2.9 million. We define a domain-based customer as an organization with at least one paid user account associated with a unique domain name such as @cisco. An ISP customer is typically a small team or an individual that registers for our services with an email address hosted on a widely used domain such as @gmail, @outlook, or @yahoo. 
Our domain-based customers include organizations across virtually all sectors, including aerospace, automotive, biotechnology, consumer, e-commerce, education, finance, government, healthcare, IT services, marketing, media, non-profit, publishing, software, technology, and travel.

Our research and development team also includes our technical operations team which is responsible for scaling our platform and maintaining our co-location data centers and public cloud infrastructure. We invest substantial resources in research and development to drive core technology innovation and bring new products to market. 
11

Competition
The market for work execution software is rapidly evolving. We face competition from a number of vendors with a variety of product offerings. Our primary competition remains a combination of manual, email- and spreadsheet-based processes from providers such as Microsoft and Google that users have historically relied on to manage work. Certain of our features compete with current products and services offered by Asana, Atlassian, Planview, and Workfront. In addition, certain companies offer lightweight productivity solutions that compete with some of our platform’s features, including Asana and Workfront. Larger software vendors with substantial resources and smaller upstarts building on new technology platforms may also decide to enter our market by building or acquiring products that compete with our platform. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include:
• ease of deployment and use of applications;
• product features, quality, and functionality;
• ability to automate processes;
• ability to integrate with other applications and systems;
• capability for customization, configurability, integration, security, scalability, and reliability of applications
and solutions;
• vision for the market and product innovation;
• size of customer base and level of user adoption;
• pricing and total cost of ownership;
• strength of sales and marketing efforts;
• brand awareness and reputation; and
• customer experience, including support.
We believe we are positioned favorably against our competitors on the basis of the factors described above. Our ability to remain competitive will largely depend on our ongoing performance and the quality of our platform.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, and trade secrets, as well as contractual provisions and restrictions, to protect our intellectual property. As of January 31, 2019, we had 10 issued patents in the United States that expire between 2019 and 2035, three issued patents internationally, as well as seven pending patent applications in the United States. These patents and patent applications seek to protect proprietary inventions relevant to our business. While we believe our patents and patent applications in the aggregate are important to our competitive position, no single patent or patent application is material to us as a whole. We intend to pursue additional patent protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective.
As of January 31, 2019, we owned two U.S. and 23 international trademark registrations for the mark SMARTSHEET. We also own two pending trademark applications, and several domain names, including www.smartsheet.com.
