ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

General Description of the Business and Operations
Cole Credit Property Trust IV, Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is a non-exchange traded REIT formed as a Maryland corporation on July 27, 2010. We elected to be taxed, and currently qualify, as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2012. We have primarily acquired core commercial real estate assets consisting of necessity retail properties located throughout the United States. We use the term “core” to describe existing properties currently operating and generating income that are leased to creditworthy tenants under long-term net leases and are strategically located. As of December 31, 2018, we owned 890 properties, which includes nine properties owned through a consolidated joint venture arrangement (the “Consolidated Joint Venture”), comprising 26.5 million rentable square feet of commercial space located in 45 states. As of December 31, 2018, the rentable space at these properties was 96.2% leased, including month-to-month agreements, if any. 
In addition to core commercial real estate assets, we intend to also focus on originating, acquiring, financing and managing commercial mortgage loans and other commercial real estate debt investments, commercial mortgage‑backed securities (“CMBS”), corporate credit investments, and other commercial real estate investments in the U.S. As of December 31, 2018, our loan portfolio consisted of four loans with a net book value of $89.8 million. Over the next 12-24 months, we expect, subject to market conditions, to sell a portion of our anchored shopping center portfolio and certain single tenant properties and redeploy the proceeds from those sales into commercial mortgage loans and other credit investments in which our sponsor and its affiliates have expertise.
Substantially all of our business is conducted through our operating partnership, Cole Operating Partnership IV, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (“CR IV OP”), of which we are the sole general partner and own, directly or indirectly, 100% of the partnership interests. 
We are externally managed by Cole REIT Management IV, LLC (“CR IV Management”) (formerly known as Cole REIT Advisors IV, LLC), an affiliate of CIM Group, LLC (“CIM”), a vertically-integrated owner and operator of real assets with multidisciplinary expertise and in-house research, acquisition, credit analysis, development, finance, leasing, and asset management capabilities headquartered in Los Angeles, California with offices in Oakland, California; Bethesda, Maryland; Dallas, Texas; New York, New York; Chicago, Illinois; and Phoenix, Arizona. We have no paid employees and rely upon our advisor and its affiliates to provide substantially all of our day-to-day management. Pursuant to an advisory agreement with us, CR IV Management is responsible for managing our affairs on a day-to-day basis and for identifying and making acquisitions and investments on our behalf. Pursuant to the advisory agreement, CR IV Management has fiduciary obligations to us and our stockholders. Our advisory agreement with CR IV Management is for a one-year term and is considered for renewal on an annual basis by our board of directors (our “Board”). 
On February 1, 2018, CIM acquired CCO Group, LLC and its subsidiaries (collectively, “CCO Group”) from VEREIT Operating Partnership, L.P. (“VEREIT OP”), a subsidiary of VEREIT, Inc. (“VEREIT”) (the “Transaction”). CCO Group, LLC owns and controls CR IV Management, our advisor, and is the indirect owner of CCO Capital, LLC (“CCO Capital”), our dealer manager, and CREI Advisors, LLC (“CREI Advisors”), our property manager. CCO Group serves as our sponsor and as a sponsor to Cole Credit Property Trust V, Inc. (“CCPT V”), Cole Office & Industrial REIT (CCIT II), Inc. (“CCIT II”), Cole Office & Industrial REIT (CCIT III), Inc. (“CCIT III”), and CIM Income NAV, Inc. (formerly known as Cole Real Estate Income Strategy (Daily NAV), Inc.) (“CIM Income NAV”). 
As part of the Transaction, VEREIT OP and CCO Group, LLC entered into a services agreement (the “Services Agreement”) pursuant to which VEREIT OP is obligated to provide certain services to CCO Group and to us through March 31, 2019 (or, if later, the date of the last government filing other than a tax filing made by us, CCPT V, CCIT II, CCIT III and/or CIM Income NAV with respect to its 2018 fiscal year) (the “Initial Services Term”) and is obligated to provide consulting and research services through December 31, 2023 as requested by CCO Group, LLC. The services provided by VEREIT OP during the Initial Services Term, including but not limited to any advisory, dealer manager and property management services, have been, or by March 31, 2019, will be, transitioned to, and will be provided directly by, our sponsor, advisor, dealer manager or an affiliate thereof. 
On January 26, 2012, we commenced our initial public offering on a “best efforts” basis of up to a maximum of $2.975 billion in shares of common stock (the “Offering”). On November 25, 2013, we reallocated $400.0 million in shares from our distribution reinvestment plan (the “DRIP”) portion of the Offering to the primary offering, and on February 18, 2014, we reallocated an additional $23.0 million in shares from the DRIP portion of the Offering to the primary offering. As a result of these reallocations, the Offering offered up to a maximum of approximately 292.3 million shares of our common stock at a 
4

price of $10.00 per share, and up to approximately 5.5 million additional shares pursuant to the DRIP under which our stockholders could have elected to have distributions reinvested in additional shares of common stock at a price of $9.50 per share.
We terminated the Offering on April 4, 2014. At the completion of the Offering, a total of approximately 297.4 million shares of common stock had been issued, including approximately 292.3 million shares of common stock sold to the public pursuant to the primary portion of the Offering and approximately 5.1 million shares of common stock sold pursuant to the DRIP portion of the Offering. The remaining approximately 404,000 unsold shares from the Offering were deregistered.
In addition, we registered $247.0 million in shares of common stock under the DRIP (the “Initial DRIP Offering”) on December 19, 2013. We ceased issuing shares under the Initial DRIP Offering effective as of June 30, 2016. At the completion of the Initial DRIP Offering, a total of approximately $241.7 million of common stock had been issued. The remaining $5.3 million of unsold shares from the Initial DRIP Offering were deregistered.
We registered an additional $600.0 million of shares of common stock under the DRIP (the “Secondary DRIP Offering,” and together with the Initial DRIP Offering, the “DRIP Offerings,” and the DRIP Offerings collectively with the Offering, the “Offerings”), on August 2, 2016. We have issued and will continue to issue shares of common stock under the Secondary DRIP Offering. 
As of December 31, 2018, we had issued approximately 348.8 million shares of our common stock in the Offerings, including 50.5 million shares issued in the DRIP Offerings, for gross offering proceeds of $3.5 billion before organization and offering costs, selling commissions and dealer manager fees of $306.0 million.
The Board establishes an estimated per share net asset value (“NAV”) of the Company’s common stock for purposes of assisting broker-dealers that participated in the Offering in meeting their customer account statement reporting obligations under National Association of Securities Dealers Conduct Rule 2340. The following table summarizes the estimated per share NAV of our common stock for the periods indicated below:

Valuation Date | Period Commencing | Period Ending | NAV per Share
August 31, 2015 | October 1, 2015 | November 13, 2016 | $ | 9.70 
September 30, 2016 | November 14, 2016 | March 27, 2017 | $ | 9.92 
December 31, 2016 | March 28, 2017 | March 28, 2018 | $ | 10.08
December 31, 2017 | March 29, 2018 | March 19, 2019 | $ | 9.37 
December 31, 2018 | March 26, 2019 | — | $ | 8.65 

Distributions are reinvested in shares of our common stock under the DRIP at the most recent estimated per share NAV as determined by our Board. Commencing on March 26, 2019, following our Board’s determination of an updated estimated per share NAV, distributions will be reinvested in shares of our common stock under the DRIP at a price of $8.65 per share, the estimated per share NAV as of December 31, 2018, as determined by our Board. Additionally, $8.65 per share will serve as the most recent estimated per share NAV for purposes of the share redemption program.
Investment Strategy and Objectives
Our primary investment objectives are:

• | to acquire quality commercial real estate properties, net leased under long-term leases to creditworthy tenants, which provide current operating cash flow;


• | to originate and acquire credit investments, including real estate debt investments, CMBS and corporate credit investments;


• | to provide reasonably stable, current income for stockholders through the payment of cash distributions; and


• | to provide the opportunity to participate in capital appreciation in the value of our investments.

Acquisition and Investment Policies 
Our charter requires that our independent directors review our investment policies, described below, at least annually to determine that our policies are in the best interests of our stockholders. Except to the extent that investment policies and limitations are included in our charter, our Board may revise our investment policies without the approval of our stockholders. Investment policies that are provided in our charter may only be amended by a vote of stockholders holding a majority of our outstanding shares, unless the amendments do not adversely affect the rights, preferences and privileges of our stockholders.

Types of Investments — Real Estate Properties
We have acquired income-producing necessity retail properties that are primarily single-tenant properties or anchored shopping centers, which are leased to creditworthy tenants under long-term net leases, and are strategically located throughout the United States. We consider necessity retail properties to be properties leased to retail tenants that attract consumers for everyday needs, such as pharmacies, home improvement stores, national superstores, restaurants and regional retailers. Anchored shopping centers are multi-tenant properties that are anchored by one or more large national, regional or local retailers.
We have and may continue to acquire other income-producing properties, such as office and industrial properties, which may share certain core characteristics with our retail investments, such as a principal creditworthy tenant, a long-term net lease, and a strategic location. We believe acquisitions of these types of office and industrial properties, which are essential to the business operations of the tenant, are consistent with our goal of providing stockholders with a stable stream of current income and an opportunity for capital appreciation. 
Many of our properties are, and we anticipate that future properties will be, leased to tenants in the chain or franchise retail industry, including, but not limited to, convenience stores, drug stores and restaurant properties, as well as leased to large national retailers as standalone properties or as part of anchored shopping centers, which are anchored by national, regional and local retailers. CR IV Management monitors industry trends and identifies properties on our behalf that serve to provide a favorable return balanced with risk. Our management primarily targets regional or national name brand retail businesses with established track records. We generally intend to hold each property for a period in excess of five years. 
By acquiring a large number of properties, we believe that lower than expected results of operations from one or a few investments will not necessarily preclude our ability to realize our investment objective of cash flow from our overall portfolio. In addition, we believe that properties under long-term triple-net and double-net leases offer a distinct investment advantage since these properties generally require less management and operating capital, have less recurring tenant turnover and, with respect to single-tenant properties, often offer superior locations that are less dependent on the financial stability of adjoining tenants. Since we acquire properties that are geographically diverse, we expect to minimize the potential adverse impact of economic slowdowns or downturns in local markets.
To the extent feasible, we seek to achieve a well-balanced portfolio diversified by geographic location, age and lease maturities of the various properties. We pursue properties leased to tenants representing a variety of retail industries to avoid concentration in any one industry. We also are diversified between national, regional and local brands. We generally target properties with lease terms in excess of ten years. We have acquired and may continue to acquire properties with shorter lease terms if the property is in an attractive location, if the property is difficult to replace, or if the property has other significant favorable attributes. We expect that these acquisitions will provide long-term value by virtue of their size, location, quality and condition, and lease characteristics. 
There is no limitation on the number, size or type of properties that we may acquire, or on the percentage of net proceeds of the Offerings that may be used to acquire a single property. The number and mix of properties comprising our portfolio will depend upon real estate market conditions and other circumstances existing at the time we acquire properties, and the amount of capital we have available for acquisitions. We will not forgo acquiring a high-quality asset because it does not precisely fit our expected portfolio composition. See “— Other Possible Investments” below for a description of other types of real estate and real estate-related investments we may make. 
We incur debt to acquire properties when CR IV Management determines that incurring such debt is in our best interests and in the best interests of our stockholders. In addition, from time to time, we have acquired and may continue to acquire some properties without financing and later incur mortgage debt secured by one or more of such properties if favorable financing terms are available. We use the proceeds from these loans to acquire additional properties. See “— Borrowing Policies” below for a more detailed description of our borrowing intentions and limitations.
Types of Investments — Credit Investments
Although we have acquired primarily real estate assets, we have acquired, and expect to continue to acquire, certain credit investments, including real estate-related assets, such as mortgage, mezzanine, bridge and other loans and securities related to real estate assets, frequently, but not necessarily always, in the corporate sector. We will evaluate our assets to ensure that any such investments do not cause us to lose our REIT status or cause us or any of our subsidiaries to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). Thus, to the extent that CR IV Management presents us with high quality investment opportunities that allow us to meet the REIT requirements under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”), and do not cause us, our operating partnership or 
6

any other subsidiaries to meet the definition of an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act, we expect our portfolio composition will include such credit investments.
Investing in and Originating Loans. The criteria that CR IV Management will use in making or investing in loans on our behalf are substantially the same as those involved in acquiring properties for our portfolio. We do not intend to make loans to other persons or to underwrite securities of other issuers. However, unlike our property acquisitions, which we expect to hold in excess of five years, we expect that the average duration of loans will typically be one to five years. 
We will not make or invest in mortgage loans on any one property if the aggregate amount of all mortgage loans outstanding on the property, including our loan, would exceed an amount equal to 85% of the appraised value of the property, as determined by an independent third-party appraiser, unless we find substantial justification due to other underwriting criteria. We may find such justification in connection with the purchase of loans in cases in which we believe there is a high probability of our foreclosure upon the property in order to acquire the underlying assets and in which the cost of the loan investment does not exceed the fair market value of the underlying property. We will not invest in or make loans unless an appraisal has been obtained concerning the underlying property, except for those loans insured or guaranteed by a government or government agency. In cases in which a majority of our independent directors so determine, and in the event the transaction is with CCO Group, CR IV Management, any of our directors or their respective affiliates, the appraisal will be obtained from a certified independent appraiser in order to support its determination of fair market value. 
We may invest in first, second and third mortgage loans, mezzanine loans, bridge loans, wraparound mortgage loans, construction mortgage loans on real property and loans on leasehold interest mortgages. However, we will not make or invest in any loans that are subordinate to any mortgage or equity interest of CCO Group, CR IV Management, any of our directors or any of their or our affiliates. We also may invest in participations in mortgage loans. A mezzanine loan is a loan made in respect of certain real property but is secured by a lien on the ownership interests of the entity that, directly or indirectly, owns the real property. A bridge loan is short-term financing for an individual or business, until permanent or the next stage of financing can be obtained. Second mortgage and wraparound loans are secured by second or wraparound deeds of trust on real property that is already subject to prior mortgage indebtedness. A wraparound loan is one or more junior mortgage loans having a principal amount equal to the outstanding balance under the existing mortgage loan, plus the amount actually to be advanced under the wraparound mortgage loan. Under a wraparound loan, we would generally make principal and interest payments on behalf of the borrower to the holders of the prior mortgage loans. Third mortgage loans are secured by third deeds of trust on real property that is already subject to prior first and second mortgage indebtedness. Construction loans are loans made for either original development or renovation of property. Construction loans in which we would generally consider an investment would be secured by first deeds of trust on real property for terms of six months to two years. Loans on leasehold interests are secured by an assignment of the borrower’s leasehold interest in the particular real property. These loans are generally for terms of six months to 15 years. The leasehold interest loans are either amortized over a period that is shorter than the lease term or have a maturity date prior to the date the lease terminates. These loans would generally permit us to cure any default under the lease. Participations in mortgage loans are investments in partial interests of mortgages of the type described above that are made and administered by third-party mortgage lenders. 
In evaluating prospective loan investments, CR IV Management will consider factors such as the following:
•the ratio of the investment amount to the underlying property’s value;
•the property’s potential for capital appreciation;
•expected levels of rental and occupancy rates;
•the condition and use of the property;
•current and projected cash flow of the property;
•potential for rent increases;
•the degree of liquidity of the investment;
•the property’s income-producing capacity;
•the quality, experience and creditworthiness of the borrower;
•general economic conditions in the area where the property is located;
•in the case of mezzanine loans, the ability to acquire the underlying real property; and
•other factors that CR IV Management believes are relevant.
In addition, we will seek to obtain a customary lender’s title insurance policy or commitment as to the priority of the mortgage or condition of the title. Because the factors considered, including the specific weight we place on each factor, will 
7

vary for each prospective loan investment, we do not, and are not able to, assign a specific weight or level of importance to any particular factor.
We may originate loans from mortgage brokers or personal solicitations of suitable borrowers, or may purchase existing loans that were originated by other lenders. CR IV Management will evaluate all potential loan investments to determine if the security for the loan and the loan-to-value ratio meets our investment criteria and objectives. Most loans that we will consider for investment would provide for monthly payments of interest and some may also provide for principal amortization, although many loans of the nature that we will consider provide for payments of interest only and a payment of principal in full at the end of the loan term. We will not originate loans with negative amortization provisions. 
We do not have any policies directing the portion of our assets that may be invested in construction loans, mezzanine loans, bridge loans, loans secured by leasehold interests and second, third and wraparound mortgage loans. However, we recognize that these types of loans are more subject to risk than first deeds of trust or first priority mortgages on income-producing, fee-simple properties, and we expect to minimize the amount of these types of loans in our portfolio, to the extent that we make or invest in loans at all. CR IV Management will evaluate the fact that these types of loans are riskier in determining the rate of interest on the loans. We do not have any policy that limits the amount that we may invest in any single loan or the amount we may invest in loans to any one borrower. We are not limited as to the amount of gross offering proceeds that we may use to invest in or originate loans.
Our loan investments may be subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities and subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions, including among other things, regulating credit granting activities, establishing maximum interest rates and finance charges, requiring disclosures to customers, governing secured transactions and setting collection, repossession and claims handling procedures and other trade practices. In addition, certain states have enacted legislation requiring the licensing of mortgage bankers or other lenders and these requirements may affect our ability to effectuate our proposed investments in loans. Commencement of operations in these or other jurisdictions may be dependent upon a finding of our financial responsibility, character and fitness. We may determine not to make loans in any jurisdiction in which the regulatory authority determines that we have not complied in all material respects with applicable requirements. 
Investment in Other Real Estate-Related Securities. Subject to the limitations set forth in our charter, we may invest in real estate-related assets, including CMBS, mortgage, mezzanine, bridge and other loans and securities related to real estate assets. We may also invest in common and preferred real estate-related equity securities of both publicly traded and private real estate companies, which are generally unsecured and also may be subordinated to other obligations of the issuer. We would invest in equity securities that are not listed on a national securities exchange or traded in an over-the-counter market only if a majority of our directors (including a majority of our independent directors) not otherwise interested in the transaction approve such investment as being fair, competitive and commercially reasonable. Our investments in other real estate-related securities will involve special risks relating to the particular issuer of the securities, including the financial condition and business outlook of the issuer. 
Investments in Corporate Loans. We may also invest in or originate certain corporate loans, including first lien and senior secured instruments. Our investments in corporate loans will involve special risks relating to the particular issuer of the loans, including the financial condition and business outlook of the issuer.
Real Estate Underwriting Process
In evaluating potential property acquisitions consistent with our investment objectives, CR IV Management applies a well-established underwriting process to determine the creditworthiness of potential tenants. We consider a tenant to be creditworthy if we believe that the tenant has sufficient assets, cash flow generation and stability of operations to meet its obligations under the lease. Similarly, CR IV Management applies credit underwriting criteria to possible new tenants when we are leasing properties in our portfolio. Many of the tenants of our properties are, and we expect will continue to be, national or regional retail chains that are creditworthy entities having high net worth and operating income. CR IV Management’s underwriting process includes analyzing the financial data and other available information about the tenant, such as income statements, balance sheets, net worth, cash flow, business plans, data provided by industry credit rating services, and/or other information CR IV Management may deem relevant. Generally, these tenants must have a proven track record in order to meet the credit tests applied by CR IV Management. In addition, we may obtain guarantees of leases by the corporate parent of the tenant, in which case CR IV Management will analyze the creditworthiness of the guarantor. In many instances, especially in sale-leaseback situations where we are acquiring a property from a company and simultaneously leasing it back to the company under a long-term lease, we will meet with such company’s senior management to discuss the company’s business plan and strategy.

When using debt rating agencies, a tenant typically will be considered creditworthy when the tenant has an “investment grade” debt rating by Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) of Baa3 or better, credit rating by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC (“Standard & Poor’s”) of BBB- or better, or its payments are guaranteed by a company with such rating. Changes in tenant credit ratings, coupled with future acquisition and disposition activity, may increase or decrease our concentration of creditworthy tenants in the future. 
Moody’s ratings are forward-looking opinions of future relative creditworthiness, which consider, but are not limited to, franchise value, financial statement analysis and management quality. The rating given to a debt obligation describes the level of risk associated with receiving full and timely payment of principal and interest on that specific debt obligation and how that risk compares with that of all other debt obligations. The rating, therefore, provides one measure of the ability of a company to generate cash in the future. 
A Moody’s debt rating of Baa3, which is the lowest investment grade rating given by Moody’s, is assigned to companies which, in Moody’s opinion, are subject to moderate credit risk and, as such, may possess certain speculative characteristics. A Moody’s debt rating of AAA, which is the highest investment grade rating given by Moody’s, is assigned to companies which, in Moody’s opinion, are of the highest quality and subject to the lowest level of credit risk.
Standard & Poor’s assigns a credit rating to companies and to each issuance or class of debt issued by a rated company. A Standard & Poor’s credit rating of BBB-, which is the lowest investment grade rating given by Standard & Poor’s, is assigned to companies that, in Standard & Poor’s opinion, exhibit adequate protection parameters. However, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the company to meet its financial commitments. A Standard & Poor’s credit rating of AAA+, which is the highest investment grade rating given by Standard & Poor’s, is assigned to companies that, in Standard & Poor’s opinion, have extremely strong capacities to meet their financial commitments. 
While we will utilize ratings by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s as one factor in determining whether a tenant is creditworthy, CR IV Management also considers other factors in determining whether a tenant is creditworthy for the purpose of meeting our investment objectives. CR IV Management’s underwriting process considers information provided by third-party analytical services, along with CR IV Management’s own analysis of the financial condition of the tenant and/or the guarantor, the operating history of the property with the tenant, the tenant’s market share and track record within the tenant’s industry segment, the general health and outlook of the tenant’s industry segment, the strength of the tenant’s management team and the terms and length of the lease at the time of the acquisition. 
Description of Leases
We expect, in most instances, to continue to acquire properties with existing double-net or triple-net leases. “Net” leases mean leases that typically require tenants to pay all or a majority of the operating expenses, including real estate taxes, special assessments and sales and use taxes, utilities, maintenance, insurance and building repairs related to the property, in addition to the lease payments. Triple-net leases typically require the tenant to pay all costs associated with a property (e.g., real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and repairs, including roof, structure and parking lot). Double-net leases typically hold the landlord responsible for the capital expenditures for the roof and structure, while the tenant is responsible for all lease payments and remaining operating expenses associated with the property (e.g., real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance). We expect that double-net and triple-net leases will help ensure the predictability and stability of our expenses, which we believe will result in greater predictability and stability of our cash distributions to stockholders. Not all of our properties are, or will be subject to, net leases. In respect of anchored shopping centers, we expect to continue to have a variety of lease arrangements with the tenants of these properties. Since each lease is an individually negotiated contract between two or more parties, each lease will have different obligations of both the landlord and tenant. Many large national tenants have standard lease forms that generally do not vary from property to property. We will have limited ability to revise the terms of leases to those tenants. We have acquired and may continue to acquire properties with tenants subject to “gross” leases. “Gross” leases means leases that typically require the tenant to pay a flat rental amount and we would pay for all property charges regularly incurred as a result of our owning the property. When spaces in a property become vacant, existing leases expire, or we acquire properties under development or requiring substantial refurbishment or renovation, we generally expect to enter into net leases. 
We generally expect to enter into long-term leases that have terms of ten years or more; however, certain leases may have a shorter term. We may continue to acquire properties under which the lease term has partially expired. We also may acquire properties with shorter lease terms if the property is in an attractive location, if the property is difficult to replace, or if the property has other significant favorable real estate attributes. Under most commercial leases, tenants are obligated to pay a predetermined annual base rent. Some of the leases also contain provisions that increase the amount of base rent payable at points during the lease term. We expect that many of our leases will continue to contain periodic rent increases. Generally, the leases require each tenant to procure, at its own expense, commercial general liability insurance, as well as property insurance 
9

covering the building for the full replacement value and naming the ownership entity and the lender, if applicable, as the additional insured on the policy. Tenants will be required to provide proof of insurance by furnishing evidence of insurance to CR IV Management on an annual basis. The evidence of insurance will be tracked and reviewed for compliance by CR IV Management personnel responsible for property and risk management. As a precautionary measure, we may obtain, to the extent available, secondary liability insurance, as well as loss of rents insurance that will typically cover one year of annual rent in the event of a rental loss. 
Some leases may require that we procure insurance for both commercial general liability and property damage; however, generally the premiums are fully reimbursable from the tenant. In such instances, the policy will list us as the named insured and the tenant as the additional insured. 
We do not expect to allow leases to be assigned or subleased without our prior written consent. If we do consent to an assignment or sublease, we generally expect the terms of such consent to provide that the original tenant remains fully liable under the lease unless we release that original tenant from its obligations.
We have entered, and may in the future enter, into sale-leaseback transactions, pursuant to which we purchase properties and lease them back to the sellers of such properties. While we intend to use our best efforts to structure any such sale-leaseback transaction so that the lease will be characterized as a “true lease” and so that we are treated as the owner of the property for federal income tax purposes, the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) could challenge this characterization. In the event that any sale-leaseback transaction is re-characterized as a financing transaction for federal income tax purposes, deductions for depreciation and cost recovery relating to such property would be disallowed, and in certain circumstances, we could lose our REIT status.
Acquisition Decisions
CR IV Management has substantial discretion with respect to the selection of our specific acquisitions, subject to our investment and borrowing policies, which are approved by our Board. In pursuing our investment objectives and making investment decisions on our behalf, CR IV Management evaluates the proposed terms of the acquisition against all aspects of the transaction, including the condition and financial performance of the asset, the terms of existing leases and the creditworthiness of the tenant, and property location and characteristics. Because the factors considered, including the specific weight we place on each factor, vary for each potential acquisition, we do not, and are not able to, assign a specific weight or level of importance to any particular factor. 
CR IV Management procures and reviews an independent valuation estimate on each and every proposed acquisition. In addition, CR IV Management, to the extent such information is available, considers the following: 

• | tenant rolls and tenant creditworthiness;


• | a property condition report;


• | unit level store performance;


• | property location, visibility and access;


• | age of the property, physical condition and curb appeal;


• | neighboring property uses;


• | local market conditions including vacancy rates and market rents;


• | area demographics, including trade area population and average household income;


• | neighborhood growth patterns and economic conditions;


• | presence of nearby properties that may positively or negatively impact store sales at the subject property; and


• | lease terms, including length of lease term, scope of landlord responsibilities, presence and frequency of contractual rental increases, renewal option provisions, exclusive and permitted use provisions, co-tenancy requirements and termination options.

CR IV Management also reviews the terms of each existing lease by considering various factors, including: 
•rent escalations;
•remaining lease term;
•renewal option terms;
•tenant purchase options;
•termination options;
10

•scope of the landlord’s maintenance, repair and replacement requirements;
•projected net cash flow yield; and
•projected internal rates of return.
The Board has adopted a policy to prohibit acquisitions from affiliates of CR IV Management unless a majority of our directors (including a majority of our independent directors) not otherwise interested in the transaction determine that the transaction is fair and reasonable to us and certain other conditions are met. See the section captioned “— Acquisition of Properties from Affiliates of CR IV Management” below.
Conditions to Closing Our Acquisitions
Generally, we condition our obligation to close the purchase of any acquisition on the delivery and verification of certain documents from the seller or developer, including, where appropriate: 

• | plans and specifications;


• | surveys;


• | evidence that title to the property can be freely sold or otherwise transferred to us, subject to such liens and encumbrances as are acceptable to CR IV Management;


• | financial statements covering recent operations of properties, if available;


• | title and liability insurance policies; and


• | certificates of the tenant attesting that the tenant believes that, among other things, the lease is valid and enforceable.

In addition, we will take such steps as we deem necessary with respect to potential environmental matters. See the section captioned “Environmental Matters” below. 
We have and may continue to enter into purchase and sale arrangements with a seller or developer of a suitable property under development or construction. In such cases, we are obligated to purchase the property at the completion of construction, provided that the construction conforms to definitive plans, specifications, and costs approved by us in advance. In such cases, prior to our acquiring the property, we generally receive a certificate of an architect, engineer or other appropriate party, stating that the property complies with all plans and specifications. If renovation or remodeling is required prior to the purchase of a property, we expect to pay a negotiated maximum amount to the seller upon completion. 
In determining whether to purchase a particular property, we may, in accordance with customary practices, obtain an option to purchase such property. The amount paid for an option, if any, normally is forfeited if the property is not purchased and credited against the purchase price if the property is purchased. 
In the purchasing, leasing and development of properties, we are subject to risks generally incident to the ownership of real estate. Refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors — General Risks Related to Real Estate Assets in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Ownership Structure
Our real estate acquisitions generally take the form of holding fee title or a long-term leasehold estate. We have acquired, and expect to continue to acquire, such interests either directly through our operating partnership or indirectly through limited liability companies, limited partnerships or other entities owned and/or controlled by us or our operating partnership. We have acquired and may continue to acquire properties by acquiring the entity that holds the desired properties. We also have acquired and may continue to acquire properties through investments in joint ventures, partnerships, co-tenancies or other co-ownership arrangements with third parties, including the developers of the properties or affiliates of CR IV Management. See the section captioned “— Joint Ventures” below.
Joint Ventures
We have entered, and may continue to enter into, joint ventures, partnerships, co-tenancies and other co-ownership arrangements with affiliated entities of CR IV Management, including other real estate programs sponsored or operated by CCO Group, or other affiliates of CR IV Management, and other third parties for the acquisition, development or improvement of properties or the acquisition of other real estate-related assets. We may also enter into such arrangements with real estate developers, owners and other unaffiliated third parties for the purpose of developing, owning and operating real properties. In determining whether to participate in a particular joint venture, CR IV Management will evaluate the underlying real property or other real estate-related asset using the same criteria described above in “— Acquisition Decisions.” CR IV Management 
11

also will evaluate the joint venture or co-ownership partner and the proposed terms of the joint venture or a co-ownership arrangement. 
Our general policy is to invest in joint ventures only when we will have an option or contract to purchase, or a right of first refusal to purchase, the property held by the joint venture or the co-venturer’s interest in the joint venture if the co-venturer elects to sell such interest. In the event that the co-venturer elects to sell all or a portion of the interests held in any such joint venture, however, we may not have sufficient funds to exercise our right of first refusal to buy the other co-venturer’s interest in the joint venture. In the event that any joint venture with an affiliated entity holds interests in more than one asset, the interest in each such asset may be specially allocated between us and the joint venture partner based upon the respective proportion of funds deemed contributed by each co-venturer in each such asset. 
In the event we enter into a joint venture or other co-ownership arrangements with CIM or its affiliates or another real estate program sponsored or operated by CCO Group, CR IV Management’s officers, key persons and affiliates may have conflicts of interest. The co-venturer may have economic or business interests or goals that are or may become inconsistent with our business interests or goals. In addition, CR IV Management’s officers and key persons may face a conflict in structuring the terms of the relationship between our interests and the interests of any affiliated co-venturer and in managing the joint venture. Since some or all of CR IV Management’s officers and key persons may also advise the affiliated co-venturer, agreements and transactions between us and CIM or any other real estate programs sponsored or operated by CCO Group would not have the benefit of arm’s-length negotiation of the type normally conducted between unrelated co-venturers, which may result in the co-venturer receiving benefits greater than the benefits that we receive. In addition, we may assume liabilities related to the joint venture that exceed the percentage of our contribution to the joint venture.
We may enter into joint ventures with CIM, other real estate programs sponsored or operated by CCO Group, CR IV Management, one or more of our directors, or any of their respective affiliates, but only if a majority of our directors (including a majority of our independent directors) not otherwise interested in the transaction approve the transaction as being fair and reasonable to us and on substantially the same terms and conditions as those received by unaffiliated joint venturers, and the cost of our investment must be supported by a current third-party appraisal of the asset.
Development and Construction of Properties
We have acquired and may continue to acquire properties on which improvements are to be constructed or completed or which require substantial renovation or refurbishment. We expect that joint ventures would be the exclusive vehicle through which we would invest in build-to-suit property projects. Our general policy is to structure them as follows: 

• | we may enter into a joint venture with third parties who have an executed lease with the developer who has an executed lease in place with the future tenant whereby we will provide a portion of the equity or debt financing;


• | we would accrue a preferred return during construction on any equity investment;


• | the properties would be developed by third parties; and


• | consistent with our general policy regarding joint ventures, we would have an option or contract to purchase, or a right of first refusal to purchase, the property or the co-investor’s interest.

It is possible that joint venture partners may resist granting us a right of first refusal or may insist on a different methodology for unwinding the joint venture if one of the parties wishes to liquidate its interest. 
In the event that we elect to engage in development or construction projects, in order to help ensure performance by the builders of properties that are under construction, completion of such properties will be guaranteed at the contracted price by a completion guaranty, completion bond or performance bond. CR IV Management may rely upon the substantial net worth of the contractor or developer or a personal guarantee accompanied by financial statements showing a substantial net worth provided by an affiliate of the person entering into the construction or development contract as an alternative to a completion bond or performance bond. Development of real estate properties is subject to risks relating to a builder’s ability to control construction costs or to build in conformity with plans, specifications and timetables. Refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors — General Risks Related to Real Estate Assets in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We have and may continue to make periodic progress payments or other cash advances to developers and builders of our properties prior to completion of construction, but only upon receipt of an architect’s certification as to the percentage of the project then completed and as to the dollar amount of the construction then completed. We intend to use such additional controls on disbursements to builders and developers as we deem necessary or prudent. We have and may continue to directly employ one or more project managers, including CR IV Management or an affiliate of CR IV Management, to plan, supervise and implement the development of any unimproved properties that we may acquire. Such persons would be compensated directly by us or through an affiliate of CR IV Management and reimbursed by us. In either event, the compensation would 
12

reduce the amount of any construction fee, development fee or acquisition fee that we would otherwise pay to CR IV Management or its affiliate. 
In addition, we have and may continue to acquire unimproved properties, provided that we will not invest more than 10% of our total assets in unimproved properties or invest in mortgage loans secured by such properties. We will consider a property to be an unimproved property if it was not acquired for the purpose of producing rental or other operating cash flows, has no development or construction in process at the time of acquisition and no development or construction is planned to commence within one year of the acquisition. 
Borrowing Policies
CR IV Management believes that utilizing borrowings to make acquisitions is consistent with our investment objective of maximizing the return to stockholders. By operating on a leveraged basis, we have more funds available for acquiring properties. This allows us to make more investments than would otherwise be possible, potentially resulting in a more diversified portfolio. 
At the same time, CR IV Management believes in utilizing leverage in a moderate fashion. While there is no limitation on the amount we may borrow against any single improved property, our charter limits our aggregate borrowings to 75% of the cost of our gross assets (or 300% of net assets) (before deducting depreciation or other non-cash reserves) unless excess borrowing is approved by a majority of the independent directors and disclosed to our stockholders in the next quarterly report along with the justification for such excess borrowing. Consistent with CR IV Management’s approach toward the moderate use of leverage, our Board has adopted a policy to further limit our borrowings to 60% of the greater of cost (before deducting depreciation or other non-cash reserves) or fair market value of our gross assets, unless excess borrowing is approved by a majority of the independent directors and disclosed to our stockholders in the next quarterly report along with a justification for such excess borrowing. Fair market value is based on the estimated market value of our real estate assets as of December 31, 2017 used to determine our estimated per share NAV as of such date, and for those assets acquired from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018, is based on the purchase price. Gross assets consist of total gross real estate assets net of gross intangible lease liabilities. As of December 31, 2018, our ratio of debt to total gross assets net of gross intangible lease liabilities was 50.3% (50.1% including adjustments to debt for cash and cash equivalents), and our ratio of debt to the fair market value of our gross assets was 46.5%.
CR IV Management uses its best efforts to obtain financing on the most favorable terms available to us. CR IV Management has substantial discretion with respect to the financing we obtain, subject to our borrowing policies, which have been approved by our Board. Lenders may have recourse to assets not securing the repayment of the indebtedness. CR IV Management may elect to refinance properties during the term of a loan, but we expect this would occur only in limited circumstances, such as when a decline in interest rates makes it beneficial to prepay an existing mortgage, when an existing mortgage matures or if an attractive asset becomes available and the proceeds from the refinancing can be used to purchase such asset. The benefits of the refinancing may include increased cash flow resulting from reduced debt service requirements and an increase in property ownership if some refinancing proceeds are reinvested in real estate. 
Our ability to increase our diversification through borrowing may be adversely impacted if banks and other lending institutions reduce the amount of funds available for loans secured by real estate. When interest rates on mortgage loans are high or financing is otherwise unavailable on a timely basis, we have purchased, and may continue to purchase, properties for cash with the intention of obtaining a mortgage loan for a portion of the purchase price at a later time. To the extent that we do not obtain mortgage loans on our properties, our ability to acquire additional properties will be restricted and we may not be able to adequately diversify our portfolio. Refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Associated with Debt Financing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
We may not borrow money from any of our directors, CCO Group, CR IV Management or any of their affiliates unless such loan is approved by a majority of the directors (including a majority of the independent directors) not otherwise interested in the transaction as fair, competitive and commercially reasonable and no less favorable to us than a comparable loan between unaffiliated parties. 
Disposition Policies
We generally intend to hold each property we acquire for an extended period, generally in excess of five years. Holding periods for other real estate-related assets may vary. Regardless of intended holding periods, circumstances might arise that could cause us to determine to sell an asset before the end of the expected holding period if we believe the sale of the asset would be in the best interests of our stockholders. The determination of whether a particular asset should be sold or otherwise disposed of will be made after consideration of relevant factors, including prevailing and projected economic conditions, current tenant rolls and tenant creditworthiness, whether we could apply the proceeds from the sale of the asset to acquire other 
13

assets, whether disposition of the asset would increase cash flow, and whether the sale of the asset would be a prohibited transaction under the Internal Revenue Code or otherwise impact our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. The selling price of a property that is net leased will be determined in large part by the amount of rent payable under the lease. If a tenant has a repurchase option at a formula price, we may be limited in realizing any appreciation. In connection with our sales of properties, we may lend the purchaser all or a portion of the purchase price. In these instances, our taxable income may exceed the cash received in the sale. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold 21 properties for an aggregate gross sales price of $66.6 million, resulting in net cash proceeds of $49.1 million and a gain of $6.3 million.
Acquisition of Properties from Affiliates of CR IV Management
We may acquire properties or interests in properties from, or in co-ownership arrangements with, entities affiliated with CR IV Management, including properties acquired from affiliates of CR IV Management engaged in construction and development of commercial real properties. We will not acquire any property from an affiliate of CR IV Management unless a majority of our directors (including a majority of our independent directors) not otherwise interested in the transaction determine that the transaction is fair and reasonable to us. The purchase price that we will pay for any property we acquire from affiliates of CR IV Management, including property developed by an affiliate of CR IV Management as well as property held by such an affiliate that has already been developed, will not exceed the current appraised value of the property. In addition, the price of the property we acquire from an affiliate of CR IV Management may not exceed the cost of the property to the affiliate, unless a majority of our directors (including a majority of our independent directors) determine that substantial justification for the excess exists and the excess is reasonable. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we did not purchase any properties from affiliates of our advisor. 
Conflicts of Interest
We are subject to various conflicts of interest arising out of our relationship with CR IV Management and its affiliates, including conflicts related to the arrangements pursuant to which we will compensate CR IV Management and its affiliates. Certain conflict resolution procedures are set forth in our charter. 
The officers and affiliates of CR IV Management will try to balance our interests with the interests of CIM and its affiliates and other programs sponsored or operated by CCO Group to whom they owe duties. However, to the extent that these persons take actions that are more favorable to other entities than to us, these actions could have a negative impact on our financial performance and, consequently, on distributions to our stockholders and the value of their investments. 
Our independent directors have an obligation to act on our behalf and on behalf of our stockholders in all situations in which a conflict of interest may arise.
As a result of the Services Agreement between VEREIT OP and CCO Group, until the end of the Initial Services Term, we are also subject to conflicts of interest arising out of our contractual relationship with VEREIT (NYSE: VER), the publicly-traded parent company of VEREIT OP, which also has investment objectives and targeted assets similar to ours. Conflicts of interest will also exist to the extent that we may acquire, or seek to acquire, properties in the same geographic areas where CIM or its affiliates own properties. In addition, our directors and our officers may engage for their own account in business activities of the types conducted or to be conducted by our subsidiaries and us.
Interests in Other Real Estate Programs and Other Concurrent Offerings
Richard S. Ressler, the chairman of our Board, chief executive officer and president, who is also a founder and principal of CIM and an officer/director of certain of its affiliates, is the chairman of the board, chief executive officer and president of CCIT III and CIM Income NAV, and a director of CCPT V and CCIT II. Avraham Shemesh, one of our directors, who is also a founder and principal of CIM and an officer/director of certain of its affiliates, serves as the chairman of the board, chief executive officer and president of CCIT II and CCPT V and as a director of CCIT III and CIM Income NAV. One of our independent directors, W. Brian Kretzmer, also serves as an independent director of CCIT III and CIM Income NAV. Nathan D. DeBacker, our chief financial officer and treasurer, is the chief financial officer and treasurer of CCIT II, CCIT III, CCPT V and CIM Income NAV, and also serves as an officer for various affiliates of CCO Group. In addition, affiliates of CR IV Management act as advisors to CCPT V, CCIT II, CCIT III and/or CIM Income NAV, all of which are public, non-listed REITs sponsored by our sponsor, CCO Group. In addition, all of these programs primarily focus on the acquisition and management of commercial properties subject to long-term net leases to creditworthy tenants and have acquired or may acquire assets similar to ours. CCPT V, like us, focuses primarily on the retail sector, while CCIT II and CCIT III focus primarily on the office and industrial sectors and CIM Income NAV focuses primarily on commercial properties in the retail, office and industrial sectors. Nevertheless, the investment strategy used by each REIT would permit them to purchase certain properties that may also be suitable for our portfolio.
14

CCIT II’s initial public offering of up to $2.975 billion in shares of common stock was declared effective by the SEC on September 17, 2013. CIM Income NAV’s offerings of up to $4.0 billion in shares of common stock were declared effective by the SEC on December 6, 2011, August 26, 2013 and February 10, 2017. CCPT V’s initial public offering of up to $2.975 billion in shares of common stock was declared effective by the SEC on March 17, 2014 and terminated on August 1, 2017. CCPT V’s follow-on offering of up to $1.5 billion in shares of common stock was declared effective by the SEC on August 1, 2017. CCIT III’s initial public offering of up to $3.5 billion in shares of common stock of two classes was declared effective by the SEC on September 22, 2016. CCIT II, CCPT V and CCIT III are no longer offering shares for investment to the public as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Other real estate programs sponsored or operated by CIM or CCO Group, including other real estate offerings in registration, could compete with us in the sale or operation of our assets. We will seek to achieve any operating efficiencies or similar savings that may result from affiliated management of competitive assets. However, to the extent such programs own or acquire property that is adjacent, or in close proximity, to a property we own, our property may compete with such other program’s property for tenants or purchasers. 
During the Initial Services Term of the Services Agreement, VEREIT OP is obligated to provide property acquisition services to us and CCO Group, and property acquisitions will be allocated among VEREIT and the real estate programs sponsored by CCO Group pursuant to an asset allocation policy and in accordance with the terms of the Services Agreement. During this period, in the event that an acquisition opportunity has been identified that may be suitable for more than one of us, VEREIT or one or more other programs sponsored by CCO Group, and for which more than one of such entities has sufficient funds, then an allocation committee, which is comprised of employees of VEREIT and employees of CIM, CCO Group or their respective affiliates (the “Allocation Committee”), will examine the following factors, among others, in determining the entity for which the acquisition opportunity is most appropriate:
•the investment objective of each entity;
•the anticipated operating cash flows of each entity and the cash requirements of each entity;

• | the effect of the acquisition both on diversification of each entity’s investments by type of property, geographic area and tenant concentration;

•the amount of funds available to each program and the length of time such funds have been available to deploy;
•the policy of each entity relating to leverage of properties;
•the income tax effects of the purchase to each entity; and
•the size of the investment.
If, in the judgment of the Allocation Committee, the acquisition opportunity may be equally appropriate for more than one program, then the entity that has had the longest period of time elapse since it was allocated an acquisition opportunity of a similar size and type (e.g., office, industrial or retail properties) will be allocated such acquisition opportunity. 
If a subsequent development, such as a delay in the closing of the acquisition or a delay in the construction of a property, causes any such acquisition opportunity, in the opinion of the Allocation Committee, to be more appropriate for an entity other than the entity that committed to make the acquisition opportunity, the Allocation Committee may determine that VEREIT or another program sponsored by CCO Group will be allocated the acquisition opportunity. The Board has a duty to ensure that the method used for the allocation of the acquisition of properties by VEREIT or by other programs sponsored by CCO Group seeking to acquire similar types of properties is applied fairly to us. 
On March 19, 2019, our Board approved amendments to the asset allocation policies to remove VEREIT as a participant under the policies. Pursuant to the amended asset allocation policies, effective April 1, 2019, the Allocation Committee will consist entirely of employees of CCO Group and its affiliates, and will allocate investment opportunities among us and other real estate programs sponsored by CCO Group by examining the same factors and applying the same process as described above. Accordingly, CCO Group and its affiliates may face similar conflicts of interest as those described above with respect to VEREIT OP during the Initial Services Term of the Services Agreement. 
Although our Board has adopted a policy limiting the types of transactions that we may enter into with CR IV Management and its affiliates, including other real estate programs sponsored by CCO Group, we may still enter into certain such transactions, which are subject to inherent conflicts of interest. Similarly, joint ventures involving affiliates of CR IV Management also give rise to conflicts of interest. In addition, our Board may encounter conflicts of interest in enforcing our rights against any affiliate of CR IV Management in the event of a default by or disagreement with an affiliate or in invoking powers, rights or options pursuant to any agreement between us and CR IV Management, any of its affiliates or another real estate program sponsored by CCO Group.
15

Other Activities of CR IV Management and Its Affiliates
We rely on our advisor, CR IV Management, for the day-to-day operation of our business. As a result of the interests of certain members of these entities’ management in CIM or its affiliates, or other real estate programs sponsored by CCO Group, and the fact that such persons also are engaged, and will continue to engage, in other business activities, CIM, our advisor and their respective officers, key persons and affiliates may have conflicts of interest in allocating their time and resources among us, CIM, their respective affiliates and other real estate programs sponsored by CCO Group, as applicable. However, our advisor believes that it, CIM and their respective affiliates, have sufficient personnel to discharge fully their responsibilities to all of the other programs sponsored or operated by CIM, CCO Group or their respective affiliates, and the other ventures in which they are involved. 
Richard S. Ressler, the chairman of our Board, chief executive officer, and president, who is also a founder and principal of CIM and an officer/director of certain of its affiliates, as well as the chairman of the board, chief executive officer and president of CCIT III and CIM Income NAV, and a director of CCPT V and CCIT II, is vice president of CR IV Management. Avraham Shemesh, one of our directors, who is also founder and principal of CIM and an officer/director of certain of its affiliates, and serves as a director of CCIT III and CIM Income NAV, as well as chairman of the board, chief executive officer and president of CCIT II and CCPT V, is president and treasurer of CR IV Management. In addition, our chief financial officer and treasurer, Nathan D. DeBacker, who is also an officer of other real estate programs sponsored by CCO Group, is vice president of CR IV Management. As a result, Messrs. Ressler and DeBacker may owe duties to these other entities and their stockholders or equity owners, as applicable, which may from time to time conflict with the duties that they owe to us and our stockholders.
Dealer Manager
Because CCO Capital, the dealer manager for the Offering, is an affiliate of CR IV Management, we did not have the benefit of an independent due diligence review and investigation of the type normally performed by an unaffiliated, independent underwriter in connection with the Offering.
Property Manager
Our properties are, and we anticipate that substantially all properties we acquire in the future will be, managed and leased by our property manager, CREI Advisors, an affiliate of our advisor, pursuant to property management and leasing agreements with our subsidiaries that hold title to our properties. We expect CREI Advisors to also serve as property manager for properties owned by other real estate programs sponsored by CCO Group, some of which may be in competition with our properties.
Receipt of Fees and Other Compensation by CR IV Management and Its Affiliates
We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, fees and expenses payable to CR IV Management and its affiliates in connection with the acquisition and management of our assets, including acquisition and advisory fees, acquisition expenses and operating expenses. 
A transaction involving the purchase or sale of properties, or the purchase or sale of any other real estate-related asset will likely result in the receipt of fees and other compensation by CR IV Management and its affiliates, including acquisition and advisory fees, disposition fees and the possibility of subordinated performance fees. Subject to oversight by our Board, CR IV Management will continue to have considerable discretion with respect to all decisions relating to the terms and timing of all transactions. Therefore, CR IV Management may have conflicts of interest concerning certain actions taken on our behalf, particularly due to the fact that acquisition fees will generally be based on the cost of the acquisition and payable to CR IV Management and its affiliates regardless of the quality of the properties acquired. The advisory fees are based on the estimated value of our assets which were acquired prior to the “as of” date of the most recent estimated per share NAV and are based on the costs of the assets acquired subsequent to the date of the most recent estimated per share NAV. Basing acquisition fees and advisory fees on the cost or estimated value of our assets may influence CR IV Management’s decisions relating to property acquisitions. 
Employees
We have no direct employees. The employees of CR IV Management and its affiliates provide services to us related to acquisitions and dispositions, property management, asset management, financing, accounting, stockholder relations and administration. The employees of CCO Capital, the dealer manager for the Offering, provided wholesale brokerage services during the Offering.
We are dependent on CR IV Management and its affiliates for services that are essential to us, including the sale of shares of our common stock, asset acquisition decisions, property management and other general administrative responsibilities. In the 
16

event that these companies are unable to provide these services to us, we would be required to obtain such services from other sources.
We reimburse CR IV Management and its affiliates for expenses incurred in connection with its provision of administrative, acquisition, property management, asset management, financing, accounting and stockholder relations services, including personnel costs, subject to certain limitations. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, $11.2 million, $10.0 million and $9.7 million, respectively, were recorded for reimbursement of services provided by CR IV Management and its affiliates in connection with the acquisition, management, operating and financing of our assets. No amounts were recorded for the reimbursement of certain third-party and personnel costs allocated in connection with the issuance of shares pursuant to the Offering during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.
Competition
As we purchase properties, we are in competition with other potential buyers for the same properties and may have to pay more to purchase the property than if there were no other potential acquirers or we may have to locate another property that meets our acquisition criteria. Regarding the leasing efforts of our owned properties, the leasing of real estate is highly competitive in the current market, and we may continue to experience competition for tenants from owners and managers of competing projects. As a result, we may have to provide free rent, incur charges for tenant improvements, or offer other inducements, or we might not be able to timely lease the space, all of which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations. At the time we elect to dispose of our properties, we may also be in competition with sellers of similar properties to locate suitable purchasers for our properties. See the section captioned “— Conflicts of Interest” above.
Property Concentrations
As of December 31, 2018, no single tenant or geographic location accounted for greater than 10% of our 2018 annualized rental income. As of December 31, 2018, we have certain industry concentrations in our property holdings. In particular, we have tenants in the discount store and pharmacy industries, which comprised 15% and 10%, respectively, of our 2018 annualized rental income. See Part I, Item 2. Properties of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the geographic concentration of our properties. 
Environmental Matters
All real property and the operations conducted on real property are subject to federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety. These laws and regulations generally govern wastewater discharges, air emissions, the operation and removal of underground and above-ground storage tanks, the use, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous materials, the presence and release of hazardous substances and the remediation of any associated contamination. Federal, state and local laws in this area are constantly evolving, and we intend to take commercially reasonable steps to protect ourselves from the impact of these laws. We carry environmental liability insurance on our properties that will provide limited coverage for remediation liability and/or pollution liability for third-party bodily injury and/or property damage claims for which we may be liable.
We generally will not purchase any property unless and until we also obtain what is generally referred to as a “Phase I” environmental site assessment and are generally satisfied with the environmental status of the property. However, we may purchase a property without obtaining such assessment if our advisor determines the assessment is not necessary because there exists a recent Phase I environmental site assessment that we deem satisfactory. A Phase I environmental site assessment generally consists of a visual survey of the building and the property in an attempt to identify areas of potential environmental concerns, visually observing neighboring properties to assess surface conditions or activities that may have an adverse environmental impact on the property, interviewing the key site manager and/or property owner, contacting local governmental agency personnel and performing an environmental regulatory database search in an attempt to determine any known environmental concerns in, and in the immediate vicinity of, the property. A Phase I environmental site assessment does not generally include any sampling or testing of soil, ground water or building materials from the property and may not reveal all environmental hazards on a property.
In the event the Phase I environmental site assessment uncovers potential environmental problems with a property, our advisor will determine whether we will pursue the acquisition opportunity and whether we will have a “Phase II” environmental site assessment performed. The factors we may consider in determining whether to conduct a Phase II environmental site assessment include, but are not limited to, (1) the types of operations conducted on the property and surrounding properties, (2) the time, duration and materials used during such operations, (3) the waste handling practices of any tenants or property owners, (4) the potential for hazardous substances to be released into the environment, (5) any history of environmental law violations on the subject property and surrounding properties, (6) any documented environmental releases, (7) any observations from the consultant that conducted the Phase I environmental site assessment, and (8) whether any party 
17

(e.g., surrounding property owners, prior owners or tenants) may be responsible for addressing the environmental conditions. We will determine whether to conduct a Phase II environmental site assessment on a case by case basis.
We have acquired and we expect that some of the properties that we acquire in the future may contain, at the time of our acquisition, or may have contained prior to our acquisition, storage tanks for the storage of petroleum products and other hazardous or toxic substances. All of these operations create a potential for the release of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. Some of the properties that we acquire may be adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or contain storage tanks used to store petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, certain of the properties that we acquire may be on, or adjacent to or near other properties upon which others, including former owners or tenants of our properties, have engaged, or may in the future engage, in activities that may release petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances.
From time to time, we may acquire properties, or interests in properties, with known adverse environmental conditions where we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are significant and quantifiable but that the acquisition will yield a superior risk-adjusted return. In such an instance, we will estimate the costs of environmental investigation, clean-up and monitoring in determining the purchase price. Further, in connection with property dispositions, we may agree to remain responsible for, and to bear the cost of, remediating or monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties.
We are not aware of any environmental matters which we believe are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
