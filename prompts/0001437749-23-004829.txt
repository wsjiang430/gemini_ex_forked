ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 
Unless otherwise required by the context, the terms “we”, “us”, “our” and “the company” as used herein refer to Tidewater Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries and predecessors.
 
About Tidewater
 
We were incorporated in 1956 and for over 65 years, we have provided marine and transportation services to the global offshore energy industry. Our mission includes providing our services to our customers with the highest level of operational performance, while complying with all laws and regulations, respecting the environment and local communities in which we work and ensuring the safety of our people.
 
We offer a large and diversified fleet of offshore service vessels (OSV or vessels), with 183 active vessels serving customers in over 30 countries as of December 31, 2022. We believe our global operating footprint allows us to react quickly to changing local market conditions and to be responsive to the changing requirements of our customers, with which we believe we have strong relationships. We manage our operations through the following five geographically aligned reporting segments:
 

● | Americas 
--+---------------------
● | Asia Pacific 
● | Middle East 
● | Europe/Mediterranean
● | West Africa 

 
Each reporting segment is managed by a senior executive who reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer, the chief operating decision maker.
 
Our vessels routinely move between geographic regions. We conduct our business through domestic and international subsidiaries, as well as through joint ventures that we may or may not control (generally where required to satisfy local ownership or local content requirements).
 
Our vessels and associated services support all phases of offshore crude oil and natural gas (also referred to as oil and gas) exploration, field development and production, as well as windfarm development and maintenance. Our services include towing of, and anchor handling for, mobile offshore drilling units; transporting supplies and personnel necessary to sustain drilling, workover and production activities; offshore construction and seismic and subsea support; geotechnical survey support for windfarm construction, and a variety of other specialized services such as pipe and cable laying.
 
Our active OSV fleet consists primarily of company owned vessels. As of December 31, 2022, we owned 183 active vessels of which five have been temporarily stacked or withdrawn from service. In addition, we owned eight vessels classified as assets held for sale in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Please refer to Note (1) - “Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and Note (8) - “Assets Held For Sale, Asset Sales and Asset Impairments” to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” (Consolidated Financial Statements) in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (Form 10-K) for additional information regarding our stacked vessels and vessels held for sale.
 
Our principal customers include large, international integrated and independent oil and natural gas exploration, field development and production companies (IOCs); mid-sized and smaller independent exploration and production (E&P) companies; foreign government-owned or government-controlled organizations that explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas (NOCs); offshore drilling contractors; and other companies that provide various services to the offshore energy industry, including, among other things, offshore construction companies, windfarm development companies, diving companies and well stimulation companies.

Our revenues, net earnings and cash flows from operations are largely dependent upon the activity level of our offshore marine vessel fleet. As is the case with the numerous other vessel operators in our industry, our business activity is largely dependent on the level of exploration, field development and production activity of our customers. Our customers’ business activity, in turn, is largely dependent on current and expected crude oil and natural gas prices, which fluctuate depending on expected future levels of supply and demand for crude oil and natural gas, and on estimates of the cost to find, develop and produce crude oil and natural gas reserves.
 
Depending on vessel capabilities and availability, our vessels operate in the shallow, intermediate and deepwater offshore markets. Deepwater oil and gas development typically involves significant capital investment and multi-year development plans. Although these projects are generally less susceptible to short-term fluctuations in commodity prices, deepwater exploration and development projects are generally more costly than other onshore and offshore exploration and development. We expect offshore windfarm developments to increase over the coming years, and believe these developments may provide additional opportunities for a certain cross-section of our larger vessels. These projects generally require fewer but more highly specialized vessels.
 
Revenues are derived primarily from vessel time charter or similar contracts ranging in duration from a few months to several years, and to a lesser extent, from vessel time charter contracts on a “spot” basis, which are short-term agreements ranging from one day to several months where we provide offshore marine services to customers for specific short-term jobs. The base rate of hire for a term contract is generally a fixed rate, though some charter arrangements allow us to recover specific additional costs.
 
Acquisition of Swire Pacific Offshore Holdings Limited
 
On April 22, 2022, Tidewater acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Swire Pacific Offshore Holdings Limited (SPO), pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement with Banyan Overseas Limited (Banyan) for a total consideration of $215.5 million, consisting of (i) $61.6 million in cash paid at closing less a subsequent receipt of an $8.8 million post-closing working capital refund; and (ii) 8,100,000 warrants, exercisable at $0.001 per share for one share of our common stock (SPO Acquisition Warrants). As of closing, SPO and its wholly owned subsidiaries owned 50 offshore support vessels operating primarily in West Africa, Southeast Asia and the Middle East.
 
On June 24, 2022, we amended the Share Purchase Agreement (SPA Amendment) to allow Banyan to surrender SPO Acquisition Warrants to satisfy any indemnity liabilities. Under the indemnification provisions of the Share Purchase Agreement (SPA) and the SPA Amendment, Banyan requested that we allow them to settle approximately $1.4 million in indemnified liabilities by surrendering the equivalent value in SPO Acquisition Warrants. We granted Banyan’s request, and during 2022, settled the agreed upon indemnification liability in exchange for the surrender of 64,086 SPO Acquisition Warrants that we subsequently cancelled.
 
During the second half of 2022, we completed two common stock public offerings to facilitate the redemption of the SPO Acquisition Warrants, including an offering for 4,048,000 shares at $17.85 per share completed on August 12, 2022, and an offering for 3,987,914 shares at $30.25 per share completed on November 10, 2022 (the Offerings). The Offerings resulted in net proceeds (after expenses) of approximately $187.8 million that we used to redeem 8,035,914 SPO Acquisition Warrants, which we subsequently cancelled. As a result, no SPO Acquisition Warrants remained outstanding as of December 31, 2022.
 
Vessel Classifications
 
Our primary vessel classifications include Anchor Handling Towing Supply Vessels (AHTS) and Platform Supply Vessels (PSVs). A description of the type of vessels categorized in each vessel class and the services typically performed follows.
Anchor Handling Towing Supply Vessels
 
The most versatile vessels in the Tidewater fleet are large, powerful AHTS vessels, capable of all types of towing, anchor handling activities, and varied subsea operations. Fitted with experienced crews and state of the art technology, AHTS vessels of various classes are capable of positioning and mooring drilling rigs in virtually any location, depth or sea condition and under a wide range of conditions. With a wide range of power, sizes and capacities, these vessels are also well-suited for general offshore support services, drilling rig support functions and cargo transport assignments.
 
    5 

  


As of December 31, 2022, we operated 57 AHTS vessels throughout our service regions.
 

● | Small AHTS class. Generally, this vessel class includes AHTS vessels that have up to 8,000 brake horsepower (BHP). These vessels typically work in shallow waters along the coast or on the continental shelf. As of December 31, 2022, we operated 25 small AHTS vessels.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Medium AHTS class. Generally, this vessel class includes AHTS vessels that have between 8,000 and 16,000 BHP. These vessels can work in shallow waters along the coast or on the continental shelf or in intermediate depths offshore. As of December 31, 2022, we operated 21 medium AHTS vessels.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Large AHTS class. Generally, this vessel class includes AHTS vessels with over 16,000 BHP. These vessels primarily work in deepwater. Large AHTS vessels are equipped to tow drilling rigs and other marine equipment, as well as to set anchors for the positioning and mooring of drilling rigs that generally do not have dynamic positioning capabilities. As of December 31, 2022, we operated 11 large AHTS vessels.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Platform Supply Vessels (PSV)
 
PSVs generally have cargo carrying capacities, both below deck (liquid mud tanks and dry bulk tanks) and above deck. Most of our PSVs are outfitted with dynamic positioning capabilities, which allow the vessels to maintain an absolute or relative position when mooring to an offshore installation, rig or another vessel is deemed unsafe, impractical or undesirable. Many of our PSVs also have oil recovery, firefighting, standby rescue and/or other specialized equipment. As of December 31, 2022, we operated 104 PSVs throughout our service regions.

● | Large PSVs. Generally, this vessel class includes PSVs that have greater than 900 square meters of deck space. As of December 31, 2022, we operated 43 large PSVs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Medium PSVs. Generally, this vessel class includes PSVs that have between 500 and 900 square meters of deck space. As of December 31, 2022, we operated 61 medium PSVs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other Vessels
 
Our other vessels class includes crew boats, utility vessels and offshore tugs. Crew boats and utility vessels are chartered to customers for use in transporting personnel and supplies from shore bases to offshore drilling rigs, platforms and other installations. These vessels are also often equipped for oil field security missions in markets where piracy, kidnapping or other potential violence presents a concern. Offshore tugs are used to tow floating drilling rigs and barges; to assist in the docking of tankers; and to assist pipe laying, cable laying and construction barges. As of December 31, 2022, we operated 22 vessels classified as other.
 
In addition, we have two offshore tugs and two crew boats under construction for use in our African markets. We expect the tugs to be completed in 2023 and the crew boats to be completed in 2024.
 
Customers and Contracting 
 
Demand for our services depends substantially on our customers’ strategy and allocation of capital spending related to offshore exploration, development and production of oil and gas reserves. These expenditures are generally dependent on our customers’ views of future demand for oil and gas and future oil and gas prices, as well as our customers’ ability to access capital. The activity levels of our customers also are influenced by the cost (and relative cost) of exploring for and producing oil and gas offshore, which can be affected by environmental regulations, technological advances that affect energy production and consumption, extreme weather conditions, and local and international economic and political environments, including government mandated moratoriums. Although commodity prices have recovered from historic lows seen in 2020, our customers have generally lowered their capital expenditure programs considering market volatility and competing priorities, including returning capital to shareholders and investing in alternative energy sources. In addition, we derive a significant amount of revenue from a relatively small number of customers. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our five largest customers accounted for approximately 35.8%, while our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 51.2% of our total revenues.
 
    6 

  


The following table discloses our customers that accounted for 10% or more of total revenues:
 

 | Years Ended | 
--------------------+--------------+-----
 | December 31, | | | December 31, | | December 31,
 | 2022 | | | 2021 | | 2020 
Chevron Corporation | | 12.3 | % | | 15.7 | % | 14.3 | %
Saudi Aramco | | * | | | 11.8 | % | 11.5 | %

 
* Less than 10% of total revenues.
 
While it is normal for our customer base to change over time as our vessel time charter contracts turn over, the unexpected loss of any of our significant customers could, at least in the short term, have a material adverse effect on our vessel utilization and our results of operations.
 
Competition 
 
We have numerous competitors of all sizes. The principal competitive factors for the offshore support vessel service industry are the quality, suitability and technical capabilities of vessels, the availability of vessels and related equipment, the price and quality of service, and the legal ability to provide the service in the applicable region. In addition, the ability to demonstrate a strong record for safety and efficiency, and attract and retain qualified and skilled personnel, are important competitive factors. We have numerous competitors in all areas in which we operate, and our ability to compete in the international markets may be adversely affected by regulations requiring, among other things, local construction, flagging, ownership or control of vessels, the awarding of contracts to local contractors, the employment of local citizens and/or the purchase of supplies from local vendors.
 
Our diverse, mobile asset base and the wide geographic distribution of our assets generally enable us to respond relatively quickly to changes in market conditions and to provide a broad range of vessel services to customers around the world. We believe that the size, age, diversity and geographic distribution of a vessel operator’s fleet, economies of scale and experience level in the many areas of the world are competitive advantages in our industry. In the Americas region, we benefit from cabotage which includes rules and restrictions promulgated thereunder by the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 and the Shipping Act, 1916, as amended (collectively, the Jones Act), which limit vessels that can operate in the GOM and other offshore regions within U.S. territorial waters, to those owned by companies that qualify as U.S. citizens. Also, in certain foreign countries, preferences given to vessels owned by local companies may be mandated by local law or by national oil companies. We have attempted to mitigate such preferences through affiliations with local companies.
 
International Labour Organization’s Maritime Labour Convention
 
The International Labour Organization's Maritime Labour Convention, 2006 (the MLC) mandates globally, among other things, seafarer living and working conditions (accommodations, wages, conditions of employment, health and other benefits) aboard ships that are engaged in commercial activities. Since its initial entry into force on August 20, 2013, 90 countries have ratified the MLC.
 
We maintain certification of our vessels to MLC requirements, perform maintenance and repairs at shipyards, and make port calls during ocean voyages in accordance with the MLC based on the dates of enforcement by countries in which we operate. In addition, where possible, we continue to work with identified flag states to seek substantial equivalencies to comparable national and industry laws that meet the intent of the MLC and allow us to standardize operational protocols among our fleet.
 
Government Regulation 
 
We are subject to various United States (U.S.) federal, state and local statutes and regulations governing the ownership, operation and maintenance of vessels. Our U.S. flagged vessels are subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the U.S. Maritime Administration. We also are subject to international laws and conventions and the laws of international jurisdictions where we operate.
 
    7 

  


Under the citizenship provisions of the Jones Act, we would not be permitted to engage in the U.S. coastwise trade if more than 25% of our outstanding shares of common stock are owned by non-U.S. Citizens (as defined by the Jones Act). For a company engaged in the U.S. coastwise trade to be deemed a U.S. citizen: (i) it must be organized under the laws of the United States or of a state, territory or possession thereof, (ii) each of the chief executive officer and the chairman of the board of directors of such corporation must be a U.S. citizen, (iii) no more than a minority of the number of directors of such corporation necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business can be non-U.S. Citizens and (iv) at least 75% of the interest in such corporation must be owned by U.S. citizens. We have a dual stock certificate system to protect against non-U.S. Citizens owning more than 25% of our common stock. In addition, our certificate of incorporation (as amended) provides us with certain remedies with respect to any transfer or purported transfer of shares of our common stock that would result in the ownership by non-U.S. Citizens of more than 24% of our common stock. Based on the latest information available to us, less than 24% of our outstanding common stock was owned by non-U.S. Citizens as of December 31, 2022.
 
Our vessel operations in the GOM are considered coastwise trade. U.S. law requires that vessels engaged in the U.S. coastwise trade must be built in the U.S. and registered under U.S. flag. In addition, once a U.S. built vessel is registered under a non-U.S. flag, it cannot thereafter engage in U.S. coastwise trade. Therefore, our non-U.S. flagged vessels must operate outside of the U.S. coastwise trade zone. Of the total 191 vessels (which includes eight vessels held for sale) that we owned or operated at December 31, 2022, 180 vessels were registered under flags other than the United States and 11 were registered under the U.S. flag.
 
All our offshore vessels are subject to either United States or international safety and classification standards or sometimes both. Our U.S. flagged AHTS vessels, PSVs and other vessels are required to undergo periodic inspections generally twice within every five-year period pursuant to U.S. Coast Guard regulations. Vessels registered under flags other than the United States are subject to similar regulations and are governed by the laws of the applicable international jurisdictions and the rules and requirements of various classification societies, such as the American Bureau of Shipping.
 
We comply with the International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code, an amendment to the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Convention (1974/1988), and further mandated in the Maritime Transportation and Security Act of 2002 to align United States regulations with those of the ISPS Code and SOLAS. Under the ISPS Code, we perform worldwide security assessments, risk analyses, and develop vessel and required port facility security plans to enhance safe and secure vessel and facility operations. Additionally, we have developed security annexes for those U.S. flag vessels that transit or work in waters designated as high risk by the U.S. Coast Guard pursuant to the latest revision of Maritime Security Directive 104-6.
 
Occupational Safety and Health Compliance 
 
In the U.S., we are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and other similar laws and regulations, which establish workplace standards for the protection of the health and safety of employees, including the implementation of hazard communications programs designed to inform employees about hazardous substances in the workplace, potential harmful effects of these substances, and appropriate control measures.
 
As described above, certain of the international jurisdictions in which we operate have ratified the MLC, which establishes minimum requirements for working conditions of seafarers, including conditions of employment, hours of work and rest, grievance and complaints procedures, accommodations, recreational facilities, food and catering, health protection, medical care, welfare and social security protection. Although the U.S. is not a party to the MLC, U.S. flag vessels operating internationally must comply with the MLC when calling on a port in a country that is a party to the MLC.
 
Environmental Compliance 
 
During the ordinary course of business, our operations are subject to a wide variety of environmental laws and regulations that govern the discharge of oil, oil products and other pollutants into navigable waters. Violations of these laws may result in civil and criminal penalties, fines, injunctions and other sanctions. Compliance with the existing governmental regulations that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment has not had, nor is expected to have, a material effect on us. Environmental laws and regulations are subject to change, however, and may impose increasingly strict requirements, and, as such, we cannot estimate the ultimate cost of complying with such potential changes to environmental laws and regulations. In addition, a wide range of governmental regulatory agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Office of Pipeline Safety, the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement and certain individual states, regulate vessels and other structures in accordance with the requirements of federal and state law.
 
    8 

  


Little uniformity among the regulations issued by these agencies exists at this time, which increases our compliance costs and risk of non-compliance. Existing U.S. environmental laws and regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to:
 

● | the Clean Air Act, which restricts the emission of air pollutants from many sources and imposes various preconstruction, operational, monitoring and reporting requirements, and that the EPA has relied upon as the authority for adopting climate change regulatory initiatives relating to greenhouse gas emissions;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the Clean Water Act, which regulates discharges of pollutants from facilities to state and federal waters and establishes the extent to which waterways are subject to federal jurisdiction and rulemaking as protected waters of the U.S.;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which subjects owners and operators of vessels, onshore facilities, and pipelines, as well as lessees or permittees of areas in which offshore facilities are located, to liability for removal costs and damages arising from an oil spill in waters of the United States;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, which imposes liability on generators, transporters, and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which govern crude oil and natural gas operations on federal lands and waters and impose obligations for establishing financial assurances for decommissioning activities, liabilities for pollution cleanup costs resulting from operations, and potential liabilities for pollution damages.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In the U.S. and abroad, we are subject to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL), an international convention that imposes environmental standards on the shipping industry relating to oil spills, management of garbage, the handling of certain substances, sewage and air emissions. Annex VI of MARPOL addresses air emissions, including emissions of sulfur and nitrous oxide, and requires the use of low sulfur fuels worldwide in both auxiliary and main propulsion diesel engines on vessels. The International Maritime Organization designates the waters off North America as an Emission Control Area, meaning that vessels operating in the U.S. must use fuel with a sulfur content no greater than 0.1%. Directives have been issued designed to reduce the emission of nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides. These can impact both the fuel and the engines that may be used onboard vessels. For further discussion of regulatory risks related to climate change see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of this Form 10-K.
 
We are also involved in various legal proceedings that relate to other environmental matters. The amount of ultimate liability, if any, with respect to these proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. We are proactive in establishing policies and operating procedures for safeguarding the environment against any hazardous materials aboard our vessels and at shore-based locations. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 also requires owners and operators of vessels over 300 gross tons to provide the USCG with evidence of financial responsibility to cover the cost of cleaning up oil spills from those vessels. Several foreign jurisdictions also require us to present satisfactory evidence of financial responsibility. We satisfy these requirements through appropriate insurance coverage, as discussed below in “Risk Management.”
 
Moreover, environmental laws and regulations also can affect the resale value or significantly reduce the useful lives of our vessels, require a reduction in carrying capacity, ship modifications or operational changes or restrictions (and related increased operating costs) or retirement of service, lead to decreased availability or higher cost of insurance coverage for environmental matters or result in the denial of access to, or detention in, certain jurisdictional waters or ports. Whenever possible, hazardous materials are maintained or transferred in confined areas to ensure containment, if accidents were to occur. In addition, we have established operating policies that are intended to increase awareness of actions that may harm the environment, including being committed to responsible ship recycling in accordance with the Hong Kong convention and European Ship Recycling Regulation.
 
In addition to governmental regulation, large oil and gas producers have developed strict due diligence processes for selecting their suppliers out of concerns for the environmental impact of their operations. Our failure to maintain any of our vessels to the standards required by the industry could put us in breach of the applicable charter agreement and lead to termination of such agreement. Should we not be able to successfully clear such risk assessment processes on an ongoing basis, the future employment of our vessels could also be adversely affected since it might lead to the termination of existing charters.

Safety 
 
We are dedicated to ensuring the safety of our operations for our employees, our customers and any personnel associated with our operations. Tidewater’s principal operations occur in offshore waters where the workplace environment presents many safety challenges. Management communicates frequently with company personnel to promote safety and instill safe work habits using company media directed at, and regular training of, both our seamen and shore-based personnel. We dedicate personnel and resources to ensure safe operations and regulatory compliance. Our Director of Health, Safety, Environment and Security (HSE) Management is involved in numerous proactive efforts to prevent accidents and injuries from occurring. The HSE Director also reviews all incidents that occur, focusing on lessons that can be learned from such incidents and opportunities to incorporate such lessons into our on-going safety-related training. In addition, we employ safety personnel to be responsible for administering our safety programs and fostering our safety culture. Our position is that each of our employees is a safety supervisor with the authority and the obligation to stop any operation that they deem to be unsafe.
Risk Management 
 
The operation of any marine vessel involves an inherent risk of marine losses (including physical damage to the vessel) attributable to adverse sea and weather conditions, mechanical failure, and collisions. In addition, the nature of our operations exposes us to the potential risks of damage to and loss of drilling rigs and production facilities, hostile activities attributable to war, sabotage, piracy and terrorism, as well as business interruption due to political action or inaction, including nationalization of assets by foreign governments. Any such event may lead to a reduction in revenues or increased costs. Our vessels are generally insured for their estimated market value against damage or loss, including war, acts of terrorism, and pollution risks, but we do not directly or fully insure for business interruption. We also carry workers’ compensation, maritime employer’s liability, director and officer liability, general liability (including third party pollution) and other insurance customary in the industry.
 
The continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war or hostility have significantly increased the risk of political, economic and social instability in some of the geographic areas in which we operate. Further acts of terrorism may be directed against the U.S. domestically or abroad, and such acts of terrorism could be directed against properties and personnel of U.S. headquartered companies such as ours. The resulting economic, political and social uncertainties, including the potential for future terrorist acts and war, could cause the premiums charged for the insurance coverage to increase. We currently maintain war risk coverage on our entire fleet.
 
We seek to secure appropriate insurance coverage at competitive rates. We carefully monitor claims and actively participate in claims estimates and adjustments. We believe that our insurance coverage is adequate. We have not experienced a loss in excess of insurance policy limits; however, there is no assurance that our liability coverage will be adequate to cover claims that may arise. While we believe that we should be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates considered commercially acceptable, we cannot guarantee that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially acceptable rates given the markets in which we operate. For further discussion of our risks see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
 
Environmental, Social and Governance
 
We are committed to transparently reporting on environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors that may be relevant to us. Our Board of Directors (the Board) engages in regular discussions relating to environmental matters and our response to ESG-related risks and opportunities, as further described below.
Environment
 
Energy Transition
 
Climate change concerns have precipitated a call from governments and other entities to transition from fossil fuels for energy production and power transportation. The primary offender in climate change is considered to be carbon emissions. The recent goal of the advocates of the energy transition is to reduce world-wide carbon emissions to net zero by the year 2050. The preferred energy sources that produce no carbon emissions are wind, solar and nuclear. Our Sustainability Report addresses our progress toward attaining lower carbon emissions and supporting more environmentally friendly energy sources. We believe that our long-term success depends on our ability to effectively navigate the energy transition and we believe we will have opportunities to participate in that transition while also supporting the fossil fuel industry. We currently have a few vessels supporting the wind farm business. We also expect to have significant opportunities from the offshore oil and gas industry as they dismantle their massive offshore production infrastructure during the transition. We believe that the fossil fuel industry will continue to provide fuel for energy throughout the transition and we are prepared to provide support through the process.
 
    10 

  


Seasonality 
 
Our global vessel fleet generally has its highest utilization rates in the warmer months when the weather is more favorable for offshore exploration, field development and construction work in the oil and gas industry. Hurricanes, cyclones, the monsoon season, and other severe weather can negatively or positively impact vessel operations. Our GOM operations can be impacted by the Atlantic hurricane season from the months of June through November, when offshore exploration, field development and construction work tend to slow or halt to mitigate potential losses and damage that may occur to the offshore oil and gas infrastructure should a hurricane enter the area. However, demand for offshore marine vessels typically increases in the GOM in connection with repair and remediation work that follows any hurricane damage to offshore oil and gas infrastructure. Our vessels that operate offshore in India, other areas in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific are impacted by the monsoon season, which occurs across the region from November to April. Vessels that operate in the North Sea can be impacted by a seasonal slowdown in the winter months, generally from November to March. Although hurricanes, cyclones, monsoons and other severe weather can have a seasonal impact on operations, our business volume is more dependent on oil and gas pricing, global supply of oil and gas, and demand for our offshore support vessels and other services than on any seasonal variation.
Social and Human Capital Management
 
Employees and Labor Relations
 
As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 6,300 employees worldwide with over 90% of our fleet operating internationally in more than 30 countries. We are not a party to any union contract in the U.S. but through several subsidiaries, we are subject to union agreements covering local nationals in several countries other than the U.S., most heavily in the North Sea with UK and Norwegian mariners.
Culture and Engagement
 
Our employees and our culture are critical to our long-term success. Our senior leadership team believes in and promotes Tidewater’s culture through our “7 Cs”:
 

● | Capability 
--+--------------
● | Collaboration
● | Commitment 
● | Communication
● | Compassion 
● | Compliance 
● | Courage 

 
We focus on creating an environment where our colleagues feel respected, valued, and can contribute to their fullest potential. We leverage technology to promote online collaborative workspaces to bring our colleagues together across multiple time zones and geographies and to create a global sense of community.
 
Health and Safety
 
We maintain a safety culture grounded on the premise of eliminating workplace incidents, risks and hazards. We are dedicated to ensuring the safety of our employees, our customers and any personnel associated with our operations. Our principal operations occur in offshore waters where the workplace environment presents many safety challenges. Management communicates frequently with company personnel to promote safety and instill safe work habits using company media directed at, and regular training of, both our mariners and shore-based personnel. We dedicate personnel and resources to ensure safe operations and regulatory compliance. In addition, we employ safety personnel who are responsible for administering our safety programs and fostering our safety culture and monitoring the results of our safety programs and initiatives. We expect each of our employees to be a "safety supervisor" with the authority and the obligation to stop any operation that they deem to be unsafe.
 
    11 

  

By establishing practical safeguards against identified risks, we take a consistent and proactive approach to minimizing the number of accidents, incidents and hazardous occurrences. We use both leading and lagging indicators to monitor the performance of our health and safety programs. Lagging indicators include the Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) and the Lost Time Incident Rate (LTIR) based upon the number of incidents per one million working hours. Leading indicators include reporting and closure of all near-miss events and Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) training activities. For 2022, we had a TRIR of 0.79, a LTIR of 0.14 and no work-related fatalities.
 
In 2022, we continued certain additional safety protocols and operational measures to address the challenges resulting from COVID-19, including measures to ensure compliance with any applicable local government requirements, customer restrictions or regulatory guidelines to help mitigate the risk of operational interruptions and maintain the health and safety of our employees, contractors and customers.
 
Inclusion and Diversity
 
We embrace the diversity of our team members, stakeholders and customers, including their unique backgrounds, experiences, thoughts and talents. Everyone is valued and appreciated for their distinct contributions to the growth and sustainability of our business. We strive to cultivate a culture and vision that supports and enhances our ability to recruit, develop and retain diverse talent at every level. We are an equal opportunity employer, with all qualified applicants receiving consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability or protected veteran status. We comply with all applicable employment, labor and immigration requirements, and require our personnel to cooperate with all compliance efforts. We have a policy of continuous improvement; opportunities to further connect and support collaboration between our diverse employee base continue to be identified and addressed with further investments in training, tools and systems.
 
We are committed to racial equality and fostering a culture of diversity and inclusion throughout our organization, a commitment that both starts with, and is reflected in, our board of directors. We have made diversity and inclusion an important part of our hiring and retention efforts. Our chief operating officer, who also serves as our chief human resource officer (CHRO), has primary responsibility for our human capital management strategy, including attracting, developing, engaging and retaining those talented employees. The CHRO is also responsible for the design of employee compensation and benefits programs in addition to promoting diversity and inclusion throughout the company.
 
Governance
 
Our Board believes the purpose of corporate governance is to maximize stockholder value in a manner consistent with legal requirements and the highest standards of integrity. The Board has adopted and adheres to corporate governance practices, which the Board and management believe promote this purpose, are sound, and represent best practices. The Board periodically reviews these governance practices, applicable law, the rules and listing standards of the NYSE and SEC regulations, as well as best practices suggested by recognized governance authorities.
 
We are committed to transparently reporting on ESG factors that may be relevant to us. We use internationally recognized methods and reporting standards to measure and disclose our performance in relation to ESG factors. In April 2021, we published our inaugural sustainability report (Sustainability Report) for the year ended December 31, 2020, which included disclosures in accordance with the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) reporting standards, and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Marine Transportation standards. We published our 2021 Sustainability Report in accordance with these same standards in April of 2022.
 
Given the increased importance and focus on ESG factors by our stakeholders, our Board formed a separate ESG Committee in 2022 to oversee our sustainability efforts and reporting. Our Board, along with the ESG Committee, monitors and provides oversight over our ESG policies, programs, and practices regarding corporate responsibility and sustainability and plays an active role in overseeing our human capital management efforts. Our Compensation Committee provides oversight of our social strategy, executive compensation and benefits, policies, programs, and initiatives. Our Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee provides oversight of the Company's governance and corresponding regulatory matters. The Audit Committee provides oversight over our environmental and governmental matters, including risk assessment and risk management policies and processes, including data privacy, ethics, and compliance reporting.
 
For further discussion of ESG risks and considerations see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of this Form 10-K.

Reporting Segments
 
Prior to 2022, we managed our business through four segments including the Americas, Middle East/Asia Pacific, Europe/Mediterranean, and West Africa. In connection with the acquisition of SPO, we split our Middle East/Asia Pacific segment into an Asia Pacific segment and a Middle East segment, resulting in the five segments. Our reporting segments and corresponding disclosures have been adjusted to reflect each of the five segments for all periods presented.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
 
Certain of the statements included in this Form 10-K constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which includes any statements that are not historical facts. Such statements often contain words such as “expect,” “believe,” “think,” “anticipate,” “predict,” “plan,” “assume,” “estimate,” “forecast,” “goal,” “target,” “projections,” “intend,” “should,” “will,” “shall” and other similar words. Forward-looking statements are made based on management’s current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects upon Tidewater Inc. and its subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting Tidewater Inc. and its subsidiaries will be those anticipated by management. These forward-looking statements are not a guarantee of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties, and there are certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ, possibly materially, from expectations or estimates reflected in such forward-looking statements, including, among others: fluctuations in worldwide energy demand and oil and natural gas prices; industry overcapacity; limited capital resources available to replenish our asset base as needed, including through acquisitions or vessel construction, and to fund our capital expenditure needs; uncertainty of global financial market conditions and potential constraints in accessing capital or credit if and when needed with favorable terms, if at all; changes in decisions and capital spending by customers in the energy industry and the industry expectations for offshore exploration, field development and production; consolidation of our customer base; loss of a major customer; changing customer demands for vessel specifications, which may make some of our older vessels technologically obsolete for certain customer projects or in certain markets; rapid technological changes; delays and other problems associated with vessel maintenance; the continued availability of qualified personnel and our ability to attract and retain them; the operating risks normally incident to our lines of business, including the potential impact of liquidated counterparties; our ability to comply with covenants in our indentures and other debt instruments; acts of terrorism and piracy; the impact of regional or global public health crises or pandemics; the impact of potential information technology, cybersecurity or data security breaches; integration of acquired businesses and entry into new lines of business; disagreements with our joint venture partners; natural disasters or significant weather conditions; unsettled political conditions, war, civil unrest and governmental actions, such as expropriation or enforcement of customs or other laws that are not well developed or consistently enforced; the risks associated with our international operations, including local content, local currency or similar requirements especially in higher political risk countries where we operate; interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations; labor changes proposed by international conventions; increased regulatory burdens and oversight; changes in laws governing the taxation of foreign source income; retention of skilled workers; our participation in industry wide, multi-employer, defined pension plans; enforcement of laws related to the environment, labor and foreign corrupt practices; increased global concern, regulation and scrutiny regarding climate change; increased stockholder activism; the potential liability for remedial actions or assessments under existing or future environmental regulations or litigation; the effects of asserted and unasserted claims and the extent of available insurance coverage; the resolution of pending legal proceedings; and other risks and uncertainties detailed in this Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC. If one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize (or the consequences of any such development changes), or should our underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results or outcomes may vary materially from those reflected in our forward-looking statements. Forward-looking and other statements in this Form 10-K regarding our environmental, social and other sustainability plans, goals or activities are not an indication that these statements are necessarily material to investors or required to be disclosed in our filings with the SEC. In addition, historical, current, and forward-looking environmental, social and sustainability-related statements may be based on standards still developing, internal controls and processes that we continue to evolve, and assumptions subject to change in the future. Statements in this Form 10-K are made as of the date of this filing, and Tidewater disclaims any intention or obligation to update publicly or revise such statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. See “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for a discussion of certain risks relating to our business and investment in our securities.
 
In certain places in this Form 10-K, we may refer to reports published by third parties that purport to describe trends or developments in energy production and drilling and exploration activity and we specifically disclaim any responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of such information and have undertaken no steps to update or independently verify such information.
