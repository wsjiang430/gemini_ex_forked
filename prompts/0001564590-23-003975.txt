Our selling platforms bring the look and feel of an independent specialty shop through a distinctive store environment and high-energy sales personnel.

We believe that our customers desire authentic merchandise and fashion that is rooted in the fashion, music, art and culture of action sports, streetwear and other unique lifestyles to express their individuality.  We strive to keep our merchandising mix fresh by continuously introducing new brands, styles and categories of product.  Our focus on a diverse collection of brands allows us to quickly adjust to changing fashion trends.  We believe that our strategic mix of apparel, footwear, accessories and hardgoods, including skateboards, snowboards, bindings, components and other equipment, allows us to strengthen the potential of the brands we sell and helps to affirm our credibility with our customers.  In addition, we supplement our merchandise mix with a select offering of private label apparel and products as a value proposition that we believe complements our overall merchandise selection.
 Competitive Strengths
 We believe that the following competitive strengths differentiate us from our competitors and are critical to our continuing success.
 Attractive Lifestyle Retailing Concept.  We target a large population of young men and women, many of whom we believe are attracted to action sports, streetwear and other unique lifestyles and desire to express their personal independence and style through the apparel, footwear and accessories they wear and the equipment they use.  We believe we have developed a brand image that our customers view as consistent with their attitudes, fashion tastes and identity and differentiates us in our market.
 Differentiated Merchandising Strategy.  We have created a highly differentiated global retailing concept by offering an extensive selection of current and relevant lifestyle brands encompassing apparel, footwear, accessories and hardgoods.  The breadth of merchandise offered through our sales channels exceeds that offered by many of our competitors and includes some brands and products that are available only from us.  Many of our customers desire to update their wardrobes and equipment as fashion trends evolve or the season dictates, providing us the opportunity to shift our merchandise selection seasonally.  We believe that our ability to quickly recognize changing brand and style preferences and transition our merchandise offerings allows us to continually provide a compelling offering to our customers.
 Deep-rooted Culture.  We believe our culture and brand image enable us to successfully attract and retain high quality employees who are passionate and knowledgeable about the products we sell.  We place great emphasis on customer service and satisfaction, and we have made this a defining feature of our corporate culture.  To preserve our culture, we strive to promote from within and we provide our employees with the knowledge and tools to succeed through our comprehensive training programs and the empowerment to manage their stores to meet localized customer demand.
 Distinctive Customer Experience.  We strive to provide a convenient shopping environment that is appealing and clearly communicates our distinct brand image.  We seek to integrate our store and digital shopping experiences to serve our customers whenever, wherever and however they choose to engage with us.  We seek to attract knowledgeable sale associates who identify with our brand and are able to offer superior customer service, advice and product expertise.  We believe that our distinctive shopping experience enhances our image as a leading source for apparel and equipment for action sports, streetwear and other unique lifestyles.
 Disciplined Operating Philosophy.  We have an experienced senior management team.  Our management team has built a strong operating foundation based on sound retail principles that underlie our unique culture.  Our philosophy emphasizes an integrated combination of results measurement, training and incentive programs, all designed to drive sales productivity to the individual store associate level.  Our comprehensive training programs are designed to provide our employees with the knowledge and tools to develop leadership, communication, sales, and operational expertise.  We believe that our merchandising team immersion in the lifestyles we represent, supplemented with feedback from our customers, store associates, and omni-channel leadership, allows us to consistently identify and react to emerging fashion trends.  We believe that this, combined with our inventory planning and allocation processes and systems, helps us better manage markdown and fashion risk.

High-Impact, Integrated Marketing Approach.  We seek to build relationships with our customers through a multi-faceted marketing approach that is designed to integrate our brand images with the lifestyles we represent.  Our marketing efforts focus on reaching our customers in their environment and feature extensive grassroots digital and physical marketing events, as well as the Zumiez STASH loyalty program.  Our marketing efforts incorporate local sporting and music event promotions, interactive contest sponsorships that actively involve our customers with our brands and products and various social network channels.  Events and activities such as these provide opportunities for our customers to develop a strong identity with our culture and brands.  Our STASH loyalty program allows us to learn more about our customer and serve their needs better. We believe that our ability to interact with our customer, and our immersion in the lifestyles we represent, allows us to build credibility with our customers and gather valuable feedback on evolving customer preferences.
 Growth Strategy
 We intend to expand our presence as a leading global specialty retailer of action sports, streetwear, and other unique lifestyles by:
 Continuing to Generate Sales Growth through Existing Channels.  We seek to maximize our comparable sales through our integrated store and online shopping experiences and offering our customers a broad and relevant selection of brands and products, including a unique customer experience through each interaction with our brand. We believe in driving to the optimum store count in each physical geography that we operate in and optimizing comparable sales within these markets between physical and digital to drive total trade area sales growth.
 Enhancing our Brand Awareness through Continued Marketing and Promotion.  We believe that a key component of our success is the brand exposure that we receive from our marketing events, promotions, and activities that embody the unique lifestyles of our customers.  These are designed to assist us in increasing brand awareness in our existing markets and expanding into new markets by strengthening our connection with our target customer base.  We also use our STASH loyalty program to increase brand engagement and enhance brand creditability. We believe that our marketing efforts have also been successful in generating and promoting interest in our product offerings.  In addition, we use our ecommerce presence to further increase our brand awareness.  We plan to continue to expand our integrated marketing efforts by promoting more events and activities in our existing and new markets.  We also benefit from branded vendors’ marketing.
 Opening or Acquiring New Store Locations.  We believe our brand has appeal that provides select store expansion opportunities, particularly within our international markets.  During the last three fiscal years, we have opened 67 new stores consisting of 32 stores in fiscal 2022, 23 stores in fiscal 2021 and 12 stores in fiscal 2020.  We have successfully opened stores in diverse markets throughout the U.S. and internationally, which we believe demonstrates the portability and growth potential of our concepts. To take advantage of what we believe to be a compelling economic store model, we plan to open approximately 23 new stores in fiscal 2023, including stores in our existing markets and in new markets internationally. The number of anticipated store openings may increase or decrease due to market conditions and other factors. Our goal in opening stores is to not have one more store than needed to serve all our customers within a trade area.  
Merchandising and Purchasing
 Our goal is to be viewed by our customers as the definitive source of merchandise for their unique lifestyles across all channels in which we operate.  We believe that the breadth of merchandise that we offer our customers, which includes apparel, footwear, accessories, and hardgoods, exceeds that offered by many other specialty stores at a single location, and makes us a single-stop purchase destination for our target customers.
 We seek to identify fashion trends as they develop and to respond in a timely manner with a relevant product assortment.  We strive to keep our merchandising mix fresh by continuously introducing new brands or styles in response to the evolving desires of our customers.  Our merchandise mix may vary by region, country and season, reflecting the preferences and seasons in each market.

We believe that offering an extensive selection of current and relevant brands in sports, fashion, music and art is integral to our overall success.  No single third-party brand that we carry accounted for more than 6.3%, 7.9% and 9.4% of our net sales in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  We believe that our strategic mix of apparel, footwear, accessories and hardgoods allows us to strengthen the potential of the brands we sell and affirms our credibility with our customers.
 We believe that our ability to maintain an image consistent with the unique lifestyles of our customers is important to our key vendors.  Given our scale and market position, we believe that many of our key vendors view us as an important retail partner.  This position helps ensure our ability to procure a relevant product assortment and quickly respond to the changing fashion interests of our customers.  Additionally, we believe we are presented with a greater variety of products and styles by some of our vendors, as well as certain specially designed items that we exclusively distribute. We supplement our merchandise assortment with a select offering of private label products across many of our product categories.  Our private label products complement the branded products we sell, and some of our private label brands allow us to cater to the more value-oriented customer.  For fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, our private label merchandise represented 18.4%, 13.3%, and 11.4% of our net sales, respectively.
 We have developed a disciplined approach to buying and a dynamic inventory planning and allocation process to support our merchandise strategy.  We utilize a broad vendor base that allows us to shift our merchandise purchases as required to react quickly to changing consumer demands and market conditions.  We manage the purchasing and allocation process by reviewing branded merchandise lines from new and existing vendors, identifying emerging fashion trends and selecting branded merchandise styles in quantities, colors and sizes to meet inventory levels established by management.  We coordinate inventory levels in connection with individual stores’ sales strength, our promotions and seasonality. We utilize a localized fulfillment strategy to fulfill the vast majority of our ecommerce orders through our stores to enhance customer experience, maximize inventory productivity and reduce shipping time. 
 Our merchandising staff remains in tune with the fashion, music, art and culture of action sports, streetwear and other unique lifestyles by participating in lifestyles we support, attending relevant events and concerts, watching related programming and reading relevant publications and social network channels. In order to identify evolving trends and fashion preferences, our staff spends considerable time analyzing sales data, gathering feedback from our stores and customers, shopping in key markets and soliciting input from our vendors. With a global footprint, we are able to identify trends that emerge all over the world.  
 We source our private label merchandise from primarily foreign manufacturers around the world.  We have cultivated our private label sources with a view towards high quality merchandise, production reliability and consistency of fit.  We believe that our knowledge of fabric and production costs combined with a flexible sourcing base enables us to source high-quality private label goods at favorable costs.

Store Design and Environment.  We design our stores to create a distinctive and engaging shopping environment that we believe resonates with our customers.  Our stores feature an industrial look, dense merchandise displays, lifestyle focused posters and signage and popular music, all of which are consistent with the look and feel of an independent specialty shop.  Our stores are designed to encourage our customers to shop for longer periods of time, to interact with each other and our store associates and to visit our stores more frequently.  Our stores are constructed and finished to allow us to efficiently shift merchandise displays throughout the year as the season dictates.  At January 28, 2023, our stores averaged approximately 2,914 square feet.  All references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to square footage of our stores refers to gross square footage, including retail selling, storage and back-office space.  
 Expansion Opportunities and Site Selection.  In selecting a location for a new store, we target high-traffic locations with suitable demographics and favorable lease terms.  We generally locate our stores in areas in which other teen and young adult-oriented retailers have performed well.  We focus on evaluating the market specific competitive environment for potential new store locations.  We seek to diversify our store locations regionally and by caliber of mall or shopping area.  For mall locations, we seek locations near busy areas of the mall such as food courts, movie theaters, game stores and other popular teen and young adult retailers.  
 Store Management, Operations and Training.  We believe that our success is dependent in part on our ability to attract, train, retain and motivate qualified employees at all levels of our organization.  We have developed a corporate culture that we believe empowers the individual store managers to make store-level business decisions and consistently rewards their success.  We are committed to improving the skills and careers of our workforce and providing advancement opportunities for employees.
 We believe we provide our managers with the knowledge and tools to succeed through our comprehensive training programs and the flexibility to manage their stores to meet customer demands.  While general guidelines for our merchandise assortments, store layouts and in-store visuals are provided by our home offices, we give our managers substantial discretion to tailor their stores to the individual market and empower them to make store-level business decisions.  We design group training programs for our managers to improve both operational expertise and supervisory skills.
 Our store associates generally have an interest in the fashion, music, art and culture of the lifestyle we support and are knowledgeable about our products.  Through our training, evaluation and incentive programs, we seek to enhance the productivity of our store associates.  These programs are designed to promote a competitive, yet fun, culture that is consistent with the unique lifestyles we seek to promote.
 Marketing and Advertising
 We seek to reach our target customer audience through a multi-faceted marketing approach that is designed to integrate our brand image with the lifestyles we represent.  Our marketing efforts focus on reaching our customers in their environment, and feature extensive physical and digital grassroots marketing events, which give our customers an opportunity to experience and participate in the lifestyles we offer.  Our grassroots marketing events are built around the demographics of our customer base and offer an opportunity for our customers to develop a strong identity with our brands and culture.
 We have a customer loyalty program, the Zumiez STASH, which allows members to earn points for purchases or performance of certain activities.  The points can be redeemed for a broad range of rewards, including product and experiential rewards. Our marketing efforts also incorporate local sporting and music event promotions, advertising in magazines popular with our target market, interactive contest sponsorships that actively involve our customers with our brands and products, the Zumiez STASH, catalogs and various social network channels.  We believe that our immersion in action sports, streetwear and other unique lifestyles allows us to build credibility with our target audience and gather valuable feedback on evolving customer preferences.

Distribution and Fulfillment
 Timely and efficient distribution of merchandise to our stores is an important component of our overall business strategy.  Domestically, our distribution center is located in Corona, California.  At this facility, merchandise is inspected, allocated to stores and distributed to our stores and customers.  Each store is typically shipped merchandise five times a week, providing our stores with a steady flow of new merchandise.  We utilize a localized fulfillment strategy in which we use our domestic store network to provide fulfillment services for the vast majority of online customer purchases.
 Internationally, we operate distribution centers located in Delta, Canada, Graz, Austria, and Melbourne, Australia to support our operations in Canada, Europe and Australia, respectively. Each of our international entities are progressing toward full localized fulfillment and are in various states of implementation.
 Management Information Systems
 Our management information systems provide integration of store, online, merchandising, distribution, financial and human resources functions.  The systems include applications related to point-of-sale, inventory management, supply chain, planning, sourcing, merchandising and financial reporting.  We continue to invest in technology to align these systems with our business requirements and to support our continuing growth.
Competition
 The teenage and young adult retail apparel, hardgoods, footwear and accessories industry is highly competitive.  We compete with other retailers for vendors, customers, suitable store locations and qualified store associates, management personnel, online marketing content, social media engagement and ecommerce traffic. In the softgoods market, which includes apparel, footwear and accessories, we currently compete with other teenage and young adult focused retailers.  In addition, in the softgoods market we compete with independent specialty shops, department stores, vendors that sell their products directly to the retail market, non-mall retailers and ecommerce retailers.  In the hardgoods market, which includes skateboards, snowboards, bindings, components and other equipment, we compete directly or indirectly with the following categories of companies: other specialty retailers, such as local snowboard and skate shops, large-format sporting goods stores and chains, vendors who sell their products directly to the retail market and ecommerce retailers. 
 Competition in our sector is based on, among other things, merchandise offerings, store location, price, and the ability to identify with the customer.  We believe that our ability to compete favorably with our competitors is due to our differentiated merchandising strategy, compelling store environment and deep-rooted culture.
 Seasonality
 Historically, our operations have been seasonal, with the largest portion of net sales and net income occurring in the third and fourth fiscal quarters, reflecting increased demand during the back-to-school and winter holiday selling seasons.  During fiscal 2022, approximately 54% of our net sales occurred in the third and fourth quarters combined.  As a result of this seasonality, any factors negatively affecting us during the last half of the year, including unfavorable economic conditions, adverse weather or our ability to acquire seasonal merchandise inventory, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations for the entire year.  Our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate based upon such factors as the timing of certain holiday seasons, the popularity of seasonal merchandise offered, the timing and amount of markdowns, competitive influences and the number and timing of new store openings, remodels and closings.
Trademarks
 The “Zumiez”, “Blue Tomato” and “Fast Times” trademarks and certain other trademarks, have been registered, or are the subject of pending trademark applications, with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and with the registries of certain foreign countries.  We regard our trademarks as valuable and intend to maintain such marks and any related registrations and vigorously protect our trademarks.  We also own numerous domain names, which have been registered with the Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.

Employees
 At January 28, 2023, we employed approximately 2,600 full-time and approximately 6,800 part-time employees globally.  However, the number of part-time employees fluctuates depending on our seasonal needs and generally increases during peak selling seasons, particularly the back-to-school and the winter holiday seasons.  None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we believe that our relationship with our employees is positive. 
 We believe in delivering quality employment experiences at all levels within the Company.  In that regard, every year we create thousands of career opportunities in our stores for individuals who are just beginning their professional careers and who are driven to develop new skills in an environment centered around teaching and learning. Many of these opportunities are provided to our part-time sales associates, who on average are approximately 19 years of age, and are often furthering their career through concurrent education and/or additional employment opportunities.
The Zumiez culture is built on a set of shared values that have been in place since the inception of the business. These shared values include empowered managers, teaching and learning, competition, recognition, and fairness and honesty.  Our culture strives to integrate quality teaching and learning experiences throughout the organization. We do this through a comprehensive training program, which primarily focuses on sales, management and customer service training in our stores and is more focused on professional development in our home office. Our training programs have been developed internally and are almost exclusively taught internally by Zumiez employees to Zumiez employees. The training programs have been developed to empower our employees to make good business decisions.
 We believe Zumiez is a place where people have a voice, will be heard, and have bias-free opportunities.  Accordingly, our work place is built upon the foundation of inclusion and equity where its people are diverse in their backgrounds, communities, and points of view, yet all share the same core cultural values of working hard, giving back and empowering others.  In this regard, we strive for our employees within a trade area to be reflective of the communities they serve.  Pay equity, meaning pay parity between employees performing similar job duties, without regard for race or gender, is a base line component of this focus on inclusion and equity and something we evaluate as part of our pay practice procedures.
