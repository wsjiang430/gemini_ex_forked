Item 1. Business. 
OVERVIEW 
 We are a diversified manufacturer of railcars and railcar components. We design and manufacture a broad variety of railcar types for transportation of bulk commodities and containerized freight products primarily in North America, including open top hoppers, covered hoppers, and gondolas along with intermodal and non-intermodal flat cars. We and our predecessors have been manufacturing railcars since 1901. Over the last several years, we have introduced a number of new or redesigned railcar types as we continue to diversify our product portfolio. We believe we are the leading manufacturer of aluminum-bodied railcars including coal cars in North America, based on the number of railcars delivered. 
 Our railcar manufacturing facilities are located in Cherokee, Alabama (Shoals) and Roanoke, Virginia. Our Shoals facility is an important part of our long-term growth strategy as we continue to expand our railcar product and service offerings. On February 28, 2018, we acquired substantially all of the operating assets at the Shoals facility of Navistar, Inc. (Navistar) and its subsidiary, International Truck and Engine Investments Corporation, including their railcar business, and assumed the lease for the facility (the Acquisition). Our Roanoke facility has the capacity to build a variety of railcar types in a cost-effective manner and will continue to support our coal car products as market conditions improve. Our former Danville, Illinois facility was idled for railcar production effective March 31, 2017 and sold in August 2018. 
 We lease freight cars through our JAIX Leasing Company subsidiary. Although we continually look for opportunities to package our leased assets for sale to our leasing company partners, these leased assets may not be converted to sales, and may remain revenue producing assets into the foreseeable future. We also rebuild and convert railcars and sell forged, cast and fabricated parts for all of the railcars we produce, as well as those manufactured by others. 
 Our primary customers are financial institutions, railroads and shippers, which represented 42%, 27% and 15%, respectively, of our total sales attributable to each type of customer for the year ended December 31, 2018. In the year ended December 31, 2018, we delivered 4,214 railcars, including 2,584 new railcars, 1,205 rebuilt railcars and 425 leased railcars, compared to 4,427 railcars delivered in the year ended December 31, 2017, including 4,305 new railcars, 47 rebuilt railcars and 75 leased railcars. Our total backlog of firm orders for railcars decreased from 2,392 railcars as of December 31, 2017 to 1,699 railcars as of December 31, 2018. Our backlog as of December 31, 2018 includes a variety of railcar types. The estimated sales value of our backlog is $160 million as of December 31, 2018.

 The types of railcars listed below include the major types of railcars that we are capable of manufacturing; however, some of the types of railcars listed below have not been ordered by any of our customers or manufactured by us in a number of years. We rebuild and convert railcars and sell forged, cast and fabricated parts for all of the railcars we produce, as well as those manufactured by others. Many of our railcars are produced using a patented one-piece center sill, the main longitudinal structural component of the railcar. The one-piece center sill provides a higher carrying capacity, but weighs significantly less than traditional multiple-piece center sills. In addition to railcars designed for use in North America, we have manufactured railcars for export to Latin America and the Middle East. Railroads outside of North America are constructed with a variety of track gauges that are sized differently than in North America, which requires us, in some cases, to alter our manufacturing specifications accordingly. 
 Any of the railcar types listed below may be further developed to meet the characteristics of the materials being transported and customer specifications.

MANUFACTURING 
 We have railcar production facilities in Cherokee, Alabama and Roanoke, Virginia. Our facilities are each certified or approved for certification by the Association of American Railroads (the AAR), which sets railcar manufacturing industry standards for quality control. Our Shoals manufacturing facility delivered its first railcars during the fourth quarter of 2013 and provides a solid platform from which to pursue a broad range of non-coal car business including intermodal well cars, non-intermodal flat cars and various open-top hopper, covered hopper and gondola cars. During 2015, we expanded our Shoals facility to add additional production capacity to meet demand for our new types of railcars. On February 28, 2018, we acquired substantially all of the operating assets of Navistar, Inc. and its subsidiary, International Truck and Engine Investments Corporation, at the Shoals facility, including their railcar business (the Acquisition). Our former Danville facility was idled for railcar production effective March 31, 2017 and sold in August 2018. 
 Our manufacturing process involves four basic steps: fabrication, assembly, finishing and inspection. Each of our facilities has numerous checkpoints at which we inspect products to maintain quality control, a process that our operations management continuously monitors. In our fabrication processes, we employ standard metal working tools, many of which are computer controlled. Each assembly line typically involves 15 to 20 manufacturing positions, depending on the complexity of the particular railcar design. We use mechanical fastening in the fitting and assembly of our aluminum-bodied railcar parts, while we typically use welding for the assembly of our steel-bodied railcars. For aluminum-bodied railcars, we begin the finishing process by cleaning the railcars surface and then applying the decals. In the case of steel-bodied railcars, we begin the finishing process by blasting the surface area of the railcar, painting it and then applying decals. Once we have completed the finishing process, our employees, along with representatives of the customer purchasing the particular railcars, inspect all railcars for adherence to specifications. 
 CUSTOMERS 
 We have strong long-term relationships with many large purchasers of railcars. Long-term customer relationships are particularly important in the railcar industry, given the limited number of buyers of railcars. 
 Our customer base consists mostly of North American financial institutions, railroads and shippers and. We believe that our customers preference for reliable, high-quality products, the relatively high cost for customers to switch manufacturers, our technological leadership in developing and enhancing innovative products and the competitive pricing of our railcars have helped us maintain our long-standing relationships with our customers. 
 In 2018, revenue from three customers, BNSF Railway, Wells Fargo Rail Corporation and Transtar, Inc., accounted for approximately 26%, 19% and 10%, respectively, of total revenue. In 2018, sales to our top five customers accounted for approximately 71% of total revenue. In 2017, revenue from three customers, TTX Company, CIT Rail and ECN Capital Corporation, accounted for approximately 21%, 15% and 12%, respectively, of total revenue. In 2017, sales to our top five customers accounted for approximately 70% of total revenue. Our railcar sales to customers outside the United States were $12.9 million and $23.2 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Many of our customers do not purchase railcars every year since railcar fleets are not necessarily replenished or augmented every year. The size and frequency of railcar orders often results in a small number of customers representing a significant portion of our sales in a given year. Although we have long-standing relationships with many of our major customers, the loss of any significant portion of our sales to any major customer, the loss of a single major customer or a material adverse change in the financial condition of any one of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 SALES AND MARKETING 
 Our direct sales group is organized geographically and consists of regional sales managers and contract administrators, a manager of customer service and support staff. The regional sales managers are responsible for managing customer relationships. Our contract administrators are responsible for preparing proposals and other inside sales activities. Our manager of customer service is responsible for after-sale follow-up and in-field product performance reviews. 
 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
 We utilize the latest engineering methods, tools and processes to ensure that new products and processes meet our customers requirements and are delivered in a timely manner. We develop and introduce new railcar designs as a result of a combination of customer feedback and close observation of developing market trends. We work closely with our customers to understand their expectations and design railcars that meet their needs. New product designs are tested and validated for compliance with AAR standards prior to introduction. This comprehensive approach provides the criteria and direction that ensure we are developing products that our customers desire and perform as expected. Costs associated with research and development are expensed as incurred and totaled $42,000 and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
BACKLOG 
 We define backlog as the value of those products or services which our customers have committed in writing to purchase from us or lease from us when built, but which have not yet been recognized as sales. Our contracts may include cancellation clauses under which customers are required, upon cancellation of the contract, to reimburse us for costs incurred in reliance on an order and in some cases, to compensate us for lost profits. However, customer orders may be subject to customer requests for delays in railcar deliveries, inspection rights and other customary industry terms and conditions, which could prevent or delay backlog from being converted into sales. 
 The following table depicts our reported railcar backlog in number of railcars and estimated future sales value attributable to such backlog, for the periods shown. 
 

 | Year Ended December 31, | 
 | 2018 | | | 2017 | 
Railcar backlog at start of period | | 2,392 | | | | 4,259 | 
Railcars delivered | | (4,214 | ) | | | (4,427 | )
Net railcar orders received (canceled) | | 3,521 | | | | 2,560 | 
Railcar backlog at end of period (1) | | 1,699 | | | | 2,392 | 
Estimated revenue from backlog at end of period (in thousands) (2) | $ | 160,157 | | | $ | 181,117 | 


(1) | Railcar backlog includes 0 and 599 rebuilt railcars as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Estimated revenue from backlog reflects the total revenue attributable to the backlog reported at the end of the period as if such backlog were converted to actual sales. Estimated revenue from backlog does not reflect potential price increases and decreases under customer contracts that provide for variable pricing based on changes in the cost of raw materials. Although we continually look for opportunities to package our leased assets for sale to our leasing company partners, these leased assets may not be converted to sales.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Although our reported backlog is typically converted to sales within two years, our reported backlog may not be converted to sales in any particular period, if at all, and the actual sales from these contracts may not equal our reported backlog estimates. In addition, due to the large size of railcar orders and variations in the mix of railcars, the size of our reported backlog at the end of any given period may fluctuate significantly.

 SUPPLIERS AND MATERIALS 
 The cost of raw materials and components represents a substantial majority of the manufacturing costs of most of our railcar product lines. As a result, the management of raw materials and components purchasing is critical to our profitability. We enjoy generally strong relationships with our suppliers, which helps to ensure access to supplies when railcar demand is high. 
 Our primary aluminum suppliers are Mandel Metals and Champagne Metals. Aluminum prices generally are not fixed at the time a railcar order is accepted due to our infrequent usage and subsequent low volume purchases of aluminum. Our primary carbon steel and fabrication suppliers are Steel Warehouse, ONeal Steel, and Ryerson. We do have fixed pricing, based on futures, established on our raw sheet steel for dedicated tonnage. 
 Our primary component suppliers include Wabtec, New York Air Brake, SKF, and Amsted, Inc., who supplies us with truck components, brake components, couplers and bearings. Also, Standard Steel (a subsidiary of Summit Railroad Products, Inc.) supplies us with axles and wheels. Roll Form Group is the sole supplier of our roll-formed center sills, which were used in 87% and 43% of our new railcars produced in 2018 and 2017, respectively. A center sill is the primary longitudinal structural component of a railcar, which helps the railcar withstand the weight of the cargo and the force of being pulled during transport. Our center sill is formed into its final shape without heating by passing steel plate through a series of rollers. 
 In addition, through the date of the Acquisition, International Truck and Engine Investments Corporation, an affiliate of Navistar, Inc., supplied us with various fabricated parts, components and subassemblies and provided truck and wheel and axle assembly services and blast and paint finishing services primarily for our Shoals facility. Other suppliers provide brake systems, castings, bearings, fabrications and various other components. The railcar industry is periodically subject to supply constraints for some of the key railcar components. 
 Except as described above, there are usually at least two suppliers for each of our raw materials and specialty components. No single supplier accounted for more than 12% and 20% of our total purchases in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our top ten suppliers accounted for 48% and 72% of our total purchases in 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
 COMPETITION 
 We operate in a highly competitive marketplace especially in periods of low market demand resulting in excess manufacturing capacity and face substantial competition from established competitors in the railcar industry in North America. In addition to price, competition is based on delivery timing, product performance and technological innovation, reputation for product quality and customer service and support. 
 We have four principal competitors in the North American railcar market that primarily manufacture railcars for third-party customers, which are Trinity Industries, Inc., The Greenbrier Companies, Inc., American Railcar Industries, Inc. and National Steel Car Limited. 
 Competition in the North American market from railcar manufacturers located outside of North America is limited by, among other factors, high shipping costs and familiarity with the North American market. 
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
 We have several U.S. and international patents and pending applications, registered trademarks, copyrights and trade names. Key patents include our one-piece center sill, our hopper railcar with automatic individual door system and our railroad car tub. The protection of our intellectual property is important to our business. 
EMPLOYEES 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,077 employees, of whom 183 were salaried and 894 were hourly wage earners, and approximately 50, or 5%, of our employees were members of unions. As of December 31, 2017, we had 985 employees, of whom 177 were salaried and 808 were hourly wage earners, and approximately 60, or 6%, of our employees were members of unions. On August 9, 2017, we reached an agreement with the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America to terminate a collective bargaining agreement that covered 10% of our employees as of December 31, 2016.

 REGULATION 
 The Federal Railroad Administration, or FRA, administers and enforces U.S. federal laws and regulations relating to railroad safety. These regulations govern equipment and safety compliance standards for freight railcars and other rail equipment used in interstate commerce. The AAR promulgates a wide variety of rules and regulations governing safety and design of equipment, relationships among railroads with respect to freight railcars in interchange and other matters. The AAR also certifies freight railcar manufacturers and component manufacturers that provide equipment for use on railroads in the United States as well as providers of railcar repair and maintenance services. New products must generally undergo AAR testing and approval processes. As a result of these regulations, we must maintain certifications with the AAR as a freight railcar manufacturer and products that we sell must meet AAR and FRA standards. 
 We are also subject to oversight in other jurisdictions by foreign regulatory agencies and to the extent that we expand our business internationally, we will increasingly be subject to the regulations of other non-U.S. jurisdictions. 
 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 
 We are subject to comprehensive federal, state, local and international environmental laws and regulations relating to the release or discharge of materials into the environment, the management, use, processing, handling, storage, transport or disposal of hazardous materials, or otherwise relating to the protection of human health and the environment. These laws and regulations not only expose us to liability for our own negligent acts, but also may expose us to liability for the conduct of others or for our actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time these actions were taken. In addition, these laws may require significant expenditures to achieve compliance, and are frequently modified or revised to impose new obligations. Civil and criminal fines and penalties may be imposed for non-compliance with these environmental laws and regulations. Our operations that involve hazardous materials also raise potential risks of liability under the common law. 
 Environmental operating permits are, or may be, required for our operations under these laws and regulations. These operating permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation. We regularly monitor and review our operations, procedures and policies for compliance with these laws and regulations. Despite these compliance efforts, risk of environmental liability is inherent in the operation of our businesses, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses. We believe that our operations and facilities are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations and that any noncompliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition. 
 Future events, such as changes in or modified interpretations of existing laws and regulations or enforcement policies, or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of products or business activities, may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations. In addition, we have in the past conducted investigation and remediation activities at properties that we own to address historic contamination. To date, such costs have not been material. Although we believe we have satisfactorily addressed all known material contamination through our remediation activities, there can be no assurance that these activities have addressed all historic contamination. The discovery of historic contamination or the release of hazardous substances into the environment could require us in the future to incur investigative or remedial costs or other liabilities that could be material or that could interfere with the operation of our business. 
 In addition to environmental laws, the transportation of commodities by railcar raises potential risks in the event of a derailment or other accident. Generally, liability under existing law in the United States for a derailment or other accident depends on the negligence of the party, such as the railroad, the shipper or the manufacturer of the railcar or its components. However, for the shipment of certain hazardous commodities, strict liability concepts may apply.
