Item 1. Business.
Overview
Edgewell Personal Care Company, and its subsidiaries, is one of the world’s largest manufacturers and marketers of personal care products in the wet shave, sun and skin care, feminine care and infant care categories. We have a portfolio of over 25 brands and a broad global footprint in more than 50 countries. 
History and Development
We were incorporated in the state of Missouri on September 23, 1999 and, prior to April 2000, were a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ralston Purina Company. On April 1, 2000, all of the outstanding shares of our common stock were distributed to shareholders of Ralston Purina Company and we became an independent publicly-owned company. During the years that followed, we implemented a strategy of acquiring several personal care brands, which created the foundation for the company we are today.
In 2003, we completed the acquisition of the Schick-Wilkinson Sword business (“SWS”) from Pfizer, Inc., which was the second largest manufacturer and marketer of men’s and women’s wet shave products in the world. Our portfolio of wet shave products includes: Hydro® and Quattro® men’s shaving systems; Hydro Silk®, Quattro for Women®, Intuition® and Silk Effects® Plus women’s shaving systems; and the Hydro, Quattro, Xtreme 3®, Slim Twin®, Slim Triple® and Extra3® disposables. SWS has over 75 years of history in the shaving products industry with a reputation for high quality and innovation in shaving technology. SWS products are sold throughout the world. 
In 2007, we acquired Playtex Products, Inc. (“Playtex”), expanding our branded consumer products portfolio. Playtex was a leading manufacturer and marketer of well-recognized brands such as Playtex® feminine care products, Playtex infant care products, Diaper Genie® diaper disposal systems, Wet Ones® pre-moistened wipes, and Banana Boat® and Hawaiian Tropic® sun care products. 
In 2009, we completed the acquisition of the Edge® and Skintimate® shave preparation brands from S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc., adding United States (“U.S.”) market leading shave preparation brands to our existing wet shave product portfolio. In 2010, we completed the acquisition of American Safety Razor, LLC (“ASR”), a leading global manufacturer of private label and value wet shaving razors and blades and specialty blades. ASR was founded in 1875.
Strengthening our company’s feminine care product portfolio, in 2013 we acquired the Stayfree® pad, Carefree® liner and o.b.® tampon feminine hygiene brands in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean from Johnson & Johnson.
In 2015, we completed the separation of our Household Products business, which manufactures and markets batteries and portable lighting, into a separate publicly-traded company (the “Spin” or the “Separation”). We completed the tax-free Separation by distributing 100% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Energizer SpinCo, Inc. to our shareholders. The newly formed company assumed the name Energizer Holdings, Inc. (“New Energizer”) and began trading under the symbol “ENR” on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”). Edgewell retained the Personal Care business and trades on the NYSE under the symbol “EPC.” Following the Separation, we do not beneficially own any shares of New Energizer. In connection with the Separation, we changed our name to Edgewell Personal Care Company on June 30, 2015.
On October 31, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Bulldog Skincare Holdings Limited, a men’s grooming and skincare products company based in the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”). On March 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Jack Black, L.L.C., a men’s luxury skincare products company based in the U.S. These acquisitions have created opportunities to expand our personal care portfolio into a growing global category and have allowed us to leverage our international geographic footprint.
Our Business Segments and Product Strategies
We manage our business in four reportable segments: Wet Shave, Sun and Skin Care, Feminine Care and All Other. Segment performance is evaluated based on segment profit, exclusive of general corporate expenses, share-based compensation costs, costs associated with restructuring initiatives and other items that are not representative of management’s view on how segment performance is evaluated. Information regarding the product portfolios of these segments is included within the following discussion. Financial information regarding each of our reportable segments, as well as other geographical information, is included in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Wet Shave
Wet Shave products are sold under the Schick®, Wilkinson Sword®, Edge, Skintimate, Shave Guard® and Personna® brand names. We manufacture and distribute Schick and Wilkinson Sword razor systems, composed of razor handles and refillable blades, and disposable shave products for men and women. While we market our wet shave products throughout the world, our primary markets are the U.S., Canada, Japan, Germany, France and the U.K. We believe we hold the number two global market share position in wet shaving. The category is highly competitive, with manufacturers vying for consumer loyalty and retail shelf space. 
We have gained recognition for our innovation designed to improve the shaving experience, including the introduction of our Schick Hydro men’s shaving system in 2010. 
During 2017, we launched our first direct-to-consumer site in the U.S., featuring our new Hydro Connect™ innovation. Hydro Connect, which is also available in certain markets internationally, features cartridges with three- and five-blade Hydro technology that fit on Gillette® handles. Additionally, during 2017, we launched our Schick Quattro YOU™ disposables for women in North America, which have a unique SmoothProtect™ four-blade design to protect skin and a slimmer handle for greater control. 
In 2018, we introduced Intuition f.a.b.™ for women which has five bi-directional blades that shave up and down. We intend to continue to develop and expand across our Wet Shave brands, including Hydro, Quattro, Intuition and Xtreme 3.
In 2019, we entered into a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger with Harry’s, Inc (“Harry’s”). We intend to utilize the combined resources of our Company and Harry’s to create a next-generation consumer products platform with an expansive runway for accelerated topline growth and enhanced value creation.
In the U.S., Canada and Japan, we also sell market-leading shave preparation products, including shaving gels and creams under the Edge, Skintimate and Shave Guard brands.
We also manufacture, distribute and sell a complete line of private label and value-priced wet shaving disposable razors, shaving systems and replacement blades. These wet shave products are sold primarily under a retailer’s store name or under value brand names such as Personna.
Sun and Skin Care
Sun and Skin Care products are sold under the Banana Boat, Hawaiian Tropic, Bulldog®, Jack Black® and Wet Ones brand names. We market Sun Care products under the Banana Boat and Hawaiian Tropic brands and believe these brands, on a combined basis, hold a leading market share position in the U.S. sun care category. We compete across the full spectrum of Sun Care categories: general protection, sport, kids, baby, tanning and after sun. Outside the U.S., we believe we are also the leading Sun Care manufacturer in Australia and Mexico. We expect to continue to drive our worldwide business through innovation, increased distribution and geographic expansion. 
Our Bulldog skincare products are purpose built for men and were created to work simply and efficiently while dealing with issues specific to men’s skin. Since acquiring the brand in October 2016, we have expanded sales geographically and are committed to further growth and distribution for the brand. We acquired the Jack Black brand in March 2018 to obtain a footprint in the luxury men’s skincare market. We will use resources at our disposal to grow the Jack Black brand globally. We also offer Wet Ones, the leader in the U.S. portable hand wipes category, and offered Playtex household gloves until the sale of those assets in October 2017.
Feminine Care
In Feminine Care, we market products under the Playtex, Stayfree, Carefree and o.b. brands. We offer tampons under the Playtex Gentle Glide® 360°™, Playtex Sport®, Playtex and o.b. brands, including the Playtex Sport compact tampon launched in 2017. We also market pads and liners under the Stayfree and Carefree brands. We believe we are one of the top three manufacturers of feminine care products in North America, with unique, competitive product technologies and well-known brands that address complementary consumer needs. We intend to continue to invest in innovation in our feminine care brands. 
All Other
Our All Other segment includes infant care, pet care and miscellaneous other products. In the infant care category, we believe our Playtex Diaper Genie brand of diaper disposal systems leads the U.S. diaper pail category. The Diaper Genie brand consists of the diaper pail unit and refill liners. We also market Litter Genie®, a waste disposal solution for cat owners originating from our Diaper Genie technology. Additionally, we market a broad range of products including bottles, cups and mealtime products under the Playtex brand name, and a line of pacifiers, including the OrthoPro® and Binky® pacifiers. In October 2019, we announced the sale of our infant and pet care assets.
Competition
The personal care product categories are highly competitive, both in the U.S. and on a global basis, as large manufacturers with global operations and new entrants attempting to disrupt the market compete for consumer acceptance and, increasingly, limited retail shelf space. The continued growth in online sales also puts additional competitive pressure on our Company. Competition is based upon brand perception, product performance, customer service and price.
The global shaving products category is comprised of wet shave blades and razors, electric shavers and shaving gels and creams. With our established product lines and global presence, we believe we compete effectively in this market. Our principal competitors in the global wet shave business are The Procter & Gamble Company, which owns the Gillette brand and is the leading company in the global wet shave segment, Bic Group, which is expanding beyond its historical strength in the disposable segment, and Dorco, which competes primarily in the private label segment. We also compete with newer entrants to the Wet Shave market for both direct-to-consumer online and traditional retail shelf space including Unilever (Dollar Shave Club brand), Harry's, Perio (Barbasol and PureSilk brands), Beiersdorf (recently launched Nivea branded women’s wet shave product in Germany), and numerous online start-ups.
The markets for sun and skin care, feminine care and other personal care products are also highly competitive, characterized by frequent introduction of new products, accompanied by major advertising and promotional programs. Our competitors in these markets consist of a large number of domestic and foreign companies, including The Procter & Gamble Company and Kimberly-Clark Corp. in feminine care; Bayer AG and Johnson & Johnson in sun and skin care; and a variety of competitors in the fragmented infant care market. 
The market for sun care products is also characterized by global growth and is impacted by trends in skin care. With our balanced sun care portfolio, depth of sun care expertise and global presence, we believe we compete effectively and have more than doubled our international sun care business since acquiring the Banana Boat and Hawaiian Tropic brands in 2008. We intend to continue to compete by driving innovation, building differentiated equity and focusing on in-store visibility.
The global men’s skincare market is expected to continue to grow, with increased demand for men’s personal care products. Our competitors in this market include large companies such as Johnson & Johnson, L’Oréal S.A., The Estee Lauder Companies, Inc. and Unilever, as well as smaller companies. We compete in the market at multiple price points by creating simple and effective skincare products with natural ingredients at an affordable price through our Bulldog products and the luxury men’s skincare market with Jack Black. 
With our fiscal 2014 acquisition of the Stayfree, Carefree and o.b. brands, we have expanded our presence within the feminine care product category and have become one of the top three manufacturers in North America. We compete by having a portfolio of well-known brands that address complementary consumer needs. 
Sales and Distribution
Our products are marketed primarily through a direct sales force, but also through exclusive and non-exclusive distributors and wholesalers. In the U.S., Japan and the larger countries of Western Europe and Latin America, we have dedicated commercial organizations, reflecting the scale and importance of these businesses. During fiscal 2015, in order to compete more effectively in smaller markets after the Separation, we increased our use of third-party distributors and wholesalers and either decreased or eliminated our business operations in certain countries. As a result of increased competition through the expansion of online markets, we have established e-commerce operations across several lines of business including the Schick.com website in the U.S. providing men’s and women’s shaving products, a Bulldog direct to consumer site in the U.K. with plans to expand to the U.S., and acceleration of e-commerce sales in China through our partnership with T-Mall. We distribute our products to consumers through numerous retail locations worldwide, including mass merchandisers and warehouse clubs, food, drug and convenience stores, and military stores. 
Although a large percentage of our sales are attributable to a relatively small number of retail customers, only Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Wal-Mart”), as a group, account for more than 10% of our consolidated annual net sales. Wal-Mart accounted for approximately 23% of our net sales from continuing operations in fiscal 2019. Purchases by Wal-Mart included products from all of our segments. Target Corporation represented approximately 11% and 14% of net sales for our Feminine Care and All Other segments, respectively. Sales to Amazon in fiscal 2019 represented approximately 21% of net sales for our All Other segment.
Generally, orders are shipped within a month of their order date. Because of the short period of time between order and shipment dates, the dollar amount of current backlog is not material and is not considered to be a reliable indicator of future sales volume.
Government contracts do not represent a material portion of our net sales.
Seasonality
Customer orders for sun care products within our Sun and Skin Care segment are highly seasonal, which has historically resulted in higher sun care sales to retailers during the late winter through mid-summer months. Within our Wet Shave segment, sales of women’s products are moderately seasonal, with increased consumer demand in the spring and summer months. See “Our business is subject to seasonal volatility” in Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
The principal raw materials used in our products include steel, various plastic resins, plastic based components, textile fibers and non-woven fabrics, organic and inorganic chemicals, soap based lubricants and plastic-pulp based packaging. These materials are sourced on a regional or global basis, as applicable, and are generally available from multiple sources. Price and availability of our raw materials fluctuate over time. While we have confidence our supply assurance plans adequately support our current operational needs, we cannot predict the future with certainty. Both price and supply are subject to risk from global socio- and macroeconomic influences such as, but not exclusive to, force majeure, loss or impairment to key manufacturing sites, transportation, government regulation, currency or other unforeseen circumstances. In the past, we have avoided significant interruption in the availability of our input materials and believe our extensive experience in procurement allows us to manage these risks effectively. 
Patents, Technology and Trademarks
We own a number of U.S. and international trademarks, which we consider of substantial importance and which are used individually or in conjunction with our other trademarks. These include, but are not limited to: Edgewell®, Schick, Schick Hydro, Schick Hydro Silk, Hydro Connect, Wilkinson Sword, Intuition, Quattro, Xtreme 3, Protector, Silk Effects, Slim Twin, Edge, Skintimate, Personna, Banana Boat, Hawaiian Tropic, Bulldog, Jack Black, Binky, Diaper Genie, Litter Genie, Drop-Ins®, Gentle Glide, 360°, Play On®, Twist ‘N Click®, Sport, Sport Level Protection®, VentAire®, Wet Ones, Stayfree, Carefree and o.b. As a result of the Playtex acquisition, we also own royalty-free licenses in perpetuity to the Playtex trademark in the U.S. and in many international jurisdictions related to certain feminine hygiene, baby care and other products, but excluding certain apparel-related products. We consider the protection of our trademarks to be important to our business.
Our ability to compete effectively in the Wet Shave, Sun and Skin care, Feminine Care and Other personal care categories depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of technology and manufacturing processes through a combination of patent and trade secret protection, non-disclosure agreements and licensing agreements. We own or license from third parties a considerable number of patents, patent applications and other technology, which we believe are important to our business. These relate primarily to shaving product improvements and additional features, feminine care hygiene products including digital and applicator tampons, pads and liners, baby bottles and nipples, disposable liners and plastic holders for nurser systems, children’s drinking cups, pacifiers, sunscreen formulations, diaper disposal systems, pet care and pet waste disposal products, and manufacturing processes.
As of September 30, 2019, we owned, either directly or beneficially, approximately 654 unexpired U.S. patents, which have a range of expiration dates from October 2019 to August 2038, and we had approximately 108 U.S. patent applications pending. We routinely prepare additional patent applications for filing in the U.S., and actively pursue foreign patent protection in various countries. As of September 30, 2019, we owned, either directly or beneficially, approximately 1,581 foreign patents having a range of expiration dates from October 2019 to November 2043, and we had approximately 201 patent applications pending in foreign countries.
We rely on trademark, trade secret, patent and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property rights. We cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be effectively utilized or, if necessary, successfully asserted. There is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own intellectual property rights, or, where appropriate, license intellectual property rights from others.
Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters
We are subject to various federal, state, foreign and local laws and regulations by governmental agencies intended to protect the public health and environment, including those governing the manufacture, use, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, labeling and notice requirements related to consumer exposure to certain chemicals, and requirements for the recycling of our products and their packaging. These agencies include, but are not limited to (i) the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and equivalent international agencies that regulate ingredients in consumer products, (ii) the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and equivalent international agencies that regulate our manufacturing facilities, and (iii) the Chemical Registration/Notification authorities that regulate chemicals that we use in, or transport to, the various countries in which we manufacture and/or market our products. We have seen an increase in registration and reporting requirements concerning the use of certain chemicals in a number of countries, such as the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”) regulations in the European Union (the “E.U.”).
Contamination has been identified at certain of our current and former facilities, as well as third-party waste disposal sites, and we are conducting investigation and remediation activities in relation to such properties. In connection with certain sites, we have received notices from the EPA, state agencies and private parties seeking contribution, that we have been identified as a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and, as a result, we may be required to share in the cost of cleanup with respect to a number of federal “Superfund” sites. In addition to potential costs to clean up our own properties, we may also be required to share in the cost of cleanup with respect to state-designated sites and certain international locations.
The amount of our ultimate liability in connection with those sites may depend on many factors, including the volume and toxicity of material contributed to the site, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability, and the remediation methods and technology to be used. Total environmental capital expenditures and operating expenses are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our total capital and operating expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position. Current environmental spending estimates could be modified as a result of changes in our plans or our understanding of the underlying facts, changes in legal requirements, including any requirements related to global climate change, or other factors.
Many European countries, as well as the E.U, have been very active in adopting and enforcing environmental regulations. As such, it is possible that new regulations may increase the risk and expense of doing business in such countries.
The US Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”) and similar laws in other jurisdictions, are intended to ensure that chemicals do not pose unreasonable risks to human health or the environment. TSCA requires the EPA to maintain the TSCA registry listing chemicals manufactured or processed in the United States. Chemicals not listed on the TSCA registry cannot be imported into or sold in the U.S. until registered with the EPA. TSCA also sets forth specific reporting, recordkeeping and testing rules for chemicals, including requirements for the import and export of certain chemicals, as well as other restrictions relevant to our business. Pursuant to these laws, the EPA from time to time issues Significant New Use Rules, or SNURs, when it identifies new uses of chemicals that could pose risks to human health or the environment and also requires pre-manufacture notification of new chemical substances that do not appear on the TSCA registry. When we import chemicals into the U.S., we must ensure that chemicals appear on the TSCA registry prior to import, participate in the SNUR process when a chemical we import requires testing data and report to the EPA information relating to quantities, identities and uses of imported chemicals.
In the E.U., our business is affected by legislation dealing with REACH which requires manufacturers and importers of chemical substances to register such substances with the European Chemicals Agency, or the ECHA, and enables European and national authorities to track such substances. Depending on the amount of chemical substances to be manufactured or imported, and the specific risks of each substance, REACH requires different sets of data to be included in the registration submitted to the ECHA. Registration of substances with the ECHA imposes significant recordkeeping requirements that can result in significant financial obligations for companies such as ours to import products into Europe. REACH is accompanied by legislation regulating the classification, labeling and packaging of chemical substances and mixtures.
We believe that our facilities and products are in substantial compliance with current laws and regulations. 
Employees
As of September 30, 2019, we employed approximately 6,000 employees, with approximately 2,200 based in the U.S. Certain of these employees are represented by unions or work councils. We believe that we generally have a good relationship with our employees, and with the unions and work councils that represent certain employees.
