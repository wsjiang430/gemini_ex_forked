ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Cardlytics makes marketing more relevant and measurable through our purchase intelligence platform. Our partnerships with financial institutions ("FIs") provide us with access to their anonymized purchase data and digital banking customers. By applying advanced analytics to this aggregation of purchase data, we make it actionable, helping marketers identify, reach and influence likely buyers at scale, and measure the true sales impact of their marketing spend.
We are a partner to FIs, including Bank of America, National Association ("Bank of America"), JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (“Chase”), PNC Bank National Association ("PNC"), Branch Banking and Trust Company ("BB&T"), SunTrust Banks, Inc. ("SunTrust"), Lloyds Bank plc ("Lloyds"), Santander UK plc ("Santander"), and several of the largest bank processors and digital banking providers to reach customers of small and mid-sized FIs. Additionally, in the third quarter of 2018, we entered into an agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (“Wells Fargo”), pursuant to which we have agreed to a national roll-out of Cardlytics Direct to Wells Fargo customers. We expect Wells Fargo to launch the Cardlytics Direct program in 2019. As the amount of revenue that we can generate from marketers with respect to Cardlytics Direct is primarily a function of the number of active users on our FI partners’ digital banking platforms, we believe that the number of monthly active users ("FI MAUs") contributed by any FI partner is indicative of our level of dependence on such FI partner. 
Our platform helps solve fundamental problems for marketers. Marketers increasingly have access to data on the purchase behavior of their customers in their own stores and websites. However, they lack insight into their customers’ purchase behavior outside of their stores and websites, as well as the purchase behavior of individuals who are not yet customers. The reality is, no matter how robust their own customer data, marketers only see a small portion of their customers’ overall spend—both within and across categories. As a result, it is very difficult for businesses to focus their marketing investments on the most valuable customers. Marketers are often challenged to measure the performance of their marketing. This issue is particularly acute with respect to measuring the impact of marketing on in-store sales, where the vast majority of consumer spending occurs. We believe purchase intelligence is the next disruptive opportunity in marketing and can comprehensively address these challenges. Our purchase intelligence platform is designed to enable marketers to identify, reach and influence likely buyers at scale, and precisely measure how marketing drives sales by “closing the loop”—both digital and in-store. We have strong relationships with leading marketers across a variety of industries, including national and regional restaurant and retail chains as well as large providers of cable, satellite television and wireless services.
We have proven the power of purchase intelligence with our proprietary native advertising channel, Cardlytics Direct. We have created a powerful, highly captive native advertising channel that reaches customers when they are thinking about their finances. By consolidating the largely untapped, high growth mobile and online banking channels of FIs, Cardlytics Direct enables marketers to reach consumers across these FIs through their digital banking accounts, which includes online, mobile and email, and increasingly through email and various real-time notifications. Using our purchase intelligence presents customers with offers to save money in these categories at a time when they are thinking of their finances.
We have experienced growth in our revenue since inception. Revenue from sales of Cardlytics Direct, which is net of Consumer Incentives, was $97.8 million, $122.4 million and $149.3 million for 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively, representing a compound annual growth rate of 16%. During 2016, 2017 and 2018, our average FI MAUs were approximately 43.9 million, 54.9 million and 65.0 million, respectively, and our average Cardlytics Direct revenue per user was $2.23, $2.23 and $2.30, respectively. FI MAU and ARPU are performance metrics defined under the heading "Non-GAAP Measures and Other Performance Metrics" within Item 7 of this Annual Report.
During 2016, 2017 and 2018, our net loss was $75.7 million, $19.6 million and $53.0 million, respectively. Our historical losses have been driven by our substantial investments in our purchase intelligence platform and infrastructure, which we believe will enable us to expand the use of our platform by both FIs and marketers. In 2016, our net loss includes a $25.9 million one-time non-cash charge related to the termination of our U.K. agreement with Aimia EMEA Limited, and a $10.9 million non-cash charge related to the issuance and change in fair value of convertible promissory notes. In 2017, our net loss includes a $5.0 million non-cash gain related to the change in fair value of convertible promissory notes. In 2018, our net loss includes $26.8 million of stock-based compensation expense, a $6.8 million non-cash expense related to the change in fair value of our warrant liabilities, a $0.9 million loss on extinguishment of debt and a $2.5 million non-cash expense related to the vesting of warrants issued to an FI partner that accelerated upon the closing of our initial public offering ("IPO").

Our Purchase Intelligence Platform
Data Asset
Purchase data from FIs provides a secure view into where and when consumers are spending their money. Our technology aggregates and analyzes purchase data without any personally identifiable information ("PII") leaving the FI. Our platform analyzes online and in-store transactions across multiple accounts in the United States ("U.S."), including two in five debit and credit card swipes in the U.S. We believe that access to this purchase data can only be obtained at scale by partnering directly with FIs. This data allows us to serve relevant advertisements to our FIs’ customers through our Cardlytics Direct native bank advertising channel. We also leverage the power of purchase intelligence to provide marketers utilizing Cardlytics Direct with valuable insights into the preferences of their actual or potential customers outside the context of a marketing campaign. 
Advanced Analytics Capabilities
The advanced analytics we apply to our unique purchase dataset are what transforms it into valuable purchase intelligence. We use sophisticated quantitative methods to quickly access our massive volumes of data and make sense of what has happened—and, importantly, what is likely to happen. Our analytics makes our data actionable, enabling us to develop insights that marketers and FIs rely on to make smarter business decisions and more meaningful customer connections.
We analyze the impact marketing campaigns have on in-store and online sales. Since we are able to measure sales impact, marketers can use our purchase intelligence to optimize future campaigns. Given our granular view into consumer spending across all categories, we can also help marketers identify share shift among key competitors, and learn more about where else their customers spend their money.
For FIs, we use our analytics to optimize the offers we display to FI customers within our Cardlytics Direct channel. By assigning relevancy scores to each offer based on what customers are most likely to buy, our platform can present the most relevant offers earlier in customers’ mobile and online banking sessions. This increases the likelihood that customers activate, redeem, and earn more cash back on the things they care about most. At the same time, marketers gain more opportunities to get valuable content in front of the right audience.
Distributed Architecture
A crucial aspect of our platform is our patented distributed architecture, which helps to facilitate both the effective delivery of our solutions and the protection of customer PII. Our Offer Placement System ("OPS"), and Offer Management System ("OMS") form the core of Cardlytics Direct and are the foundation for our other solutions.
The OPS is either hosted at the FI partner’s data center, behind the FI partner’s firewall, or hosted by us on behalf of the FI partner. The OPS tracks impressions, engagement, activation and redemptions and is responsible for targeting and presenting offers, which are developed and designed within the OMS. Each of our FI partners has its own instance of the OPS, regardless of where hosted, which consists primarily of a web application and database that interact with the FI’s web servers to deliver marketing into the FI’s online banking portal. The OPS interfaces with FI systems to receive anonymized purchase data, assigns a unique consumer ID to each FI customer, which we call a Cardlytics ID, and aggregates this purchase data. The Cardlytics ID is then used to assign offers as well as to anonymously link a consumer’s media presences, including mobile and online, to the consumer’s purchase data.
The OMS is hosted in our data centers behind our firewall and is responsible for facilitating the creation of marketing campaigns, evaluating the results of campaigns, and controlling and providing regular software updates to the deployed OPS.

Our Solutions
Cardlytics Direct
Through Cardlytics Direct, marketers can deliver advertising content to FI customers in the form of an opportunity to earn rewards, which are funded with a portion of the fees we collect from marketers. Additionally, Cardlytics Direct benefits FI customers by enhancing their experiences by showing them relevant advertisements tailored to their specific needs based on their specific purchase history. We currently sell Cardlytics Direct in the U.S. and United Kingdom ("U.K.").
Cardlytics Direct helps marketers find high potential new customers that are active in their category, but not currently shopping with them, or to grow their business with existing customers. Our marketing is targeted and measured with each individual customer’s actual spending information. However, all reporting is aggregated across consumers in our FI network. Unlike many other measurement solutions on which the marketing industry has historically relied, our measurements are not probabilistic or based on models, but are based on actual purchases.
The breadth of our FI partner network means that we are able to offer marketers the ability to optimize their marketing efforts to reach a large number of consumers through a single point of contact. Cardlytics Direct also offers our FI partners a scalable solution for driving customer loyalty and engagement with little effort on their part, as we handle everything from contracting with marketers, building, running and reporting performance of the marketing campaigns to allocating incentives to our FIs’ customers.
Other Platform Solutions
Our Other Platform Solutions enabled marketers and marketing service providers to leverage the power of purchase intelligence outside the bank channel. We have shifted the majority of our efforts and resources to support the growth of Cardlytics Direct. As a result, we do not expect to generate substantial, if any, revenue from Other Platform Solutions for the foreseeable future, and we expect Other Platform Solutions revenue to decline in future periods compared to prior periods. During 2016, 2017 and 2018, Other Platform Solutions revenue was $15.0 million, $8.0 million and $1.4 million, respectively. Accordingly, our total revenue may decline in future periods if we are unable to generate sufficient offsetting revenue from sales of Cardlytics Direct.
Competitive Strengths
We make marketing more relevant and measurable through our purchase intelligence platform. We believe that the following strengths provide us with competitive advantages:

• | Deeply Embedded with FIs. Our founders were bankers who understood the power of historical purchase data and the needs of marketers. Our platform was architected with our FI partners in mind and is designed to ensure that no PII ever leaves the FI. No FI partner with which we contract directly has unilaterally terminated its use of our platform. We are generally the exclusive provider of native bank channel advertising to our FI partners as mobile and online banking portals are not conducive to supporting marketing content from different vendors. Further, native bank channel advertising requires deep technological integrations, which we believe increases the cost of switching vendors and therefore increases FI partner loyalty to us.


• | Our Proprietary Consumer Touchpoints. With all of our FI partners, we enable marketers to reach consumers in a captive, largely untapped, and digitally engaging environment, when they are thinking about their finances. We have access to consumers both on the web and mobile, and are increasingly reaching them through various other channels, including emails and real-time notifications.


• | Massive Reach Informed by Purchase Intelligence. Our platform analyzed approximately $2.4 trillion in U.S. purchase data in 2018 across stores, retail categories, and geographies, both online and in-store, representing over 35 billion transactions across more than 175 million accounts in the U.S. We have access to purchase data on our platform is in the form of credit, debit, ACH and bill pay transactions. We provide marketers with the opportunity to leverage this unique data set to precisely reach millions of consumers.


• | Significant Scale with Marketers and Compelling ROAS. We work with companies across a variety of industries, including national and regional restaurant and retail chains as well as large providers of cable, satellite television and wireless services. By serving these marketers at scale, we have developed deep insight into consumer behavior, which has allowed us to optimize how we reach and influence likely buyers.


• | Powerful, Self-Reinforcing Network Effects. We see significant network effects within Cardlytics Direct. By adding new marketers and increasing the potential incentives provided to our FIs’ customers, we are able to increase engagement

within our FIs’ digital banking channels. This, in turn, attracts more FIs to our platform, adding to our scale, and making our platform more valuable to marketers.

• | Ability to Improve Marketing. Consumers spend a vast majority of their purchase dollars in physical stores and online marketers have long sought efficient and effective ways to understand online-to-offline attribution. Likewise, although marketers may have access to data on the purchase behavior of their customers in their stores and on their websites, they lack visibility about these customers’ overall purchasing patterns and the purchasing behavior of other likely buyers.


• | Proprietary Technology Architecture and Advanced Analytics Capabilities. We have designed our purchase intelligence platform to protect highly sensitive first-party data. Our proprietary, distributed architecture helps facilitate both the effective delivery of our solution and the protection of our FI customers’ PII. No PII is shared by the FIs with Cardlytics. Our technologies leverages proprietary algorithms, to process raw purchase data into normalized purchase history useful for marketing and analytics. Our platform also supports integration of data from our FI partners and from third-party sources to enrich the intelligence that we are able to provide. Further, we apply advanced analytics to continuously increase our intelligence capabilities and identify actionable behavior patterns for our marketers. Our advanced analytics capabilities are what transforms our unique purchase dataset into valuable purchase intelligence. We use sophisticated quantitative methods to quickly access our massive volumes of data and make sense of what has happened—and, importantly, what is likely to happen. Our analytics makes our data actionable, enabling us to develop insights that marketers and FIs rely on to make smarter business decisions and more meaningful customer connections.


• | World-Class Management Team with Unique Combination of Backgrounds and Experiences. Our team’s extensive experience across banking, technology and marketing is invaluable in our ability to forge relationships with financial and marketing partners, and understand the technical complexities inherent in building a platform that is transforming and disrupting the marketing industry.

Our Growth Strategies
The principal components of our strategy include the following:

• | Grow Our Cardlytics Direct Business with Marketers. While we already work with many large marketers, our purchase intelligence currently captures only a small portion of their overall marketing spend. We intend to continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts to grow our Cardlytics Direct business with existing marketers and attract new brands, retailers and service providers both. We also intend to grow our Cardlytics Direct business with new marketers in new industry verticals such as e-commerce/direct-to-consumer, grocery, travel, and entertainment verticals.


• | Drive Growth through Existing FI Partners. We intend to drive revenue growth by continuing to increase customer adoption and improve the effectiveness of FIs’ digital channels. The revenue that we generate from the incentive programs of each of our FI partners varies. This variance is typically a result of how long the program has been active, the user interface for the program and the FI’s efforts to promote the program. We continually work with FIs to improve their customers’ user experience, increase customer awareness, and leverage additional customer outreach channels like email.


• | Expand our Network of FI Partners. We will continue to focus on growing our network of FI partners by integrating directly with large regional and national banks and by reselling our solution through financial processors and payment networks. Each new FI partner increases the size of our data asset, increasing the value of our platform to both marketers and FIs that are already part of our FI network.


• | Grow Our Platform Through Integrations with Partners. We believe that we can improve the value proposition for marketers through the use of purchase intelligence. We intend to continue to partner with other media platforms, marketing technology providers and agencies that can utilize our platform to serve a broad array of customers. To facilitate these partnerships, we intend to focus on continued technological integration of our platform with those of complementary market participants.


• | Continue to Innovate and Evolve Our Platform. As we continue to grow our data asset and enhance our platform, we are developing new solutions and increasingly sophisticated analytical capabilities. As we have in the past, we plan to continue to work in close collaboration with our FI partners to develop new purchase intelligence based analytic solutions for marketing and other industries that satisfy the demanding requirements of financial services.

Our FI Partners
We partner with FIs to offer incentive programs through their digital banking channels. We define an FI partner as either a separate contracting entity from which we generate revenue directly or from which we generate revenue through a third-party intermediary, such as a bank processor, digital banking provider or payment network operator. We pay our FI partners an FI Share, which is a negotiated and fixed percentage of our billings to marketers less any Consumer Incentives that we pay to the FIs’ customers and certain third-party data costs.
Chase launched the Cardlytics Direct program for mobile banking in November 2018. As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2018, our average FI MAUs were 83.2 million of which Chase contributed 27%. Chase expanded the program to their email channel in January 2019 and we expect Chase to further expand the program to online banking during the first half of 2019.
During 2016, 2017, 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2018, our largest FI partner, Bank of America contributed 47%, 51%, 47% and 37% of our average FI MAUs, respectively. Lloyds, our largest FI partner in the U.K., contributed 10%, 9%, 8% and 6% of our average FI MAUs in 2016, 2017, 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, we had direct contractual relationships with 21 of our FI partners, while our other FI partners became part of our network through bank processors and digital banking providers, such as Digital Insight Corporation, a subsidiary of NCR Corporation ("Digital Insight"). Digital Insight contributed 13%, 11%, 10% and 8% of our average FI MAUs in 2016, 2017, 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2018, respectively. PNC contributed 10%, 8%, 10% and 8% of our average FI MAUs in 2016, 2017, 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2018, respectively. Further, while FI partners that were part of our network through our relationships with Digital Insight contributed 10% of our average FI MAUs in 2018, these indirect FI partners represented substantially all of our total number of FI partners as of December 31, 2018.
From inception to date, no FI partner with which we contract directly has unilaterally terminated its use of our solution. FIs that become part of our network through bank processors and digital banking providers may terminate their relationships with these bank processors and digital banking providers and thereby indirectly terminate their relationships with us.
Our Agreements with Bank of America
Since November 2010, our relationship with Bank of America has been governed by a General Services Agreement ("GSA") pursuant to which we provide Bank of America with access to Cardlytics Direct and certain other related services, and a related Software License, Customization and Maintenance Agreement, which grants Bank of America the right to use the software underlying Cardlytics Direct. The GSA terminates on November 4, 2021 and may be extended by Bank of America for additional one-year periods. 
Pursuant to the GSA with Bank of America, we provide Cardlytics Direct to Bank of America customers which includes forming relationships with participating marketers; obtaining and publishing marketer offers to customers after screening both the marketer and specific advertising content; and monitoring redemption rates with respect to Consumer Incentives offered in Cardlytics Direct campaigns. Although we are primarily responsible for securing marketers to advertise on Cardlytics Direct, Bank of America may likewise secure marketers and has the right to approve all marketer offers to be presented to Bank of America customers on Cardlytics Direct.
Under the GSA, we share the revenue that we generate from the sale of advertising within the Bank of America Cardlytics Direct channel with Bank of America, subject to certain exceptions. The amounts that we pay to Bank of America are reflected as FI Share. During 2016, 2017, 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2018, Bank of America accounted for 64%, 63%, 64% and 52% of our aggregate FI Share, respectively. The specific FI Share percentage that we pay is based on whether we or Bank of America have secured the relevant marketer account and other marketer- and transaction-specific factors, provided that we are entitled to retain a minimum percentage of the monthly revenue subject to the GSA.
In connection with entering into certain supplements to the GSA and the related license agreement, in March 2011 we granted to an affiliate of Bank of America a 10-year warrant to purchase up to (i) 78,101 shares of our common stock at an exercise prices of $2.52 per share and (ii) 312,402 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $6.52 per share.
Our Agreements with Chase
In May 2018, we entered into a Master Agreement and Schedule #1 to the Master Agreement (collectively, the “Master Agreement”) with Chase, pursuant to which we rolled out Cardlytics Direct to Chase customers. Under the Master Agreement, we provided Chase with access to Cardlytics Direct for an initial term beginning on the date Cardlytics Direct was made generally available to Chase's customers and ending seven years from that date. Chase may terminate the Master Agreement at any time upon 90 days’ written notice.

Under the Master Agreement, we share billings that we generate from the sale of advertising within the Chase Cardlytics Direct channel with Chase, subject to certain exceptions. The amounts that we pay to Chase in excess of Consumer Incentives are reflected as FI Share. The specific billing share percentage that we pay is based on whether we or Chase have secured the relevant marketer account and other marketer- and transaction-specific factors, provided that we are entitled to retain a minimum percentage of the monthly revenue subject to the Master Agreement. 
Chase launched the Cardlytics Direct program for mobile banking in November 2018 and accounted for 16% of our aggregate FI Share during the fourth quarter of 2018.
Our Marketers
We enable marketers and their agencies to efficiently and effectively market to our FIs’ customers through Cardlytics Direct. We work with companies across a variety of industries, including national and regional restaurants, retail, cable and satellite television providers and wireless carriers, e-commerce/direct-to-consumer, grocery, travel, and entertainment. Our top five marketers represented 23% of revenue during 2016, 2017 and 2018. During 2016, 2017 and 2018, no marketer individually represented 10% or more of our revenue.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales teams are focused on expanding our FI network as well as our marketer and agency customers. Our marketing team is centralized and focuses on increasing market awareness for Cardlytics through partnerships, public relations, industry events and publications. During 2016, 2017 and 2018, our total sales and marketing expenses were $31.3 million, $31.9 million and $41.9 million, respectively, representing approximately 28%, 24% and 28% of revenue, respectively.
Marketers
We have dedicated sales teams responsible for establishing relationships with marketers and their agencies. Our go-to-market efforts are organized by industry vertical, which include restaurants, retail, cable and satellite television providers and wireless carriers, e-commerce/direct-to-consumer, grocery, travel, and entertainment. Each vertical team is led by an experienced sales manager and staffed with sales, sales support and service specialists who have deep domain knowledge and industry operating experience. We also have account managers that manage our customer relationships within each vertical.
Financial Institution Partners
Our go-to-market efforts for expanding our FI network are focused on nurturing our existing banking relationships and cultivating new relationships. From inception to date, no FI partner with which we contract directly has unilaterally terminated its use of our solution. Our FI partner sales team is focused on driving FIs to enhance their user interface for our white label program, otherwise drive increased consumer engagement and encourage adoption of our solution offerings.
Our Competition
The market for the utilization of purchase intelligence is nascent and we believe we are one of the only companies that can provide purchase intelligence with the scale and the level of granularity that is equivalent to ours. With respect to Cardlytics Direct, we believe that we are the only company that enables marketing through FI channels at scale. As we expand our solutions, we expect to compete with a number of established companies, as well as numerous emerging market entrants. In the future, we may face competition from online retailers, credit card companies, digital publishers and mobile pay providers with access to a substantial amount of consumer purchase data. While we may successfully partner with a wide range of companies that are to some extent currently competitive to us, these companies may become more competitive to us in the future. As we introduce new solutions, as our existing solutions evolve and as other companies introduce new products and services, we are likely to face additional competition.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our industry include the following:

• | ability to leverage purchase data to inform marketing;


• | depth and breadth of relationships with FIs, marketers and their agencies;


• | demonstrating the need for purchase intelligence to inform marketing spend;


• | depth and breadth of, and access to, purchase data;


• | effectiveness in increasing return on advertising spend for marketers;


• | effectiveness in increasing marketing campaign performance for marketers and their agencies;

8


• | ability to maintain confidentiality and security of consumer data;


• | transparency into and measurement of marketing performance;


• | multi-channel capabilities;


• | pricing;


• | brand awareness and reputation;


• | ability to continue to innovate; and


• | ability to attract, retain and develop leading-edge analytical and technical talent.

We believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors and that we are well positioned as a leading provider and innovator of purchase intelligence.
Intellectual Property
Our future success and competitive position depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technologies. To safeguard these rights, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and contractual protections in the U.S. and other jurisdictions.
As of December 31, 2018, we had four issued patents and are pursuing five additional patents relating to our software. Our issued patents relate to a distributed system for inserting offers into online banking and expire on October 24, 2028. We cannot assure you that any patents will issue from any patent applications, that patents that issue from such applications will give us the protection that we seek or that any such patents will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented. Any patents that may issue in the future from our pending or future patent applications may not provide sufficiently broad protection and may not be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers.
We have registered the “Cardlytics” name and logo in the U.S. and certain other countries. We have registrations and/or pending applications for additional marks in the U.S. and other countries; however, we cannot assure you that any future trademark registrations will be issued for pending or future applications or that any registered trademarks will be enforceable or provide adequate protection of our proprietary rights.
We also license software from third parties for integration into our offerings, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms. We cannot assure you that such third parties will maintain such software or continue to make it available.
We are the registered holder of a variety of domestic and international domain names that include cardlytics.com and similar variations on that name.
In order to protect our unpatented proprietary technologies and processes, we rely on trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, financial institution partners, marketers, vendors and others. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and trade secrets, unauthorized parties may attempt to misappropriate, reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use them. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets, in which case we would not be able to assert trade secret rights, or develop similar technologies and processes. Further, the contractual provisions that we enter into may not prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary technology or intellectual property rights and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary technology or intellectual property rights. If we become more successful, we believe that competitors will be more likely to try to develop solutions and services that are similar to ours and that may infringe our proprietary rights. It may also be more likely that competitors or other third parties will claim that our platform infringes their proprietary rights.
Patent and other intellectual property disputes are common in our industry and we have been involved in such disputes from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Some companies, including some of our competitors, own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks, which they may use to assert claims against us. Third parties may in the future assert claims of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights against us. They may also assert such claims against our FI partners, which we typically indemnify against such claims. As the numbers of products and competitors in our market increase and overlaps occur, claims of infringement, misappropriation and other violations of intellectual property rights may increase. Any claim of infringement, misappropriation or other violation of intellectual property rights by a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim and could distract our management from our business.

Privacy and Security
We have architected privacy and security into our systems and practices. A critical part of our strategy involves not collecting, maintaining or using sensitive information, such as social security numbers, credit card numbers, financial account information or medical records. We currently do not receive any PII from our FI partners. We only receive data in aggregate and target marketing against anonymized data. This approach to privacy is intended to protect consumers. Our privacy and security standards have also been designed and implemented to meet the requirements and safeguard the reputations of our FI partners and marketers, many of which are large, multinational corporations. These customers frequently audit our practices and engage in detailed assessments of our infrastructure.
Despite the fact that we do not receive any PII from FIs, privacy and security are among our highest priorities and we commit significant resources to protecting the data that we receive. We have implemented, assess on an ongoing basis, and, when necessary, upgrade our physical, procedural and technical controls. We also take steps to impose compliance with these controls on our service providers via contract.
We have implemented a number of security controls. Our security controls have been audited and certified by third parties using standards which include SOC 1, SOC 2 and OWASP. Sensitive data is subject to encryption, anonymization, or de-identification depending on the use case and risk profile. We enhance network security through measures such as network segmentation, firewalls and network and host based intrusion detection at critical network aggregation and ingress/egress points.
A cornerstone of our practices is transparency in data use and consumer choice. Our privacy policy outlines the types of data we collect and how we use it. Most of our FI partners maintain different types of "opt-out” features for any consumer wishing to opt out of Cardlytics Direct.
Outside of the U.S., our privacy and data handling practices are subject to regulation by data protection authorities and other regulators in the countries in which we do business, which may be more restrictive than the requirements that we are subject to in the U.S.
Seasonality
Our cash flows from operations vary from quarter to quarter, largely due to the seasonal nature of our marketers’ advertising spending. Many marketers tend to devote a significant portion of their marketing budgets to the fourth quarter of the calendar year to coincide with consumer holiday spending and to reduce spend in the first quarter of the calendar year.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 402 full-time employees, including 91 in delivery, 186 in sales and marketing, 77 in research and development and 48 in general and administrative. None of our U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe our employee relations are good and we have not experienced any work stoppages.
