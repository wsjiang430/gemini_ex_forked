ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 Seritage Growth Properties (“Seritage”) (NYSE: SRG), a Maryland real estate investment trust formed on June 3, 2015, is a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust (“REIT”) as defined under Section 856(c) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”).  Seritage’s assets are held by and its operations are primarily conducted through, directly or indirectly, Seritage Growth Properties, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”).  Under the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership, Seritage, as the sole general partner, has exclusive responsibility and discretion in the management and control of the Operating Partnership.  Unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, the “Company”, “we,” “us,” and “our” as used herein refer to Seritage, the Operating Partnership and its owned and controlled subsidiaries.
 Seritage is principally engaged in the acquisition, ownership, development, redevelopment, management and leasing of diversified retail real estate throughout the United States.  As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio consisted of approximately 36.3 million square feet of gross leasable area (“GLA”), including 206 wholly owned properties totaling approximately 31.6 million square feet of GLA across 48 states and Puerto Rico (the “Wholly Owned Properties), and interests in 26 joint venture properties totaling over 4.7 million square feet of GLA across 13 states (the “JV Properties”).
 On June 11, 2015, Sears Holdings Corporation (“Sears Holdings” or “Sears”) effected a rights offering (the “Rights Offering”) to Sears Holdings stockholders to purchase common shares of Seritage in order to fund, in part, the $2.7 billion acquisition of (i) 234 of Sears Holdings’ owned properties and one of its ground leased properties, and (ii) its 50% interests in three joint ventures that collectively owned 28 properties, ground leased one property and leased two properties (the “Transaction”).  The Rights Offering ended on July 2, 2015, and the Company’s Class A common shares were listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) on July 6, 2015.
 On July 7, 2015, the Company completed the Transaction with Sears Holdings and commenced operations.  The Company did not have any operations prior to the completion of the Rights Offering and Transaction.
 As of December 31, 2018, we leased space at 86 Wholly Owned Properties to Sears Holdings pursuant to a master lease agreement (the “Master Lease”) that provided the Company with the right to recapture certain space from Sears Holdings at each property for retenanting or redevelopment purposes.  Of these properties, 49 properties were leased only to Sears Holdings and 37 properties are leased to both Sears Holdings and one or more diversified, non-Sears tenants as of December 31, 2018.  The remaining 120 Wholly Owned Properties included 89 properties that are leased solely to diversified, non-Sears tenants and 31 unleased properties.  As of December 31, 2018, space at 19 JV Properties was also leased to Sears Holdings pursuant to lease agreements similar to the Master Lease (the “JV Master Leases”).  As of December 31, 2018, Sears Holdings was the sole tenant at seven JV Properties and 12 JV properties are leased to both Sears Holdings and one or more diversified, non-Sears tenants.  Five JV Properties were leased solely to diversified, non-Sears tenants and two JV Properties were unleased as of December 31, 2018.
 As of December 31, 2018, there were four Wholly Owned Properties subject to previously exercised 100% recapture notices and five Wholly Owned Properties under contract for sale.  Taking into account this recapture and transaction activity, we leased space at 77 Wholly Owned Properties and 19 JV Properties to Sears Holdings under the Master Lease and JV Master Leases, respectively, as of December 31, 2018.
 On October 15, 2018, Sears Holdings and certain of its affiliates filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the “Bankruptcy Court”).  On February 11, 2019, Transform Holdco LLC (“Holdco”), an affiliate of ESL Investments, Inc., completed the acquisition of an approximately 425-store retail footprint and other assets and component businesses of Sears Holdings on a going-concern basis (the “Holdco Acquisition”).  In connection with the Holdco Acquisition, Holdco acquired certain designation rights (which rights must be exercised by April 12, 2019) with respect to certain executory contracts and leases of Sears Holdings, including our Master Lease with Sears Holdings. On February 28, 2019, we and certain affiliates of Holdco executed a master lease with respect to 51 Wholly Owned Properties (the “Holdco Master Lease”).  A condition to the performance and obligations provided for in the Holdco Master Lease is the rejection of the Master Lease.  On February 28, 2019, Sears Holdings filed a notice with the Bankruptcy Court seeking an order of the Bankruptcy Court approving the rejection of the Master Lease.  The rejection will become effective by either (i) the Bankruptcy Court issues an order approving the rejection of the Master Lease or (ii) the Master Lease is deemed to be rejected pursuant to the operation of the Bankruptcy Code.  As a result of this condition there can be no assurance as to the commencement of our and Holdco’s performance and obligations provided for in the Holdco Master Lease and/or the timing thereof.
 Edward S. Lampert is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of ESL Investments, Inc.  Mr. Lampert is also the Chairman of Seritage and the Chairman of the Board of each of the tenant entities that is a party to the Holdco Master Lease.

Business Strategies
 Our primary objective is to create value for our shareholders through the re-leasing and redevelopment of the majority of our Wholly Owned Properties and JV Properties.  In doing so, we expect to meaningfully grow net operating income (“NOI”) by re-leasing existing space to diversified, non-Sears tenants at materially higher rents and densifying select sites with additional retail and mixed-use development.  In order to achieve our objective, we intend to execute the following strategies:

• | Convert single-tenant buildings into multi-tenant properties at meaningfully higher rents. We intend to increase NOI and diversify our portfolio by actively redeveloping space at our properties and re-leasing such space to new, diversified tenants at higher rents than those currently or formerly paid for space occupied by Sears and Kmart prior to redevelopment. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We seek to optimize the mix of tenants at, and maximize the value of, our properties by focusing on growing national retailers and taking into account customer demographics and the competitive environment of each property's market area.  We believe that the superior real estate locations, diversity of property types and national footprint that characterize our portfolio, make us well-positioned to meet the store growth needs of retailers across a variety of sectors and concepts.  As we lease space to such retailers, we aim to create multi-tenant shopping centers that command superior rents and valuations due to their prime locations, synergies with adjoining retailers and proximity to productive malls and shopping centers.
  
• | Maximize value of vast land holdings through retail and mixed-use densification. As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio included approximately 3,000 acres of land, or an average of 13 acres per site, and our most significant geographic concentrations were in higher growth markets in California, Florida, Texas and the Northeast. We believe these land holdings will provide meaningful opportunities for additional retail and mixed-use development. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In particular, we have identified approximately three dozen sites that we believe have the real estate characteristics and demographic profile to support integrated mixed-use development, including retail, residential, office and other uses.  Given our fee ownership of these properties and control over parking lots and outparcels, we believe that these sites, as well as others throughout the portfolio, will provide attractive and value-enhancing redevelopment opportunities.  In 2018, the Company solidified a portion of its mixed-used and densification pipeline by receiving entitlements for 1,750 residential units, 1.4 million square feet of office space and 500 hotel keys across four unique projects.
  
• | Leverage existing and future joint venture relationships with leading real estate and financial partners. As of December 31, 2018, we owned 50% interests in 26 JV Properties, including three joint ventures with institutional capital partners and 23 joint ventures with leading regional mall REITs, each of which is focused on driving value creation at the JV Properties through the same intensive re-leasing and redevelopment activities we pursue at our Wholly Owned Properties. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We expect to participate in future joint ventures to leverage our human and capital resources and pursue additional value-creating projects.  We will generally seek partners that provide incremental development expertise and/or capital, or, as a result of circumstances, allow us to create more value together than we believe we could create on our own.
  
• | Maintain a flexible capital structure to support value creation activities. We expect to maintain a capital structure that provides us with the financial flexibility and capacity to fund our redevelopment opportunities. We believe that our current capital structure, specifically the $2.0 billion term loan facility we entered into in 2018, positions us with sufficient liquidity and flexibility to execute our redevelopment business strategy. We believe that we will continue to have access to additional forms of capital to fund value-creating projects, including through the public or private issuance of certain equity and debt securities and, subject to compliance with certain provisions or the consent of our lender under the $2.0 billion term loan facility, the ability to raise capital through asset sales and additional joint ventures.

Significant Tenants
 As of December 31, 2018, a significant number of our real estate properties were leased to Sears Holdings, and a significant amount of our in-place rental revenues were derived from the Master Lease.  On February 28, 2019, we and certain affiliates of Holdco executed the Holdco Master Lease.  A condition to the performance and obligations provided for in the Holdco Master Lease is the rejection of the Master Lease.  On February 28, 2019, Sears Holdings filed a notice with the Bankruptcy Court seeking an order of the Bankruptcy Court approving the rejection of the Master Lease.  The rejection will become effective by either (i) the Bankruptcy Court issues an order approving the rejection of the Master Lease or (ii) the Master Lease is deemed to be rejected pursuant to the operation of the Bankruptcy Code.  As a result of this condition there can be no assurance as to the commencement of our and Holdco’s performance and obligations provided for in the Holdco Master Lease and/or the timing thereof.  A material amount of our rental income is expected to be derived from the Holdco Master Lease until we further diversify the tenancy of our portfolio.  See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Operations.”

The Holdco Master Lease contains provisions that can help facilitate the diversification of our tenant base. The Holdco Master Lease provides us with the right to recapture up to approximately 50% of the space occupied by Holdco at all properties (other than five specified properties in Puerto Rico and California). Additionally, beginning in the second year of the term of the Holdco Master Lease, we have the right to recapture 100% of the space occupied by Holdco at any of the properties included in the Holdco Master Lease (other than five specified properties located in Puerto Rico and California) without making a recapture payment to Holdco.  The right to recapture 100% of any property is limited to 10 properties in each year of the Holdco Master Lease term, with carry-over rights if less than 10 properties are recaptured in any year of the Holdco Master Lease term.  Holdco has the right, at any time, to terminate the Holdco Master Lease with respect to any property upon the payment of a termination fee equal to one year of base rent plus annual taxes and other operating expenses, without the requirement that such property is EBITDA negative as is required under the Master Lease.  Additionally, unlike the Master Lease, beginning in the second year of the term of the Holdco Master Lease, Holdco has the right to terminate without payment of a termination fee: (i) up to 16 properties in the second year of the Holdco Master Lease term, (ii) up to 12 properties in the third year of the Holdco Master Lease term, (iii) up to 10 properties in the fourth year of the Holdco Master Lease term, and (iv) thereafter, the remaining properties, in each instance with carry-over rights if less than the maximum permitted number of properties are terminated in any lease year.  
 As of December 31, 2018, a substantial majority of the space at the JV Properties was leased to Sears Holdings under the JV Master Leases. As of the date hereof, none of the existing JV Master Leases have been assumed or rejected.  There can be no assurance that any such leases will not be assumed or rejected, or that Sears Holdings will continue to perform its obligations under the existing JV Master Leases to which it is a party.
 Competition
 We compete for investment opportunities and prospective tenants with other REITs, real estate partnerships and other real estate companies, private individuals, investment companies, private equity and hedge fund investors, sovereign funds, pension funds, insurance companies, lenders and other investors, including retailer operators that may close stores and pursue similar real estate strategies.  In addition, revenues from our properties are dependent on the ability of our tenants and operators to compete with other retail operators.
 Some of our competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we have.  Increased competition will make it more challenging to identify and successfully capitalize on investment opportunities that meet our objectives.  Our ability to compete is also impacted by national and local economic trends, availability of investment alternatives, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, existing laws and regulations, new legislation and population trends.
 As a landlord, we compete in the real estate market with numerous developers and owners of properties, including the shopping centers in which our properties are located.  Some of our competitors have greater economies of scale, relationships with national tenants at multiple properties which are owned or operated by such competitors, access to more resources and greater name recognition than we do.  If our competitors offer space at rental rates below the current market rates or below the rentals we currently charge, or on terms and conditions which include locations at multiple properties, we may lose our existing and/or potential tenants and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates or to offer substantial rent abatements, tenant improvement allowances, early termination rights or below-market renewal options in order to win new tenants and retain tenants when our leases expire.
 Environmental Matters
 Our properties are subject to environmental laws regulating, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges and the handling and disposal of wastes.  Certain of the properties were built during the time that asbestos-containing building materials were routinely installed in residential and commercial structures.  In addition, a substantial portion of the properties we acquired from Sears Holdings currently include, or previously included, automotive care center facilities and retail fueling facilities, and are or were subject to laws and regulations governing the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances contained in some of the products or materials used or sold in the automotive care center facilities (such as motor oil, fluid in hydraulic lifts, antifreeze and solvents and lubricants), the recycling/disposal of batteries and tires, air emissions, wastewater discharges and waste management.  In addition to these products or materials, the equipment in use or previously used at such properties, such as service equipment, car lifts, oil/water separators, and storage tanks, has been subject to increasing environmental regulation relating to, among other things, the storage, handling, use, disposal, and transportation of hazardous materials.  The Master Lease obligated Sears Holdings to comply with applicable environmental laws and to indemnify us if their noncompliance results in losses or claims against us, and to remove all automotive care center equipment and facilities upon the expiration or sooner termination of the Master Lease. The Holdco Master Lease contains, and we expect other leases to include, similar provisions for other operators of their respective spaces with respect to environmental matters first arising during their occupancy.  An operator’s failure to comply could result in fines and penalties or the requirement to undertake corrective actions which may result in significant costs to the operator and thus adversely affect their ability to meet their obligations to us.

Pursuant to U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be required to investigate, remove and/or remediate a release of hazardous substances or other regulated materials at, or emanating from, such property.  Further, under certain circumstances, such owners or operators of real property may be held liable for property damage, personal injury and/or natural resource damage resulting from or arising in connection with such releases.  Certain of these laws have been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of responsibility.  We also may be liable under certain of these laws for damage that occurred prior to our ownership of a property or at a site where we sent wastes for disposal.  The failure to properly remediate a property may also adversely affect our ability to lease, sell or rent the property or to borrow funds using the property as collateral.
 Under the Master Lease, Sears Holdings is required to indemnify us from certain environmental liabilities at the Wholly Owned Properties before or during the period in which each Wholly Owned Property is leased to Sears Holdings, including removal and remediation of all affected facilities and equipment constituting the automotive care center facilities (and each JV Master Lease to which Sears Holdings is a party includes a similar requirement of Sears Holdings).  In addition, an environmental reserve was funded at the closing of the Transaction in the amount of approximately $12.0 million.  As of December 31, 2018, the balance of the environmental reserve was approximately $9.5 million. 
 In connection with the ownership of our current or past properties and any properties that we may acquire in the future, we could be legally responsible for environmental liabilities or costs relating to a release of hazardous substances or other regulated materials at or emanating from such property.  We are not aware of any environmental issues that are expected to have a material impact on the operations of our properties.
 Insurance
 We have comprehensive liability, property and rental loss insurance with respect to our portfolio of properties. We believe that such insurance provides adequate coverage.
 REIT Qualification
 We elected to be treated as a REIT commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2015 and expect to continue to operate so as to qualify as a REIT.  So long as we qualify as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on net taxable income that we distribute annually to our shareholders.  In order to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, including, but not limited to, the real estate qualification of sources of our income, the composition and values of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our shareholders and the diversity of ownership of our stock.  In order to comply with REIT requirements, we may need to forego otherwise attractive opportunities and limit our expansion opportunities and the manner in which we conduct our operations.  See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Status as a REIT.”
Financial Information about Industry Segments
 We currently operate in a single reportable segment, which includes the acquisition, ownership, development, redevelopment, management and leasing of retail properties.  We review operating and financial results for each property on an individual basis and do not distinguish or group our properties based on geography, size, or type.  We, therefore, aggregate all of our properties into one reportable segment due to their similarities with regard to the nature and economics of the properties, tenants and operational process.
Employees
 As of February 22, 2019, we had 69 full-time employees.  Our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our employee relations to be satisfactory.
