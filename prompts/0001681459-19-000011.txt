History
In March 2015, FMC Technologies, Inc., a U.S. Delaware corporation (“FMC Technologies”), and Technip S.A., a French société anonyme (“Technip”), signed an agreement to form an exclusive alliance and to launch Forsys Subsea, a 50/50 joint venture, that would unite the skills and capabilities of two subsea industry leaders. This alliance, which became operational on June 1, 2015, was established to identify new and innovative approaches to the design, delivery, and maintenance of subsea fields.
Forsys Subsea brought the industry's most talented subsea professionals together early in operators’ project concept phase with the technical capabilities to design and integrate products, systems and installation to significantly reduce the cost of subsea field development and enhance overall project economics.
Based on the success of the Forsys joint venture and its innovative approach to integrate solutions, Technip and FMC Technologies announced in May 2016 that the companies would combine through a merger of equals to create a global leader, TechnipFMC, that would drive change by redefining the production and transformation of oil and gas. The business combination was completed on January 16, 2017 (the “Merger”), and on January 17, 2017, TechnipFMC began operating as a unified, combined company trading on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) and on the Euronext Paris Stock Exchange (“Euronext Paris”) under the symbol “FTI.”

In 2017, our first year as a merged company, TechnipFMC secured several project awards as many operators moved forward with final investment decisions for major onshore projects and subsea developments. Several of the subsea awards incorporated the use of our integrated approach to project delivery, validating our unique business model aimed at lowering project costs and accelerating the delivery of initial hydrocarbon production. This approach was made possible by bringing together the complimentary work scopes of the merged companies. With the industry’s most comprehensive and only truly integrated market offering, we have continued to expand the deepwater opportunity set for our customers. TechnipFMC’s expertise does not end with the production of hydrocarbons. Because of its best in class project design and execution capabilities, enabled by a portfolio of proprietary technologies, TechnipFMC continues to secure and deliver projects that further enable our clients to monetize resources - from liquefaction of gas, both onshore and on floating vessels, through refining and product facilities.
The Company continues to innovate and introduce new technologies across our portfolio of products and services. TechnipFMC also delivered strong financial performance in 2018, driven by a relentless focus on operational execution and cost reduction activities.
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
Subsea
The Subsea segment provides integrated design, engineering, procurement, manufacturing, fabrication and installation, and life of field services for subsea systems, subsea field infrastructure, and subsea pipe systems used in oil and gas production and transportation.
We are an industry leader in front-end engineering and design (“FEED”), subsea production systems (“SPS”), flexible pipe, and subsea umbilicals, risers, and flowlines (“SURF”). We also have the capability to install these products and related subsea infrastructure with our fleet of highly specialized vessels. By driving even greater value through integrating the SPS and SURF work scopes and more efficiently execute the installation campaign, our strong commercial focus has enabled the successful market introduction of an integrated subsea business model, iEPCI™ (“iEPCI”), which spans a project’s early phase design the life of field. Our integrated model business model is unlocking incremental opportunities and materially expanding the deepwater opportunity set.
Through integrated FEED studies, or iFEED™ (“iFEED”), we are uniquely positioned to influence project concept and design. Using innovative solutions for field architecture, including standardized equipment, new technologies, and simplified installation, we can significantly reduce subsea development costs and accelerate time to first production. 
Our first-mover advantage and ability to convert iFEED studies into iEPCI contracts, often as a direct award, creates a unique set of opportunities for the Company that are not available to our peers. This allows us to deliver a fully integrated - and technologically differentiated - subsea system, and to better manage the complete work scope through a single contracting mechanism and single interface, yielding great improvements in project economics and time to first oil.
Our Subsea business depends on our ability to maintain a cost-effective and efficient production system, achieve planned equipment production targets, successfully develop new products, and meet or exceed stringent performance and reliability standards.
Principal Products and Services
Subsea Production Systems. Our systems are used in the offshore production of crude oil and natural gas. Subsea systems are placed on the seafloor and are used to control the flow of crude oil and natural gas from the reservoir to a host processing facility, such as a floating production facility, a fixed platform, or an onshore facility.
Our subsea production systems and products include subsea trees, chokes and flow modules, manifold pipeline systems, control and data management systems, well access systems, multiphase and wetgas meters, and additional technologies. The design and manufacture of our subsea systems requires a high degree of technical expertise and innovation. Some of our systems are designed to withstand exposure to the extreme hydrostatic pressure of deepwater environments, as well as internal pressures of up to 20,000 pounds per square inch (“psi”) and temperatures of up to 400º F. The development of our integrated subsea production systems includes initial engineering design studies and field development planning to consider all relevant aspects and project requirements, including optimization of drilling programs and subsea architecture.
5

Our subsea processing systems, which include subsea boosting, subsea gas compression, and subsea separation, are designed to accelerate production, increase recovery, extend field life, and/or lower operators’ production costs. To provide these products, systems and services, we utilize our engineering, project management, procurement, manufacturing, and assembly and test capabilities.
Flexible Pipe and Umbilical Supply. We perform the engineering and manufacturing of flexible pipes, relying on our engineering centers, and the thermoplastic, steel tube, hybrid (a combination of steel tube, thermoplastic hose, and electrical cables), and power cable umbilical manufacturing units across various regions. In other markets, TechnipFMC vessels will typically perform the installation of the flexible pipes and umbilicals but we will also provide these products to other vessels.
We use our engineering and technical expertise to respond to tenders from a variety of clients including oil companies, engineering, procurement, construction, and installation services (“EPCI”) contractors and other subsea production system manufacturers, often as part of a broader scope. 
Vessels. We operate a fleet of 18 vessels, with one additional vessel under construction. Of the 18 vessels currently in operation, we have sole ownership of eight vessels, ownership of seven vessels as part of joint ventures and operate three vessels under long-term charter.
We wholly own five pipelay support vessels and jointly own eight subsea construction vessels, including one under construction. The jointly-owned vessels operate under a 50/50 ownership structure exclusively in the Brazilian market. These vessels are primarily contracted to Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. - Petrobras (“Petrobras”), principally to install umbilical and flexible flowlines and risers to connect subsea wells to floating production units across a range of water depths. We also own one subsea construction and pipelay vessel mostly dedicated to the Asia Pacific market and have long-term charter agreements for three further construction vessels. The Company also owns two dive support vessels.
Subsea Services. We provide an array of subsea services to improve uptime, lower lifecycle costs and increase recovery over the life of the field for our clients’ subsea production systems. These services include: (i) provision of exploration and production well head systems; (ii) installation and well completion; (iii) asset management services for test, maintenance, refurbishment, and upgrade of subsea equipment and tooling; (iv) field performance services based on product data and field data to optimize the performance of the subsea production system; (v) inspection, maintenance, and repair (“IMR”) of subsea infrastructure; (vi) well access and intervention services, both rig-based and vessel-based (riserless light well intervention or “RLWI”), to enhance well production; (vii) remotely operated vehicle (“ROV”) services; and (viii) well plug and abandonment and decommissioning.
Key drivers of subsea services market activity are the inspection and maintenance of subsea infrastructure, driven in large part by aging infrastructure on mature fields. The need for well intervention services also continues to grow, with more than 6,000 wells operated globally, of which 33% are older than 10 years and 65% are older than five years.
With our extensive experience in subsea equipment, our large installed base of subsea production equipment, our broad range of services, and our historical technical leadership, we are in a unique position to offer integrated solutions through “life of field” services combining asset light solutions (e.g., RLWI), digital services (e.g., Condition Performance Monitoring / Flow Manager suite of applications), and leading edge automated systems (e.g., Schilling ROVs, In-service Riser Inspection System or “IRIS”) to enhance the economics of producing fields through maximization of asset uptime, higher production volumes and lower operating expense.
Robotics, Controls and Automation. We design and manufacture ROVs and manipulator arms that are used in subsea drilling, construction, IMR, and life of field services. Our product offering includes electric and hydraulic work-class ROVs, tether-management systems, launch and recovery systems, remote manipulator arms, and modular control systems . We also provide support and services such as product training, pilot simulator training, spare parts, and technical assistance.
We also provide electro-hydraulic and electric production and intervention control systems, allowing accurate control and monitoring of subsea installations to ensure the highest production availability while providing safe and environmentally friendly field operations. These include the sensors, multiphase flow meters, digital infrastructure, integrity monitoring, control functionality, and automation features needed for subsea systems. Robotics capabilities are now being used in the control of manifold valves during production. This is a convergence of our technologies in order to provide better systems for our customers.
6

Engineering, Manufacturing and Supply Chain (“EMS”) is a new organization we formed in November 2017 to help achieve productivity improvements by reducing the cost of engineering and manufacturing our products, including working with our suppliers to reduce their costs, and optimizing our processes and how we manage workflow. Through EMS, we are focused on implementing world-class manufacturing practices, including lean flow and automation, to improve reliability while reducing total product cost and lead time to delivery. Our EMS organization primarily supports our subsea segment but is also integrated across our business.
Capital Intensity
Many of the systems and products we supply for subsea applications are highly engineered to meet the unique demands of our customers’ field properties and are typically ordered one to two years prior to installation. We often receive advance payments and progress billings from our customers to fund initial development and working capital requirements. However, our working capital balances can vary significantly depending on the payment terms and execution timing on contracts.
Dependence on Key Customers
Generally, our customers in this segment are major integrated oil companies, national oil companies, and independent exploration and production companies.
We actively pursue alliances with companies that are engaged in the subsea development of oil and natural gas to promote our integrated systems for subsea production. These alliances are typically related to the procurement of subsea production equipment, although some alliances are related to EPCI services. Development of subsea fields, particularly in deepwater environments, involves substantial capital investments. Operators have also sought the security of alliances with us to ensure timely and cost-effective delivery of subsea and other energy-related systems that provide integrated solutions to meet their needs.
Our alliances establish important ongoing relationships with our customers. While these alliances do not contractually commit our customers to purchase our systems and services, they have historically led to, and we expect that they would continue to result in, such purchases.
No single Subsea customer accounted for 10% or more of our 2018 consolidated revenue.
Competition
As a result of the Merger, we are the only company that can provide the full suite of subsea production equipment, umbilicals, and flowlines, as well as the installation services to develop a subsea production field. Our company competes with companies that supply some of the components as well as installation companies. Our competitors include Aker Solutions ASA, Baker Hughes, a GE Company (“BHGE”), Dril-Quip, Inc., McDermott International, Inc. (“McDermott”), National Oilwell Varco, Oceaneering International, Inc., Saipem S.p.A. (“Saipem”), Schlumberger, Ltd. (“Schlumberger”), and Subsea 7 S.A.
Seasonality
In the North Sea, winter weather generally subdues drilling activity, reducing vessel utilization and demand for subsea services as certain activities cannot be performed. As a result, the level of offshore activity in our Subsea segment is negatively impacted in the first quarter of each year.
Market Environment
The low crude oil price environment over the last three years led many of our customers to reduce their capital spending plans or defer new deepwater projects. The reduction and deferral of projects has resulted in delayed subsea project inbound for the industry. In response to the lower commodity prices and reduced cash flow, operators took actions needed to improve their subsea project economics, and suppliers, in turn, took the steps necessary to further reduce project break-even levels by offering cost-effective approaches for project developments. These actions continue. 
The rate of project sanctioning for new subsea developments has moved higher since the market trough as project economics and operator confidence have improved. The risk of project sanctioning delays is still present in the current environment; however, innovative approaches to subsea projects, like our iEPCI solution, have improved project economics, and many offshore discoveries can be developed economically at today’s crude oil prices. In the long-term, deepwater development is expected to remain a significant part of many of our customers’ portfolios.

Strategy
With our proprietary technologies and production systems, integration expertise, and comprehensive solutions, we are transforming our clients’ project economics. We have used these capabilities to develop a new subsea commercial model that is transforming the way we interact with our customers and create value with them.
Our strategy includes the following priorities:

• | Engagement in the conceptual design and integrated front-end engineering, or iFEED, of subsea development projects to create value through technology and integration of scopes (iEPCI) by simplifying field architecture and accelerating both delivery schedules and time to first production;


• | Innovative research and development (“R&D”), often in collaboration with clients and partners, to develop leading products and technologies that deliver greater efficiency to the client, lower development costs, and enable frontier developments;


• | Superior project execution capabilities allowing the Company to mobilize the right teams, assets, and facilities to capture and profitably execute complex subsea projects and services;


• | Capitalize on combined competencies coming from alliances and partnerships with both clients and suppliers; and


• | Leverage supplier relationships to optimize supply chain market dynamics and implement greater simplification and standardization in products and processes.

Recent and Future Developments
With many of our customers reducing their capital spending plans or deferring new deepwater projects in response to the low crude oil price environment, we have adjusted our workforce and manufacturing capacity to align our operations with our anticipated outlook for project inbound. These restructuring actions have resulted in a leaner cost structure. The operational improvements and cost reductions made in 2016, combined with additional actions taken in 2017 and 2018, will partially offset the anticipated decline in operating margins in 2019.
A completely new suite of products called Subsea 2.0™ (“Subsea 2.0”), commercialized in November 2017, is gaining traction, and the first components are already in the water. Relative to traditional subsea equipment, the Subsea 2.0 technology portfolio significantly reduces the size, weight, and part count of the equipment installed on the seabed. Subsea 2.0 technologies can enhance project economics both as a stand-alone offering and as part of an integrated solution, further unlocking oil and gas reserves that otherwise would not be developed.
We believe that 2016 marked the inflection in subsea order activity as demonstrated by the increased number of final investment decisions made on offshore project developments. The Company’s full-year Subsea inbound orders increased significantly in 2017 and remained at this improved level in 2018, with integrated project awards taking greater share of our order activity. Our integrated business model is clearly demonstrating the ability to positively impact project economics and expand the deepwater opportunity set.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company performed impairment assessments and determined that goodwill and certain of our vessels had carrying values that exceeded their fair value, resulting in an impairment. Refer to Note 12 and Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on these impairments.
In 2019, we expect to see another increase in subsea market activity. We also anticipate a further increase in our inbound orders, where we expect our iEPCI capabilities to provide a competitive advantage as we deliver comprehensive and differentiated solutions. In addition, we anticipate the following longer-term trends in the subsea market:

• | Increased market adoption of integrated subsea projects, leading to further penetration of our integrated business model and higher levels of iEPCI order activity for our Company;


• | Growing service opportunities, driven by (i) higher levels of project activity, (ii) increased asset integrity and production management activities focused on improving uptime and production volume, and (iii) increased maintenance and intervention activity resulting from an expanding and aging installed equipment base;


• | Smaller projects and direct awards will continue to contribute meaningfully to our order mix. In 2017 and 2018, these awards collectively represented just under one-half of total subsea inbound orders, with the remainder being publicly announced projects and subsea service activities. Subsea tiebacks are often part of this mix, and these shorter cycle brownfield expansions provide operators with faster paybacks and higher returns;

• | Capital expenditures for new greenfield projects will be sanctioned and average project size will increase as the subsea market recovery develops;


• | There is a growing trend towards independent operators and new entrants undertaking subsea developments; we are a natural partner for this customer group because of our ability to offer fully integrated solutions; and


• | Natural gas developments are growing in prominence. We believe that more than half of offshore capital expenditures could be directed at natural gas developments by early next decade.

We continue to work closely with our customers and believe that, in the context of lower oil prices, with our unique business model we can further reduce their project break-even levels by offering cost-effective approaches to their project developments and accelerate time to first oil and gas.
Product Development
We continue to expand our Subsea portfolio of technology-based solutions to deliver a complete production system for high pressure and high temperature applications. In 2014, we entered into a joint development agreement with several major operators to develop common standards for subsea production equipment capable of operating at pressures as high as 20,000 psi and temperatures up to 350º F. This joint development agreement is delivering standardized design, materials, processes, and interfaces to provide improved reliability and operations over the life of the field.
Technology development progressed on the Subsea 2.0 product platform, the next generation of subsea equipment, using designs that are significantly simpler, leaner, and smarter than current designs. These new products incorporate a modular product architecture and component level standardization to enable a flexible configure-to-order approach that delivers a 70-90% reduction in manual activities during the production process, reducing hardware delivery time for clients. The products are expected to deliver breakthroughs in the way subsea products are manufactured, assembled, installed, and maintained over the life of the field. The smaller, lighter products achieve up to a 50% reduction in size, weight, and part count, while maintaining the same or improved functionality. When combined with iEPCI, our powerful integrated approach to field architecture, and project execution, Subsea 2.0 improves project economics and unlocks first oil and gas faster.
Several major elements of the portfolio were launched to the market during the year, including the compact tree, compact manifold, flexible jumpers, distribution, controls, and horizontal connectors. We have incorporated Subsea 2.0 elements into several projects including the Shell Kaikias subsea development, which sits in 4,575 feet of water in the Gulf of Mexico and is a tieback to the Ursa platform. On March 4, 2018, TechnipFMC and Shell celebrated the successful delivery and installation of the first application of TechnipFMC’s compact pipeline and manifold (“PLEM”) and horizontal connection system technologies with flexible jumpers. We also completed the development of our second generation of electrically trace heated pipe-in-pipe (“ETH-PiP”), which delivers significant advancements in power output and length-enabling hydrate prevention in longer distance tiebacks of 50 kilometers or more.
In addition to investments to develop lower cost production solutions, we also invest in the development of technology to expand our service portfolio. During the year, we qualified new technology to enable the inspection of flexible risers and flowlines. We also are advancing subsea robotic productivity through the development of more efficient ROV systems that are easier to operate and maintain.
Acquisitions and Investments
In February 2018, we signed an agreement with the Island Offshore Group to acquire a 51% stake in Island Offshore’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Island Offshore Subsea AS. Island Offshore Subsea AS provides RLWI project management and engineering services for plug and abandonment (“P&A”), riserless coiled tubing, and well completion operations. In connection with the acquisition of the controlling interest, TechnipFMC and Island Offshore entered into a strategic cooperation agreement to deliver RLWI services on a worldwide basis, which also include TechnipFMC’s RLWI capabilities. Island Offshore Subsea AS has been rebranded to TIOS and is now the operating unit for TechnipFMC’s RLWI activities worldwide.
In March 2018, we announced a collaboration agreement with Magma Global Ltd. to develop a new generation of hybrid flexible pipe (“HFP”) for use in offshore applications. HFP is expected to provide increased strength and fatigue performance, while also achieving dramatic weight and cost reductions, for subsea fluid transport applications. As part of the collaboration, TechnipFMC purchased a minority stake in Magma Global.

We are also well positioned in the GTL market and are one of the few contractors with experience in large GTL facilities. We have unique experience in delivering plants using Sasol’s “Slurry Phase Distillate” technology, and we have provided front-end engineering design for the Fischer-Tropsch section of more than 60% of commercial coal-to-liquids and GTL capacity worldwide. Our clients also benefit from our development of environmental protection measures, including low nitrogen oxide and sulfur oxide emissions, waste-water treatment, and waste management.
10

We specialize in the design and construction of large-scale gas treatment complexes as well as existing facility upgrades. Gas treatment includes the removal of carbon dioxide and sulfur components from natural gas using chemical or physical solvents, sulfur recovery, and gas sweetening processes based on the use of an amine solvent. The Company ranks among the top contractors in the field in relation to sulfur recovery units installed in refineries or natural gas processing plants. Given our long-term experience in the field of sour gas processing, we can provide support to clients for the overall evaluation of the gas sweetening/sulfur recovery chain and the selection of optimum technologies.
Ethylene - We hold proprietary technologies and are a leader in the design, construction, and commissioning of ethylene production plants. We design steam crackers, from concept stage through construction and commissioning, for both new plants (including mega-crackers) and plant expansions. We have a portfolio of the latest generation of commercially proven technologies and are uniquely positioned to be both a licensor and an EPC contractor. Our technological developments have improved the energy efficiency in ethylene plants by improving thermal efficiency of the furnaces and reducing the compression power required per ton, reducing carbon dioxide emissions per ton of ethylene by 30% over the last 25 years.
Petrochemicals and Fertilizers - We are one of the world leaders in the process design, licensing, and realization of petrochemical units, including basic chemicals, intermediate and derivative plants. We provide a range of services that includes process technology licensing and development and full EPC complexes. We license a portfolio of chemical technologies through long-standing alliances and relationships with leading manufacturing companies and technology providers. We have research centers to develop and test technologies for polymer and petrochemical applications, where fully automated pilot plants gather design data to scale-up processes for commercialization
Hydrogen - Hydrogen is the most widely used industrial gas in the refining, chemical, and petrochemical industries, and is also widely used in the production of cleaner transport fuels. We offer a single point of responsibility for the design and construction of hydrogen and synthesis gas production units, with solutions ranging from Process Design Packages to full lump-sum turnkey projects. We also offer services for maintenance and performance optimization of running units. We have solutions in place for carbon capture readiness in future hydrogen plants, targeting more than a two-thirds reduction in carbon dioxide release from the hydrogen plant.
Fixed Platforms - We offer a broad range of fixed platform solutions in shallow water, including: (i) large conventional platforms with pile steel jackets whose topsides are installed offshore either by heavy lift vessel or floatover; (ii) small, conventional platforms installed by small crane vessel; (iii) steel gravity-based structure platforms, generally with floatover topsides; and (iv) small to large self-installing platforms.
Floating Production Units - We offer a broad range of floating platform solutions for moderate to ultra-deepwater applications, including:

• | Spar Platforms: Capable of operating in a wide range of water depths, the Spar is a low motion floater that can support full drilling with dry trees or with tender assist and flexible or steel catenary risers. The Spar topside is installed offshore either by heavy lift vessel or floatover.


• | Semi-Submersible Platforms: These platforms are well-suited to oil field developments where subsea wells drilled by the mobile offshore drilling unit are appropriate. Semi-Submersibles can operate in a wide range of water depths and have full drilling and large topside capability. We have our own unique design of low-motion Semi-Submersible platforms that can accommodate dry trees.


• | Tension-Leg Platforms (“TLP”): An appropriate platform for deepwater drilling and production in water depths up to approximately 1,500 meters, the TLP can be configured with full drilling or with tender assist and is generally a dry tree unit. The TLP and our topside can be integrated onto the substructure at a cost-effective manner at quayside.

Floating Production, Storage and Offloading (“FPSO”) - Working with our construction partners, we have delivered some of the largest FPSOs in the world. FPSOs enable offshore production and storage of oil which is then transported by a tanker where pipeline export is uneconomic or technically challenged (for example, ultra-deepwater). FPSOs utilize onshore processes adapted to a floating marine environment. They can support large topsides and hence large production capacities. Leveraging our industry-leading capabilities in gas monetization, particularly FLNG, we are currently well-positioned to leverage the global offshore gas cycle with gas FPSO.
11

Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (“FLNG”) - FLNG is an innovative alternative to traditional onshore LNG plants and is suitable for remote and stranded gas fields that were previously deemed uneconomical. FLNG is a commercially attractive and environmentally friendly approach to the monetization of offshore gas fields. It avoids the potential environmental impact of building and operating long-distance pipelines and extensive onshore infrastructure. We pioneered the FLNG industry and are the only contractor to integrate all of the core activities required to deliver an FLNG project: LNG process, offshore facilities, loading systems, and subsea infrastructure. We delivered the industry’s first and largest FLNG facilities and are currently executing two FLNG projects, Shell Prelude and ENI Coral South, with the latter being the inaugural LNG facility in Africa.
Capital Intensity
Our Onshore/Offshore business executes turnkey contracts on a lump-sum or reimbursable basis through engineering, procurement, construction, and project management services on both brownfield and greenfield developments and projects. We can execute EPC contracts through sole responsibility, joint ventures, or consortiums with other companies. We often receive advance payments and progress billings from our customers to fund initial development and working capital requirements. However, our working capital balances can vary significantly through the project lifecycle depending on the payment terms and timing on contracts.
Dependence on Key Customers
Generally, our Onshore/Offshore customers are major integrated oil companies or national oil companies. We have developed privileged relationships with our main clients around our portfolio of technologies, expertise in project management, and execution. Our customers have sought the security of alliances with us to ensure timely and cost-effective delivery of their projects.
One customer, JSC Yamal LNG, represented more than 10% of 2018 consolidated revenue. We consolidate all revenue from the JSC Yamal LNG partnership, including revenue associated with the minority partners of the joint venture.
Competition
In the Onshore market, we face a large number of competitors, including U.S. companies (Bechtel Corporation, Fluor Corporation, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., KBR, Inc. (“KBR”), and McDermott), Japanese companies (Chiyoda Corporation, JGC Corporation, and Toyo Engineering Corporation), European companies (Maire Tecnimont Group, Petrofac, Ltd., Saipem, Tecnicas Reunidas, S.A., and John Wood Group plc), and Korean companies (Daelim Industrial Co., Ltd., GS Caltex Corporation, Hyundai Oilbank, Samsung Engineering Co., Ltd., and SK Energy Co., Ltd.). In addition, we compete against smaller, specialized, and locally-based engineering and construction companies in certain countries or for specific units such as petrochemicals.
Competition in the Offshore market is relatively fragmented and includes various players with different core capabilities, including offshore construction contractors, shipyards, leasing contractors, and local yards in Asia Pacific, the Middle East, and Africa. Competitors include Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co., Ltd., Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd., Samsung Heavy Industries Co., Ltd., Saipem, KBR, McDermott, China Offshore Oil Engineering Co., Ltd., and JGC Corporation.
Seasonality
Our Onshore business is generally not impacted by seasonality. Our Offshore business could be impacted by seasonality in the North Sea region during the offshore installation campaign at the end of a project. 
Market Environment 
The Onshore market is impacted by changes in oil and gas prices, but is typically more resilient than offshore markets. Indeed, some downstream markets have benefited from low commodity prices where market fundamentals are influenced by other economic factors (e.g., petrochemicals and fertilizers that are linked to world growth). This market dynamic is mostly present in developing countries with rapidly growing energy demand (in particular, Asia) and countries with abundant oil and gas reserves that have decided to expand downstream (in particular, the Middle East and Russia). The Onshore market remains relatively small in Western Europe, although with a diversity of projects, including a second generation of bio ethanol plants. The North American Onshore market is experiencing a strong recovery in the wake of the oil and gas shale revolution.

The Offshore market is more directly impacted by changes in oil prices. Offshore fields in the Gulf of Mexico, the Middle East, and the North Sea were the traditional backbone for investments in the last decade. Recent discoveries of offshore fields with reserves in other regions such as Brazil, Australia, and East Africa are expected to become drivers of increased investment. In the long-term, gas is expected to become a bigger portion of the global energy mix, requiring new investments in the upstream industry. 
Strategy
Our strategy is based on the following:

• | Selectivity of clients, projects, and geographies, which serves to maintain early engagement, leading to influence over technological choices, design considerations, and project specifications that make projects economically viable;


• | Technology-driven differentiation with strong project management, which eliminates or significantly reduces technical and project risks, leading to both schedule and cost certainty without compromising safety; and


• | Excellence in project execution, because of our global, multi-center project delivery model complemented by deep partnerships and alliances to ensure the best possible execution for complex projects.

TechnipFMC’s Onshore/Offshore segment continually invests in innovation and technology. The Company is at the forefront of digital solutions due in part to our investment in 3D models and interfaces.
Recent and Future Developments
In response to industry challenges to improve project economics in the Offshore market, we are continuing our cost reduction efforts to align capacity and capabilities with market demands. As such, in 2018 we sold our interest in the Pori Offshore yard in Finland.
Onshore market activity continues to provide a tangible set of opportunities, including natural gas, refining, and petrochemical projects.
Activity in LNG is fueled by higher demand for natural gas a fuel source continues to take a greater share of global energy demand. This trend is structural, driven by market preference for cleaner energy sources and the need to satisfy growing domestic demand in markets such as Asia and the Middle East. To meet this demand, we believe that large gas projects will need to be sanctioned in the near future, as evidenced by both the significant increase in pre-FEED and FEED contract awards and higher levels of pre-bid project planning experienced in 2018.
As Onshore market activity levels remain stable, it provides our business with the opportunity to engage early with our clients and pursue additional front-end engineering studies which serve to optimize project economics while also mitigating risks during project execution. Market opportunities for downstream front-end engineering studies and full EPC projects are most prevalent in the Middle East, African, and Asian markets in both LNG and refining. We continue to track near-term prospects for petrochemical and fertilizer projects as well. We believe this broad opportunity set could generate additional inbound orders in the coming years.
Product Development
We are positioned as a premier provider of project execution and technology solutions which enable our customers to unlock resources at advantaged capital and operating economics. We invest Onshore/Offshore R&D in these main areas: (i) the development of process technology and equipment for economy of scale; (ii) continuous improvement of our proprietary process technologies and other solutions to reduce operating and investment cost; and (iii) diversification of our proprietary technology offering.
Our Offshore R&D efforts are focused on improving the economics of FLNG through innovations in design and constructability. We also launched a new program to develop solutions for smaller scale FLNG and LNG import projects. Additionally, to further reduce operating and investment costs, we progressed the development of robotic solutions for offshore platforms and continue work on a standard and adaptable design for Normally Unmanned Installations (“NUI”).

Capital Intensity
Surface Technologies manufactures most of its products, resulting in a reliance on manufacturing locations throughout the world. We also maintain a large quantity of rental equipment related to pressure operations.
Dependence on Key Customers
No single Surface Technologies customer accounted for 10% or more of our 2018 consolidated revenue.
Competition
Surface Technologies is a market leader for our primary products and services. Some of the factors that distinguish us from other companies in the same sector include our technological innovation, reliability, product quality, and ability to integrate across a broad portfolio scope. Surface Technologies competes with other companies that supply surface production equipment and pressure control products. Some of our major competitors in Surface Technologies include BHGE, Cactus, Inc., Forum Energy Technologies, Inc., Gardner Denver, Inc., Schlumberger, and The Weir Group plc.
Seasonality
In Western Canada, the level of activity in the oilfield services industry is influenced by seasonal weather patterns. During the spring months, wet weather and the spring thaw make the ground unstable and less capable of supporting heavy equipment and machinery. As a result, municipalities and provincial transportation departments enforce road bans that restrict the movement of heavy equipment during the spring months, which reduces activity levels. There is greater demand for oilfield services provided by our Canadian services business, specifically completion services, in the winter season when freezing permits the movement and operation of heavy equipment. Activities tend to increase in the fall and peak in the winter months of November through March.
Market Environment
Surface Technologies’ performance is typically driven by variations in global drilling activity, creating a dynamic environment. Operating results can be further impacted by pressure pumping activity and completions intensity in the Americas. 
The North American market recovery that began in late 2016 continued well into 2018, with rig count and drilling and completion activity steadily improving through the first half of the year. The increased activity resulted in stronger demand for the Company’s products and services. The market also benefited from increased service intensity related to hydraulic fracturing activity. As a result of these market dynamics, we experienced stronger demand for pressure control equipment. When combined with our cost rationalization initiatives, we were able to capture the economic benefits of the higher activity levels. Activity outside of North America remained generally stable after turning down in 2015 but continued to experience competitive pricing pressure in certain markets.

Strategy
Our strategy is focused on being a leading provider of best-cost and high-performance integrated assets and services for our customers in the drilling, completion, upstream production, and midstream transportation sectors. We distinguish our offering by combining three elements – a flawless customer experience, leading digital tools, and integrated systems. 
Providing a flawless customer experience is our most important priority and occupies the central pillar of our strategy. For this reason, we have developed the digital tools and customer-centric organizational culture that enable our customers to seamlessly transition into the next era of hydrocarbon production. In addition, our system integration capabilities and automation technologies (i) enable reductions in both capital and operating expenditures by reducing cycle time, allowing our customers to achieve first oil faster, and (ii) optimize the production process by minimizing facility footprint, manual interventions, and environmental impacts.
Recent and Future Developments
We continue to operate in a challenging environment as global activity is still below levels achieved in the prior industry cycle and pricing remains competitive. In the second half of 2018, well completion activity in North America moved lower, negatively impacting demand for pressure control equipment. The activity decline was driven by pipeline takeaway capacity constraints, lower commodity prices, and the depletion of operator budgets, constraining activity to certain oil and gas basins that can generate acceptable returns.
Despite the decline in completions activity, North American drilling activity continued to move higher throughout 2018. With increased well count and reduced completions, the backlog of uncompleted wells continued to grow and further supports our view that completions activity should recover in the second half of 2019 as operator budgets replenish and takeaway capacity improves. As we entered 2019, drilling activity started to decline from the recent peak levels achieved in late 2018. However, with oil prices having rebound from recent lows and operator budgets replenished in the new year, we continue to anticipate that activity levels will move higher for both drilling and completions as we progress through the year.
Outside of the Americas, we expect global activity levels to improve in 2019. Confidence in an improved outlook for our business is further supported by the strong growth experienced in inbound orders and backlog in late 2018. We believe that the Middle East, Asia Pacific, and Northern Europe are best poised for new order growth. Our international business continued to experience competitive pricing pressure throughout much of 2018. We believe market pricing has since stabilized and expect this pricing environment to continue throughout 2019.
Product Development
In early 2018, we successfully launched the 2” 10,000 psi cage choke expanding the Company’s traditional product offering for onshore solutions and delivering our first order to a major Middle East customer. For flow testing and early production, we launched a fully automated and digitized Flow Testing Advanced Automated Package (AAP) leveraging the Company’s superior de-sanding and fluid-separation technology and as well as our digital platform, which allows for remote monitoring and real-time data capture via the cloud. We also launched compact, modular permanent production facility solutions for both onshore-shale and offshore shallow-water fields and have recently received our first contract award.
Acquisitions and Investments
In October 2017, we announced an agreement to acquire Plexus Holding plc’s (“Plexus”) wellhead exploration equipment and services business for jack up applications. In conjunction with our global footprint and market presence, this portfolio expansion in the mudline and high-pressure, high-temperature arena will enable us to be a leading provider of products and services to the global jack-up exploration drilling market. This acquisition fits within our strategy to extend and strengthen our position in exploration-drilling products and services while leveraging our global field presence. The acquisition closed in the first quarter of 2018.
The business has been integrated into our Surface Technologies segment, including the transfer of key personnel from Plexus, with their specialized expertise, to ensure continuity and ongoing customer support. The business continues to operate from the existing location in Dyce, Aberdeen, United Kingdom.
