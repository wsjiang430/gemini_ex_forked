Item 1 - Business.
Our Company
We are one of the world’s largest door and window manufacturers. We design, produce, and distribute an extensive range of interior and exterior doors, wood, vinyl, and aluminum windows, and related products for use in the new construction and R&R of residential homes and, to a lesser extent, non-residential buildings. 
We market our products globally under the JELD-WEN brand, along with several market-leading regional brands such as Swedoor and DANA in Europe and Corinthian, Stegbar, and Trend in Australia. Our customers include wholesale distributors and retailers as well as individual contractors and consumers. As a result, our business is highly diversified by distribution channel, geography, and construction application, as illustrated in the charts below: 

2018 Net Revenues $4,347 million


Distribution Channel | Geography | Construction Application(1)


(1) | Percentage of net revenues by construction application is a management estimate based on the end markets into which our customers sell.

As one of the largest door and window companies in the world, we have invested significant capital to build a business platform that we believe is unique among our competitors. We operate 135 manufacturing facilities in 20 countries, located primarily in North America, Europe, and Australia. Our global manufacturing footprint is strategically sized and located to meet the delivery requirements of our customers. For many product lines, our manufacturing processes are vertically integrated, enhancing our range of capabilities, our ability to innovate, and our quality control, as well as providing us with supply chain, transportation, and working capital savings. We believe that our manufacturing network allows us to deliver our broad portfolio of products to a wide range of customers across the globe, improves our customer service, and strengthens our market positions.
Our History
We were founded in 1960 by Richard L. Wendt, when he, together with four business partners, bought a millwork plant in Oregon. The subsequent decades were a time of successful expansion and growth as we added different businesses and product categories such as interior doors, exterior steel doors, and vinyl windows. Our first overseas acquisition was Norma Doors in Spain in 1992 and since then we acquired or established numerous businesses in Europe, Australia, Asia, Canada, Mexico, and Chile, making us a truly global company. 
In October 2011, certain funds managed by affiliates of Onex acquired a majority of the combined voting power in the Company through the acquisition of convertible debt and convertible preferred equity. After the Onex investment, we began the transformation of our business from a family-run operation to a global organization with independent, professional management. The transformation accelerated after 2013 with the hiring of a new senior management team strategically recruited from a number of world-class industrial companies. Our new management team has decades of experience driving operational improvement, innovation, and growth, both organically and through acquisitions.
On February 1, 2017, we closed an IPO of 28.75 million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $23.00 per share. We sold 22.27 million shares and Onex sold 6.48 million shares from which we did not receive any proceeds. We received $472.4 million after deducting underwriters’ discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the IPO to repay $375.0 million of indebtedness outstanding under our Term Loan Facility and used the remaining net

proceeds for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including sales and marketing activities, general and administrative matters, capital expenditures, and to invest in or acquire complementary businesses, products, services, technologies, or other assets. 
In May and November 2017, we completed secondary public offerings of 16.1 million and $14.4 million shares, respectively, of our Common Stock, substantially all of which were owned by Onex. 
As of December 31, 2018, Onex owned approximately 32.4% of our outstanding shares of common stock.
Our Business Strategy and Operating Model
We seek to achieve best-in-industry financial performance through the disciplined execution of:

• | operational excellence programs, including JEM and our facility rationalization and modernization initiative to improve our profit margins and free cash flow;


• | initiatives to drive profitable organic sales growth, including new product development, investments in our brands and marketing, channel management, and pricing optimization; and


• | disciplined and balanced capital allocation with a focus on maximizing returns.

The execution of our strategy is supported and enabled by a relentless focus on talent management. Over the long term, we believe that the implementation of our strategy is largely within our control and is less dependent on external factors. The key elements of our strategy are described further below.
Expand Our Margins and Free Cash Flow Through Operational Excellence
With 135 manufacturing facilities around the world and approximately 23,000 dedicated employees, we have a global manufacturing footprint that is unique in the door and window industry. We believe we have identified a substantial opportunity to improve our profitability by building a culture of operational excellence and continuous improvement across all aspects of our business through our JEM initiative. Due to our history of growth through acquisitions, historically, we were not centrally managed and had a limited focus on standard work, cost reduction, operational improvement, and strategic material sourcing. This resulted in profit margins that were lower than our building products peers and far lower than what would typically be expected of a world-class industrial company.
Our senior management team has a proven track record of implementing operational excellence programs at some of the world’s leading industrial manufacturing businesses, and we believe the same successes can be realized at JELD-WEN. Key areas of focus of our operational excellence program include:

• | reducing labor costs, overtime, and waste by optimizing planning and manufacturing processes;


• | reducing or minimizing increases in material costs through strategic global sourcing and value-added re-engineering of components, in part by leveraging our significant spend and the global nature of our purchases;


• | reducing warranty costs by improving quality; and


• | a JEM-enabled facility rationalization and modernization initiative that will reduce overhead costs and complexity, while increasing our overall capacity and improving our service levels.

Drive Profitable Organic Sales Growth
We seek to deliver profitable organic revenue growth through several strategic initiatives, including new product development, brand and marketing investment, channel management, and continued pricing optimization. These strategic initiatives will drive our sales mix to include more value-added, higher margin products.

• | New Product Development: Our management team has renewed our focus on innovation and new product development. We believe that leading the market in innovation will enhance demand for our products, increase the rate at which our products are specified into home and non-residential designs, and allow us to sell a higher margin product mix.


• | Brand and Marketing Investment: We recently began to make meaningful investments in new marketing initiatives designed to enhance the positioning of the JELD-WEN family of brands. Our new initiatives include marketing campaigns focused on the distributor, builder, architect, and consumer communities.


• | Channel Management: We are implementing initiatives and investing in tools and technology to enhance our relationships with key customers, make it easier for them to source from JELD-WEN, and support their ability to sell our products in the marketplace. These incentives help our customers grow their businesses

in a profitable manner while also improving our sales volumes and the margin of our product mix. 

• | Pricing Optimization: We are focused on profitable growth and will continue to employ a strategic approach to pricing our products. Pricing discipline is an important element of our effort to improve our profit margins and earn an appropriate return on our invested capital.

Disciplined and Balanced Capital Allocation 
We believe there is a significant opportunity to increase shareholder value by deploying our free cash flow in a balanced manner between strategic M&A and share repurchases. Our approach to capital allocation includes a disciplined, returns-focused evaluation of opportunities. 
Collectively, our senior management team has acquired and integrated more than 100 companies during their careers. Leveraging this collective experience, we have developed a disciplined governance process for identifying, evaluating, and integrating acquisitions. Since 2015, we have completed 13 acquisitions across North America, Europe, and Australasia. Our M&A focuses on three types of opportunities:

• | Expansion in Existing Markets: The competitive landscape in several of our key markets remains highly fragmented, which creates an opportunity for us to acquire businesses that will, enhance our market-leading positions and realize synergies through the elimination of duplicate costs. Our acquisitions of Mattiovi (Finland), Dooria (Norway), Kolder (Australia), Trend (Australia) and A&L (Australia) are examples of this strategy.


• | Enhancing Our Portfolio of Products and Service Offerings: We strive to provide the broadest range of doors and windows to our customers so that we can enhance our share of their overall spend. Along with our organic new product development pipeline, we seek to expand our door and window product and service portfolio by acquiring companies that have developed unique products, technologies, or value-added services. Our acquisitions of Karona (stile and rail doors), LaCantina (folding and sliding wall systems), Aneeta (sashless windows), Breezway (louver windows), MMI Door (value-added supplier of customized door systems), Domoferm (steel frames and doors), and ABS (value-added supplier of millwork to both residential and commercial channels) are examples of this strategy.


• | Product Adjacencies and New Geographies: Opportunities also exist to expand our company through the acquisition of complementary door and window manufacturers in new geographies as well as providers of product adjacencies. While this has not been a major focus in recent years, we expect it to be a key element in our long-term growth.

In addition to M&A, we seek opportunities to create value by opportunistically repurchasing our own common stock. In 2018, our board of directors approved a $250.0 million share repurchase authorization, under which we repurchased $125.0 million during 2018. We will consistently balance the growth, strategic fit, and returns potential of acquisition opportunities against the return potential of purchasing our own shares. 
Our Products
We provide a broad portfolio of interior and exterior doors, windows, and related products, manufactured from a variety of wood, metal, and composite materials and offered across a full spectrum of price points. In the year ended December 31, 2018, our door sales accounted for 66% of net revenues, our window sales accounted for 21% of net revenues, and our other ancillary products and services accounted for 13% of net revenues. 
Doors 
We are a leading global manufacturer of residential doors. We offer a full line of residential interior and exterior door products, including patio doors and folding or sliding wall systems. Our non-residential door product offering is concentrated in Europe, where we are a leading non-residential door provider by net revenues in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Scandinavia. In order to meet the style, design, and durability needs of our customers across a broad range of price points, our product portfolio encompasses many types of materials, including wood veneer, composite wood, steel, glass, and fiberglass. Our interior and exterior residential door models generally retail at prices ranging from $30 to $40 for our most basic products to several thousand dollars for our high-end exterior doors. Our highest volume products include molded interior doors, which are made from two composite molded door skins joined by a wooden frame and filled with a hollow honey-cell core or other solid core materials. These low-cost doors are the most popular choice for interior residential applications in North America and also are prevalent in France and the U.K. In Europe, we also sell highly engineered non-residential doors, with features such as soundproofing, fire resistance, radiation resistance, and added security. We also manufacture stile and rail doors in our Southeast Asia and U.S. manufacturing facilities. In the U.S.we also manufacture folding and sliding wall systems. Additionally, we offer profitable value-added distribution services in all of our markets, 
10

Back to top

including customizable configuration services, specialized component options, and multiple finishing options. These services are valued by labor constrained customers and allow us to capture more profit from the sale of our door products. In the U.S., our recent acquisitions of ABS and MMI Door are examples of our increased focus on value-added services. Our newest door product offerings include steel doors, steel door frames, and fire doors for commercial and residential markets through our recent acquisition of Domoferm, which closed in February 2018. 
Windows 
We are a leading global manufacturer of residential windows. We manufacture wood, vinyl, and aluminum windows in North America, wood and aluminum windows in Australia, and wood windows in the U.K. Our window product lines comprise a full range of styles, features, and energy-saving options in order to meet the varied needs of our customers in each of our regional end markets. For example, our high performance wood and vinyl windows with multi-pane glazing and superior energy efficiency properties are in greater demand in Canada and the northern U.S. By contrast, our lower-cost aluminum framed windows are popular in some regions of the southern U.S., while in coastal Florida certain local building codes require windows that can withstand the impact of debris propelled by hurricane-force winds. Wood windows are prevalent as a high-end option in all of our markets because they possess both insulating qualities and the beauty of natural wood. In North America, our wood windows and patio doors include our proprietary AuraLast treatment, which is a unique water-based wood protection process that provides protection against wood rot and decay. We believe AuraLast is unique in its ability to penetrate and protect the wood through to the core, as opposed to being a shallow or surface-only treatment. Our most recent window product offerings include sashless window systems through our 2015 acquisition of Aneeta and louver window systems through our 2016 acquisition of Breezway. Our windows typically retail at prices ranging from $100 to $200 for a basic vinyl window to over $1,000 for a custom energy-efficient wood window. We believe that our innovative energy-efficient windows position us to benefit from increasing environmental awareness among consumers and from changes in local building codes. In recognition of our expansive energy-efficient product line, we have been an ENERGY STAR partner since 1998. 
Other Ancillary Products and Services 
In certain regions, we sell a variety of other products that are ancillary to our door and window offerings, which we do not classify as door or window sales. These products include shower enclosures and wardrobes, moldings, trim board, lumber, cutstock, glass, staircases, hardware and locks, cabinets, and screens. We sell molded door skins to certain customers pursuant to long-term contracts, and these customers in turn use the molded door skins to manufacture interior doors and compete directly against us in the marketplace. Miscellaneous installation and other services are also included in this category. 
Our Segments
We operate within the global market for residential and non-residential doors and windows with sales spanning approximately 100 countries. While we operate globally, the markets for doors and windows are regionally distinct with suppliers manufacturing finished goods in proximity to their customers. Finished doors and windows are generally bulky, expensive to ship, and, in the case of windows, fragile. Designs and specifications of doors and windows also vary from country to country due to differing construction methods, building codes, certification requirements, and consumer preferences. Customers also demand short delivery times and can require special order customizations. We believe that we are well-positioned to meet the global demands of our customers due to our market leadership, strong brands, broad product line, and strategically located manufacturing and distribution facilities. 
Our operations are managed and reported in three reportable segments, organized and managed principally by geographic region. Our reportable segments are North America, Europe and Australasia. We report all other business activities in Corporate and unallocated costs. Factors considered in determining the three reportable segments include the nature of business activities, the management structure accountable directly to the CODM for operating and administrative activities, the discrete financial information available and the information regularly presented to the CODM.
North America
In our North America segment, we compete primarily in the market for residential doors and windows in the U.S. and Canada. We are the only manufacturer that offers a full line of interior and exterior door and window products, allowing us to offer a more complete solution to our customer base. We believe that our leading position in the North American market will enable us to benefit from continued recovery in residential construction activity over the next several years. We believe that our total market opportunity in North America also includes non-residential applications, other related building products, and value-added services. 
Europe 
The European market for doors is highly fragmented and we have the only platform in the industry capable of serving nearly all European countries. In our Europe segment, we compete primarily in the market for residential and non-residential doors in 
11

Back to top

Germany, the U.K., France, Austria, Switzerland, and Scandinavia. We believe that our total market opportunity in Europe also includes other European countries, other door product lines, related building products, and value-added services. Although construction activity in Europe has been slower to recover compared to construction activity in North America, new construction and R&R activity is expected to increase across Europe over the next several years. 
Australasia 
In our Australasia segment, we compete primarily in the market for residential doors and windows in Australia, where we hold a leading position by net revenues. We believe that our total market opportunity in the Australasia region also includes non-residential applications and other countries in the region, as well as other related building products, and value-added services. For example, we also sell a full line of shower enclosures and closet systems throughout Australia. 
Financial information regarding our segments is included in Note 18 - Segment Information to our financial statements included in this Form 10-K.
Materials
Historically our sourcing function operated primarily in a regional, decentralized model. With our recent leadership transformation, we have increased our focus on making global sourcing a competitive advantage, as evidenced by our hiring in early 2016 of an experienced procurement executive to lead our global sourcing function. Under his leadership, our focus has been and will continue to be on minimizing material costs through strategic global sourcing and value-added re-engineering of components. We believe leveraging our significant spending and the global nature of our purchases will allow us to achieve these goals. 
We generally maintain a diversified supply base for the materials used in our manufacturing operations. Materials represented approximately 51% of our cost of sales in the year ended December 31, 2018. The primary materials used for our door business include wood, wood veneers, wood composites, steel, glass, internally produced door skins, fiberglass compound, and hardware, as well as petroleum-based products such as resin and binders. The primary materials for our window business include wood, wood components, glass, hardware, aluminum extrusions, and vinyl extrusions. Wood components for our window operations are sourced primarily from our own manufacturing plants, which allow us to improve margins and take advantage of our proprietary technologies such as our AuraLast wood treatment process. 
We track commodities in order to understand our vendors’ costs, realizing that our costs are determined by the broader competitive market as well as by increases in the inputs to our vendors. In order to manage the risk in material costs, we develop strategic relationships with suppliers, routinely evaluate substitute components, develop new products, vertically integrate where applicable and seek alternative sources of supply from multiple vendors and often from multiple geographies. 
Seasonality
In a typical year, our operating results are impacted by seasonality. Historically, peak season for home construction and remodeling in our North America and Europe segments, which represent the substantial majority of our revenues, generally corresponds with the second and third calendar quarters, and therefore our sales volume is usually higher during those quarters. Seasonal variations in operating results may be impacted by inclement weather conditions, such as cold or wet weather, which can delay construction projects. 
Sales and Marketing
We actively market and sell our products directly to our customers around the world through our global sales force and indirectly through our marketing and branding initiatives. Our global sales force, which is organized and managed regionally, focuses on building and maintaining relationships with key customers as well as managing customer supply needs and arranging in-store promotional initiatives. In North America, we also have a dedicated team that focuses on our large home center customers. We have recently made significant investments in tools and technologies to enhance the effectiveness of our sales force and improve ease of doing business. For example, we are in the process of deploying Salesforce.com on a global basis, which will provide us with a common global customer relationship management platform. In addition, we are in the process of simplifying our order entry process by implementing online configuration tools. We have introduced an electronic ordering system for easy order placement, and we intend to expand our online retail sales. Our new strategy also includes initiatives focused on expanding our market through the use of social media. 
We have restructured the commission and incentive plans of our sales team to drive focus on achieving profitable growth. We have also invested significantly in our architectural sales force by adding staff and tools to increase the frequency with which our 
12

Back to top

products are specified by architects. We believe these investments will increase sales force effectiveness, create pull-through demand, and optimize sales force productivity. 
We believe that our broad product portfolio of both doors and windows in North America and Australasia is a competitive advantage as it allows us to cross-sell our door and window products to our end customers, many of whom find it more efficient to choose one supplier for their door and window needs on a given project. None of our primary competitors in these regions offers a similarly complete range of windows as well as interior and exterior doors. 
Research and Development 
Following a number of years during and after the global financial crisis of limited investment in new product development, a core element of our strategy is a renewed focus on innovation and the development of new products and technologies. We believe that leading the market in innovation will enhance demand for our products and allow us to sell a higher margin product mix. Our research and development efforts encompass new product development, derivative product development, as well as value added re-engineering of components in our existing products leading to reduced costs and manufacturing efficiencies. We have also designed a new governance process that prioritizes the most impactful projects and is expected to improve the efficiency and quality of our research and development efforts. The governance process is currently being deployed globally, such that we can leverage best practices from region to region. Additionally, a substantial driver of our acquisition activity has been increasing access to new and innovative products. 
Although product specifications and certifications vary from country to country, the global nature of our operations allows us to leverage our global innovation capabilities and share new product designs across our markets. We believe that the global nature of our research and development capabilities is unique among our door and window competition. An example of global sharing of innovation is the “soft close” door system, which is based on hardware originally designed and manufactured by our European operations that is now being offered in North America and Australia. Additionally, we have successfully launched new door designs into our North American and Australian markets that were originally developed in our European operations. 
Customers
We sell our products worldwide and have well-established relationships with numerous customers throughout the door and window distribution chain in each of our end markets, including retail home centers, wholesale distributors, and building product dealers that supply homebuilders, contractors, and consumers. Our wholesale customers include such industry leaders as BMC/Stock Building Supply, ProBuild/Builders First Source, Saint-Gobain, and the Holzring group. Our home center customers include, among others, The Home Depot, Lowes, and Menards in North America; B&Q, Howdens, and Bauhaus in Europe; and Bunnings Warehouse in Australia. We have maintained relationships with the majority of our top ten customers for over 20 years and believe that the strength and tenure of our customer relationships is based on our ability to produce and deliver high-quality products quickly and in the desired volumes for a reasonable price. Our top ten customers together accounted for approximately 35% of our net revenues in the year ended December 31, 2018, and our largest customer, The Home Depot, accounted for approximately 14.2% of our net revenues in the year ended December 31, 2018. 
Competition
The door and window industry is highly competitive and includes a number of regional and international competitors. Competition is largely based on the functional and aesthetic quality of products, service quality, distribution capability and price. We believe that we are well-positioned in our industry due to our leading brands, our broad product lines, our consistently high product quality and service, our global manufacturing and distribution capabilities, and our extensive multi-channel distribution. For North American interior doors, our major competitors include Masonite and several smaller independent door manufacturers. For North American exterior doors, competitors include Masonite, Therma-Tru (a division of Fortune Brands), and Plastpro. The North American window market is highly fragmented, with sizable competitors including Andersen, Pella, Marvin, Ply-Gem (a division of NCI Building Systems), and Milgard (a division of Masco). The door manufacturers that we primarily compete with in our European markets include Huga, Prüm/Garant, Viljandi, Masonite, Keyor, and Herholz. The competitive landscape in Australia is varied across the door and window markets. In the Australian door market, Hume Doors is our primary competitor, while in the window, shower screen, and wardrobe markets we largely compete against a fragmented set of smaller companies. 
Intellectual Property
We rely primarily on patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. Generally, registered trademarks have a perpetual life, provided that they are renewed on a timely basis and continue to be used properly as trademarks. We intend to maintain the trademark registrations listed below so long as they remain valuable to our business. 
13

Back to top

Our U.S. window and door trademarks include JELD-WEN, AuraLast, MiraTEC, Extira, LaCANTINA, Karona, ImpactGard, JW, Aurora, MMI Door, IWP, and ABS. Our trademarks are either registered or have long been used as a common law trademark by the Company. The trademarks we use outside the U.S. include the Stegbar, Regency, William Russell Doors, Airlite, Trend, The Perfect Fit, Aneeta, Breezway, Kolder, Corinthian and A&L marks in Australia, and Swedoor, Dooria, DANA, Mattiovi, Alupan and Domoferm in Europe.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 23,000 people. Of our total number of employees, approximately 11,500 are employed in operations included in our North America segment and corporate operations, approximately 6,700 are employed in operations included in our Europe segment, and approximately 4,800 are employed in operations included in our Australasia segment. 
In total, approximately 1,120, or 10%, of our employees in the U.S. and Canada are unionized. Two facilities in the U.S., representing approximately 350 employees, are covered by collective bargaining agreements. In Canada, approximately 64% of our employees work at facilities covered by collective bargaining agreements. As is common in Europe and Australia, the majority of our facilities are covered by work councils and/or labor agreements. We believe we have satisfactory relationships with our employees and our organized labor unions. 
Environmental Matters
The geographic breadth of our facilities and the nature of our operations subject us to extensive environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations in jurisdictions throughout the world. Such laws and regulations relate to, among other things, air emissions, the treatment and discharge of wastewater, the discharge of hazardous materials into the environment, the handling, storage, use and disposal of solid, hazardous and other wastes, worker health and safety, or otherwise relate to health, safety, and protection of the environment. Many of our products are also subject to various laws and regulations such as building and construction codes, product safety regulations, and regulations and mandates related to energy efficiency. 
The nature of our operations, which involve the handling, storage, use, and disposal of hazardous wastes, exposes us to the risk of liability and claims associated with contamination at our current and former facilities or sites where we have disposed of or arranged for the disposal of waste, or with the impact of our products on human health and safety and the environment. Laws and regulations with respect to the investigation and remediation of contaminated sites can impose joint and several liability for releases or threatened releases of hazardous materials upon statutorily defined parties, including us, regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original activity or disposal. We have been subject to claims, including having been named as a potentially responsible party, in certain proceedings initiated pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or CERCLA, and similar state and foreign laws, regulations, and statutes, and may be named a potentially responsible party in other similar proceedings in the future. Unforeseen expenditures or liabilities may arise in connection with such matters.
We have also been the subject of certain environmental regulatory actions by the EPA and state regulatory agencies in the U.S. and foreign governmental authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate, and are obligated to make certain expenditures in settlement of those actions. We do not expect expenditures for compliance with environmental laws and regulations to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or competitive position. However, the discovery of a presently unknown environmental condition, changes in environmental requirements or their enforcement, or other unanticipated events, may give rise to unforeseen expenditures and liabilities which could be material.
For more information, see Item 1A - Risk Factors - We may be subject to significant compliance costs as well as liabilities under environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, Item 1A - Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry, Item 1A - Risk Factors -We may be subject to significant compliance costs with respect to legislative and regulatory proposals to restrict emissions of GHGs.
Environmental Sustainability
We strive to conduct our business in a manner that is environmentally sustainable and demonstrates environmental stewardship. Toward that end, we pursue processes that are designed to minimize waste, maximize efficient utilization of materials, and conserve resources, including using recycled and reused materials to produce portions of our products. We continue to evaluate and modify our manufacturing and other processes on an ongoing basis to further reduce our impact on the environment. We believe it is important for our employees to share our commitment and we strive to recruit, educate, and train our employees in these values on an ongoing basis throughout their careers with us.

Environmental Regulatory Actions
In 2008, we entered into an Agreed Order with the WADOE, to assess historic environmental contamination and remediation feasibility at our former manufacturing site in Everett, Washington. As part of this agreement, we also agreed to develop a CAP, arising from the feasibility assessment. We are currently working with WADOE to finalize our RI/FS, and, once final, we will develop the CAP. We estimate the remaining cost to complete our RI/FS (Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study), and develop the CAP at $0.5 million, which we have fully accrued. However, because we cannot at this time reasonably estimate the cost associated with any remedial action we would be required to undertake, we have not provided accruals for any remedial actions in our consolidated financial statements.
In 2015, we entered into a COA with the PaDEP to remove a pile of wood fiber waste from our site in Towanda, Pennsylvania, which we acquired in connection with our acquisition of CMI in 2013, by using it as fuel for a boiler at that site. The COA replaced a 1995 Consent Decree between CMI’s predecessor Masonite, Inc. and PaDEP. Under the COA, we are required to achieve certain periodic removal objectives and ultimately remove the entire pile by August 31, 2022. There are currently $11.0 million in bonds posted in connection with these obligations. If we are unable to remove this pile by August 31, 2022, then the bonds will be forfeited and we may be subject to penalties by PaDEP. We currently anticipate meeting all applicable removal deadlines; however, if our operations at this site decrease and we burn less fuel than currently anticipated, we may not be able to meet such deadlines.
