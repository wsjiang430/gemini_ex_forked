Description of our business
We are a designer, manufacturer and marketer of performance-defining products and systems used primarily on bikes, Side-by-Sides, on-road vehicles with and without off-road capabilities, off-road vehicles and trucks, ATVs, snowmobiles, specialty vehicles and applications, motorcycles, and commercial trucks. We believe our products offer innovative design, performance, durability and reliability. Our brand is associated with high-performance and technologically advanced products, by which we generally mean products that provide users with improved control and comfort while riding over rough terrain in varied environments, or providing improved control and responsiveness for on-road only vehicles. We believe that the performance of our products has been demonstrated by, and our brand benefits from, the success of professional athletes who use our products in elite competitive events, such as the Union Cycliste Internationale Mountain Bike World Cup and the X Games. We believe the exposure our products receive when used by successful professional athletes positively influences the purchasing habits of enthusiasts and other consumers seeking high-performance products. We believe that our strategic focus on the performance and racing segments in our markets influences many aspiring and enthusiast consumers who we believe seek to emulate the performance of professional and other elite athletes. We believe our products are generally sold at premium prices, which to us means manufacturer suggested retail sale prices that are generally in the upper quartile of their respective product categories. 
We design our products for, and market our products to, some of the world’s leading cycling and automotive OEMs and to consumers through the aftermarket channel. Many of our OEM customers, including Giant, Santa Cruz Bicycles, Specialized, Scott, Trek, Yeti Cycles and YT in bikes and BRP, Ford, Honda, Jeep, Polaris, Toyota, Triumph, and Yamaha in powered vehicles, are among the market leaders in their respective product categories, and help shape, as well as respond to, consumer trends in their respective categories. We believe that OEMs often prominently display and incorporate our products to improve the marketability and consumer demand for their performance models, which reinforces our brand image. In addition, consumers select our products in the aftermarket channel where we market through a global network of dealers and distributors. 
Industry
We participate in large global markets for bikes and powered vehicles used by recreational and professional users. Today, our products for bicycles are primarily for mountain bikes, road bikes, and e-bikes. Our products for powered vehicles are used primarily on Side-by-Sides, on-road vehicles with and without off-road capabilities, off-road vehicles and trucks, ATVs, snowmobiles, specialty vehicles and applications, motorcycles, and commercial trucks. 
We focus on premium-priced products within each of these categories, which we consider to be the high-end segment because of their higher retail sale prices, where we believe consumers prefer well-designed, performance-oriented equipment. We believe that performance-defining products, which include suspension systems, as well as wheels, cranks, and other components, are critical to the performance of the bikes and powered vehicles in the product categories in which we focus and that technical features, component performance, product design, durability, reliability, and brand recognition strongly influence consumer purchasing decisions.
1

We believe the high-end segments in which we participate are well positioned for growth due to several factors, including: 

• | increasing consumer appetite for performance-defining products;


• | increasing average retail sales prices, which we believe are driven by differentiated and feature-rich products with advanced technologies;


• | continuing product cycle innovation, which we have observed often motivates consumers to upgrade and purchase new products for enhanced performance; and


• | increased sales opportunities for high-end bikes and powered vehicles in international markets.

As vehicles in our end-markets evolve and grow more capable, performance-defining products and systems have become, and we believe will continue to become, increasingly more important for improved performance and control. Additionally, we believe there are opportunities to continue to leverage our technical know-how of suspension products to provide solutions beyond our current applications and end-markets. 
Our competitive strengths 
Broad offering of performance-defining products across multiple consumer markets 
Our performance-defining products enhance vehicle performance across multiple consumer markets. Through the use of adjustable suspension, position sensitive damping, multiple air spring technologies, lightweight and rigid materials, and other technologies and methods, our products improve the performance and control of the vehicles used by our consumers. We believe our reputation for performance-defining products is reinforced by the successful finishes in world class competitive events by athletes incorporating our products in their vehicles. 
Premium brand with strong consumer loyalty 
We believe that we have developed a reputation for performance-defining products and that we own and license established trademarks, such as FOX®, FOX RACING SHOX®, and RACE FACE® which are perceived as premium brands. As such, our performance-defining products are generally sold at premium prices. We take great effort to maintain our brands in the eyes of consumers. For instance, our FOX® logo is prominently displayed on our FOX® branded products used on bikes and powered vehicles sold by our OEM customers, which helps further reinforce our brand image. We believe that our brands have achieved strong loyalty from our consumers. To support our brands, we introduce new products that we believe feature innovative technologies designed to improve vehicle performance and enhance our brand loyalty with consumers. 
Track record of innovation and new product introductions 
Innovation, including new product development, is a key component of our growth strategy. Due to our experience in suspension engineering and design in multiple markets and with a variety of vehicles, solutions we develop for use in one market can ultimately be deployed across multiple markets. For example, we believe that our success in the high-end ATV category led to the widespread adoption of our suspension technology in the Side-by-Side market. Our innovative product development and speed to market are supported by: 

• | our racing culture, including on-site technical race support of professional athletes, which provides us with unique real-time insights as to the evolving performance-defining product needs of those participating in challenging world-class events and is an integral part of our R&D efforts;


• | ongoing research and development through a team of full-time engineers and numerous other technicians and employees who spend at least part of their time testing and using our products and helping develop engineering-based solutions to enhance our product offerings;


• | feedback from professional athletes, race teams, enthusiasts and other consumers who use our products;


• | strategic and collaborative relationships with OEM customers, which furthers our ability to extend technologies and applications across end-markets; and


• | our integrated manufacturing facilities and performance testing center, which allow us to quickly move from concept to product.

 Over the past several years, we have developed multiple new products, such as: 

• | Live Valve, our proprietary semi-active, electronic suspension that processes data from multiple vehicle sensors to adjust the suspension virtually instantaneously to the demands of changing terrain. This technology is currently in use on Side-by-Sides, off-road capable, on-road trucks, and mountain bikes;


• | 32, 34 and 36 Factory Series FLOAT FIT4, which reduces overall fork weight, provides external adjustability with our fourth-generation FOX Isolated Technology (FIT) closed-cartridge damper, and includes the self-adjusting negative chamber air spring for quieter operation and ease of adjustment;

2


• | The GRIP2 fork damper, which is our next-evolution sealed cartridge FIT system, our highest performing gravity-focused damper. GRIP2 shares its roots with the original GRIP architecture, but has been enhanced with all-new technology: four-way adjustability, VVC high-speed rebound circuit, high-performance mid-valve, and overall friction-reducing treatments;


• | X2 technology used in our Factory Series FLOAT and DH rear shocks, which allows the rider to independently tune high- and low-speed compression and high- and low-speed rebound;


• | DPX2 rear shock technology that combines the character of our DPS damping and X2 damping circuits to provide a lightweight trail-tuned adjustable shock;


• | Rhythm series fork products developed to address a lower price point offering without compromising proven FOX performance;


• | PODIUM Internal Bypass, introduced into the Side-by-Side market, which through its internal bypass technology, allows the vehicle to be plush on small bumps and deliver excellent chassis control while providing progressive bottoming resistance with each increment of travel used;


• | X2 technology used in our 2.5 PODIUM shocks for side-by-sides that feature high- and low-speed rebound adjustment, high- and low-speed compression adjustment, and a dual-rate spring for the rear shocks to allow drivers to tune for many different terrain types and driving styles;


• | Race Face Vault Hub, a new 120-point high-engagement mountain bike hubset featuring tool-free end caps that simplify conversion among all major axle standards and is approved for e-bike applications;


• | Race Face Next R31 Carbon Wheels featuring a single spoke length throughout and an offset rim design for improved spoke balance and strength; and


• | Easton EC90 SL Crankset with Cinch Power Meter spindle, a versatile road bike crankset that allows quick conversion between 1x and 2x road and gravel chainring configurations. The Cinch Power Meter spindle, through a one-time connection to a smart phone, automatically works with ride-recording and power-measurement applications.

Strategic brand for OEMs, dealers and distributors 
Through our strategic relationships, we are often sought out by our OEM customers and work closely with them to develop and design new products and product enhancements. We believe our collaborative approach and product development processes strengthen our relationships with our OEM customers. We believe consumers value our branded products when selecting performance bikes and powered vehicles, and as a result, OEMs purchase and incorporate our products in their bikes and powered vehicles in order to increase the sales of their premium-priced products. In addition, we believe the inclusion of our products on high-end bikes and powered vehicles reinforces our premium brand image which helps to drive our sales in the aftermarket channel where dealers and distributors sell our products to consumers. 
Experienced management team 
We have an experienced senior management team led by Larry L. Enterline, our Chief Executive Officer. Many members of our management team and many of our employees are avid users of our products, which further extends their knowledge of, and expertise in, our products and end-markets. We are able to attract and retain highly trained and specialized employees who enhance our Company culture and serve as strong brand advocates. 
Our strategy 
Our goal is to expand our leadership position as a designer, manufacturer and marketer of performance-defining products designed to enhance ride dynamics and performance. We intend to focus on the following key strategies in pursuit of this goal: 
Continue to develop new and innovative products in current end-markets 
We intend to continue to develop and introduce new and innovative products in our current end-markets to improve ride dynamics and performance for our consumers. For example, our patented position-sensitive damping systems provide terrain optimized ride characteristics across many of our product lines. We believe that performance and control are important to our consumer base, and that our frequent introduction of products with innovative and improved technologies increases both OEM and aftermarket demand as consumers seek out products for their vehicles that can deliver these characteristics. We also believe evolving market trends, such as changing bike wheel and tire sizes and increasing adoption rates of off-road capable, on-road trucks should increase demand for vehicles in our end-markets, which, in turn, should increase demand for our suspension products. 
3

Leverage technology and brand to expand into new categories and end-markets 
We believe we have developed a reputation as a leader in performance-defining products and that our reputation combined with our ability to improve vehicle performance by incorporating performance suspension products and other components results in us frequently being approached by OEM product development teams, athletes and others looking to improve the performance of their vehicles, including in end-markets in which we have not previously offered products. We believe our performance-defining technologies have applications in end-markets in which we do not currently participate in a meaningful way, and we intend to selectively develop products for and forge relationships with customers in additional markets. These markets may include military, recreational vehicles (RVs), and "performance street" cars.
Opportunistically expand our business platform through acquisitions 
Over the past several years, we have completed acquisitions which we believe enhance our business and strategically expand our product offerings. In 2014, we acquired the business of Sport Truck, a full-service distributor of aftermarket suspension solutions. Sport Truck designs, markets, and distributes lift kit solutions primarily through its brands, BDS Suspension and Zone Offroad Products. In 2014, we also acquired the businesses of Race Face/Easton. Known for its unique carbon technology, Race Face/Easton designs, manufactures, and distributes performance bike wheels and other performance cycling components including cranks, bars, stems, and seat posts, globally to OEMs and the aftermarket. In 2015, we continued to expand our opportunities through the acquisition of certain assets of Marzocchi’s bike product lines. In November 2017, through our subsidiary FF U.S. Holding Corp. d/b/a ("Tuscany") we acquired the majority interest in the business of Flagship, Inc., a designer, manufacturer and distributor of premium aftermarket powered vehicle performance packages and personal-use specialty vehicles based on OEM vehicle chassis. The Company believes that this acquisition will accelerate the growth of its off-road and on-road truck products.
We also believe that our passionate customer base has a desire for other types of performance products beyond those that attach to a vehicle or bike. We believe there is opportunity to expand our total available market by broadening our acquisition focus to include a more diverse range of performance products that add to or increase our customers' enjoyment of their activities of choice.
Our business development group is responsible for identifying and assessing inorganic and organic potential growth opportunities of our ride dynamics platform and other specialty sports technology platforms. Specifically, our business development group: (i) identifies and assesses potential acquisition opportunities; (ii) aids the business in analyzing growth alternatives; and (iii) manages critical projects and programs as determined by senior management. 
Increase our aftermarket penetration 
We currently have a broad aftermarket distribution network of thousands of retail dealers and distributors worldwide. We intend to further penetrate the aftermarket channel by selectively adding dealers and distributors in certain geographic markets, increasing our internal sales force and strategically expanding aftermarket-specific products and services to existing vehicle platforms.
Accelerate international growth 
While a significant percentage of our current sales are to OEMs and dealers and distributors located outside the United States, we believe international expansion represents a significant opportunity for us and we have, and intend to continue to, selectively increase infrastructure investments and focus on identified geographic regions. We believe that rising consumer discretionary income in a number of developing markets and increasing consumer preferences for premium, performance bikes and powered vehicles should contribute to increasing demand for our products. In addition, we believe increasing international viewership of racing and extreme sports and other outdoor events, such as the X Games, is contributing to the growth of international participation in activities in which our products are used. We intend to leverage the recognition of our brands to capitalize on these trends by globally increasing our sales to both OEMs and dealers and distributors, particularly in markets where we perceive significant opportunities. 
Improve operating and supply chain efficiencies 
During 2017, we completed the process of moving all bike suspension component manufacturing to our facility in Taichung, Taiwan. In connection with this move, we are using, and expect to continue to use, suppliers that are located closer to our Taichung, Taiwan facility for a number of materials and components. This transition has shortened production lead times to our bike OEM customers, improved supply chain efficiencies, and reduced manufacturing costs. With the transition of all of our bike suspension component manufacturing to Taichung, Taiwan, we have converted the Watsonville manufacturing facility to exclusively manufacture powered vehicle suspension products. We are currently pursuing a number of initiatives to improve efficiencies and achieve cost savings across our North American manufacturing locations including expanding our Powered Vehicles Group manufacturing operations in Hall County, Georgia and relocating our Specialty Sports Group’s U.S. aftermarket bike products distribution, sales, service operations to Reno, Nevada.

Seasonality 
Certain portions of our business are seasonal; we believe this seasonality is due to the delivery of new products. Generally, our quarterly sales have been the lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter of the year. For example, our sales in our first and third quarters of 2018 represented 21% and 28% of our total sales for the year, respectively. 
Competition 
The markets for performance-defining products, including suspension components, wheels, and cranks, are highly competitive. We compete with other companies that produce products for sale to OEMs, dealers and distributors, as well as with OEMs which produce their own line of products for their own use. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, research and development or marketing resources than we do. Competition in the high-end segment of the performance-defining market revolves around technical features, performance, product design, innovation, reliability and durability, brand, time to market, customer service and reliable order execution. While the pricing of competing products is always a factor, we believe the performance of our products helps justify our premium pricing. Within our markets, we compete with several large companies and numerous small companies that provide branded and unbranded products across many of our product lines. These competitors can be divided into the following categories: 
Powered Vehicles 
Within the market for powered vehicle suspension components, we compete with several companies in different submarkets. In the snowmobile market we compete with KYB (Kayaba Industry Co., Ltd.), Öhlins Racing AB (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tenneco), Walker Evans Racing, Works Performance Products, Inc., and Penske Racing Shocks / Custom Axis, Inc. In the ATV and Side-by-Side markets, outside of vertically-integrated OEMs, we compete with ZF Sachs (ZF Friedrichshafen AG), Polaris, and Walker Evans Racing for OEM business and Elka Suspension Inc., Öhlins Racing AB, Works Performance Products, and Penske Racing Shocks / Custom Axis, Inc. for aftermarket business. 
Within the market for off-road and specialty vehicle suspension components, we compete with ThyssenKrupp Bilstein Suspension GmbH (commonly known as Bilstein), and King Shock Technology, Inc. (commonly known as King Shocks), Icon Vehicle Dynamics, Sway-A-Way, Pro Comp USA Suspension, and Rancho (Tenneco).

Our products 
We design and manufacture performance-defining products, of which a significant portion is suspension products. These suspension products dissipate the energy and force generated by bikes and powered vehicles while they are in motion. Suspension products allow wheels or skis (in the case of snowmobiles) to move up and down to absorb bumps and shocks while maintaining contact with the ground for better control. Our products use adjustable suspension, position-sensitive damping, electronically controllable damping, multiple air spring technologies, low weight and structural rigidity, all of which improve user control for greater performance. 
We use high-grade materials in our products and have developed a number of sophisticated assembly processes to maintain quality across all product lines. Our suspension products are assembled according to precise specifications throughout the assembly process to create consistently high-performance levels and customer satisfaction. 
Powered Vehicles 
In our powered vehicle product categories, we offer premium products under the FOX, BDS Suspension, Zone Offroad, JKS Manufacturing, RT Pro UTV, 4x4 Posi-Lok, and Tuscany brands for Side-by-Sides, on-road vehicles with and without off-road capabilities, off-road vehicles and trucks, ATVs, snowmobiles, specialty vehicles and applications, motorcycles, and commercial trucks. In each of the years ended December 28, 2018, December 29, 2017 and December 30, 2016, approximately 54%, 48% and 44%, respectively, of our sales were attributable to sales of powered vehicles related products.

Products for these vehicles are designed for use on roads, for trail riding, in racing, and to help provide performance and comfort. Our products have also been used on limited quantities of off-road military vehicles and other small-scale select military applications. Our aftermarket truck suspension component products in the powered vehicles category range from two-inch aluminum bolt-on shocks to our patented position sensitive internal bypass shocks. We also offer lift kits and components with our shock products and aftermarket accessory packages for use in trucks. In addition, we up-fit trucks to be off-road capable, on-road vehicles with components and products such as lift kits, shock products, superchargers, interior accessories, wheel, tires, lighting, and body enhancements. 
Specialty Sports
As a result of our acquisitions in recent years, our bike product offerings have expanded and are used on a wide range of performance mountain bikes and road bikes under the FOX, Race Face, Easton Cycling and Marzocchi brands. Given this wide range of bike products and brands, as well as the potential to expand our offerings to include other types of performance-defining products, we have changed the name of the group from Bike Division to Specialty Sports Group. In each of the years ended December 28, 2018, December 29, 2017 and December 30, 2016, approximately 46%, 52% and 56%, respectively, of our sales were attributable to sales of bike-related products. Primarily for the mountain bike market, we offer mid-end and high-end front fork and rear suspension products designed for cross-country, trail, all-mountain, free-ride and downhill riding. Our mountain bike suspension products are sold in four series and under the Marzocchi brand: (i) our Marzocchi BOMBER series, designed for a rider who values ease of use over adjustability (ii) our FOX Rhythm series, designed to provide FOX performance at the entry price point of the high-end mountain bikes segment (iii) our FOX Performance series, designed for demanding enthusiasts; (iv) our FOX Performance Elite series, designed for experienced and expert riders; and (v) our FOX Factory series, designed for maximum performance at a professional level.
We also offer mountain and road bike wheels and other performance-defining cycling components under the Race Face and Easton Cycling brands including cranks, chainrings, pedals, bars, stems, and seat posts.
Research and development 
Research and development is at the core of our product innovation and market leadership strategy. We have a growing team of engineers and technicians focused on designing innovative products and developing engineering-based solutions to enhance our product offerings. In addition, a large number of our other employees, many of whom use our products in their recreational activities, contribute to our research and development and product innovation initiatives. Their involvement in the development of new products ranges from participating in initial brainstorming sessions to test riding products in development. Product development also includes collaborating with OEM customers across end-markets, field testing by professional athletes and sponsored race teams and working with enthusiasts and other users of our products. This feedback helps us to develop innovative products which meet our demanding standards as well as the evolving needs of professional and recreational end users and to quickly commercialize these products. 
Our research and development activities are supported by state-of-the-art engineering software design tools, integrated manufacturing facilities and a performance testing center equipped to enhance product safety, durability and performance. Our testing center collects data and tests products prior to and after commercial introduction. Suspension products undergo a variety of rigorous performance and accelerated life tests before they are introduced into the market. Research and development expense totaled approximately $25.8 million, $20.2 million and $18.5 million in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
Intellectual property 
Intellectual property is an important aspect of our business. We rely upon a combination of patents, trademarks, trade names, licensing arrangements, trade secrets, know-how and proprietary technology and we secure and protect our intellectual property rights. 
Our intellectual property counsel diligently protects our new technologies with patents and trademarks and defends against patent infringement allegations. We patent our proprietary technologies related to vehicle suspension and other products in the U.S. and various foreign patent offices. Our principal intellectual property also includes our registered trademarks in the U.S. and a number of international jurisdictions, including the marks FOX®, FOX RACING SHOX® and REDEFINE YOUR LIMITS®. Although our intellectual property is important to our business operations and constitutes a valuable asset in the aggregate, we do not believe that any single patent, trademark or trade secret is critical to the success of our business as a whole. We cannot be certain that our patent applications will be issued or that any issued patents will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties. 
In addition to the foregoing protections, we generally control access to and use of our proprietary and other confidential information using internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, OEMs, distributors and others.

Customers 
Our OEM customers include market leaders in their respective categories, and they help define, as well as respond to, consumer trends in their respective industries. These OEM customers include our products on a number of their performance models. We believe OEMs often use our products to improve the marketability and demand of their own products, which, in turn, strengthens our brand image. In addition, consumers select our performance-defining products in the aftermarket channel, where we market through a global network of dealers and distributors. We currently sell to more than 200 OEMs and distribute our products to more than 5,000 retail dealers and distributors worldwide. In 2018, 60% of our sales resulted from sales to OEM customers and 40% resulted from sales to dealers and distributors for resale in the aftermarket channel. No material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the U.S. government.
Sales attributable to our 10 largest OEM customers, which can vary from year-to-year, collectively accounted for approximately 43%, 42% and 42% of our sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016. 
Although we refer to the branded bike OEMs that use our products throughout this document as "our customers," "our OEM customers" or "our bike OEM customers," branded bike OEMs often use contract manufacturers to manufacture and assemble their bikes. As a result, even though we typically negotiate price and volume requirements directly with our bike OEM customers, it is the contract manufacturer that may place the purchase order and therefore assumes the payment responsibilities. 
Our North American sales totaled $388.7 million, $280.9 million and $221.3 million, or 63%, 59% and 55% of our total sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Sales outside of North America totaled $230.5 million, $194.8 million and $181.8 million or 37%, 41% and 45% of our total sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Sales attributable to countries outside the United States are based on shipment location. Our international sales, however, do not necessarily reflect the location of the end users of our products, as many of our products are incorporated into bikes and powered vehicles that are assembled at international locations and then shipped back to the United States. Additional information about our product revenues and certain geographical information is available in Note 2 - Revenues, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Additional information regarding our sales, income, and total assets is available in Item 6. "Selected Financial Information." 
Powered Vehicles 
We sell our powered vehicle-suspension products to OEMs, including Arctic Cat, BRP, Ford, Honda, Jeep, Polaris, Toyota, Triumph and Yamaha. We also are continually nurturing and developing relationships with our existing and new OEMs, as the powered vehicles market continues to grow. After incorporating our products on their powered vehicles, OEMs typically sell their powered vehicles to independent dealers, which then sell directly to consumers. 
In the aftermarket, we typically sell to dealers and distributors, both domestically and internationally. Our dealers sell directly to consumers. When we sell to our distributors, they sell to independent dealers, which then sell directly to consumers. 
Specialty Sports
We sell our bike suspension and components products to a broad network of domestic and international bike OEMs, including Canyon, Giant, Santa Cruz Bicycles, Scott, Specialized, Trek, Yeti Cycles and YT. We have long-standing relationships with many of the top bike OEMs. After incorporating our products on their bikes, OEMs typically sell their bikes to independent dealers, which then sell directly to consumers. 
In the aftermarket, we typically sell to U.S. dealers and through distributors internationally. Our dealers sell directly to aftermarket consumers. Our overseas distributors sell to independent dealers, which then sell directly to consumers. 
Sales and marketing 
We employ specialized and dedicated sales professionals. Each sales professional is fully responsible for servicing either OEM or aftermarket customers within our product categories, which ensures that our customers are in contact with capable and knowledgeable sales professionals to address their specific needs. We strongly believe that providing a high level of service to our end customers is essential to maintaining our reputational excellence in the marketplace. Our sales professionals receive training on the brands' latest products and technologies and attend trade shows and events to increase their market knowledge. 
Our marketing strategy focuses on strengthening and promoting our brands in the marketplace. We strategically focus our marketing efforts on enthusiasts seeking high-end, performance-defining products and systems through promotions at destination riding locations and individual and team sponsorships. We believe the performance of our products has been demonstrated by, and our brands benefit from, the success of professional athletes who use our products in elite competitive events such as the Union Cycliste Internationale Mountain Bike World Cup and the X Games. We also believe these successes positively influence the purchasing habits of enthusiasts and other consumers seeking performance-defining products. 
7

We believe that our strategic focus on the performance and racing segments in our markets, including our sponsorships of a number of professional athletes and race teams, influences many aspiring and enthusiast consumers and enables our products to be sold at premium price points. In order to continue to enhance our brand image, we will need to maintain our position in the suspension products industry and to continue to provide high-quality products and services. 
We have also been able to develop long-term strategic relationships with leading OEMs. Our reputation for performance-defining products plays a critical role in our aftermarket sales to consumers. 
In addition to our website and traditional marketing channels, such as print advertising and tradeshows, we maintain an active social media presence, including an Instagram feed, Facebook page, YouTube channel, Vimeo channel and Twitter feed to increase brand awareness, foster loyalty and build a community of users. As strategies and marketing plans are developed for our products, our internal marketing and communications group works to ensure brand cohesion and consistency. 
Manufacturing and backlog
We manufacture and complete final assembly on most of our products. By controlling the manufacturing process of our products, we can maintain our strict quality standards, customize our machines and processes for the specific requirements of our products, and quickly respond to feedback we receive on our products in development and otherwise. Furthermore, manufacturing our own products enables us to adjust our labor and production inputs to meet seasonal demands and the customized requirements of some of our customers. 
During 2018, we moved our corporate headquarters from Scotts Valley, California to our offices in Braselton, Georgia. We also purchased a 23-acre site in Hall County, Georgia to diversify our manufacturing platform and provide additional long-term capacity to support growth in our Powered Vehicles Group. The first phase of the Hall County, Georgia project is expected to be completed in early 2020 and will be used for manufacturing, warehousing, distribution and office space. Our Scotts Valley, California location will remain an essential shared services facility housing certain corporate functions.
In addition, we are also in the process of relocating our aftermarket bike products distribution, sales and service operations from Watsonville and Scotts Valley, California to Reno, Nevada to better serve our customers.
We had approximately $72.9 million and $45.6 million in firm backlog orders at December 28, 2018 and December 29, 2017, respectively. The increase in 2018 backlog, as compared to 2017, was due to normal growth in the business and changes in the seasonality of order placement.
Suppliers and raw materials
The primary raw materials used in the production of our products are aluminum, magnesium, carbon and steel. We generally use multiple suppliers for our raw materials and believe that our raw materials are in adequate supply and available from many suppliers at competitive prices. Prices for our raw materials fluctuate from time to time, but historically, price fluctuations have not had a material impact on our business. 
We work closely with our supply base, and depend upon certain suppliers to provide raw inputs, such as forgings, castings and molded polymers that have been optimized for weight, structural integrity, wear and cost. In certain circumstances, we depend upon a limited number of suppliers for such raw inputs. We typically have no firm contractual sourcing agreements with our suppliers other than purchase orders. 
Miyaki is the exclusive producer of the Kashima coating for our suspension component tubes. As part of our agreement with Miyaki, or the Kashima Agreement, we have been granted the exclusive right to use the trademark "KASHIMACOAT" on products comprising the aluminum finished parts for suspension components (e.g., tubes) and on related sales and marketing material worldwide, subject to a minimum model year order and certain other exclusions.

Government regulation 
Environmental 
Our manufacturing operations, facilities and properties in the United States, Canada and Taiwan are subject to evolving foreign, international, federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing air emissions, wastewater discharge and the storage and handling of chemicals and hazardous substances. If we fail to comply with such laws and regulations, we could be subject to significant fines, penalties, costs, liabilities or restrictions on operations, which could negatively affect our financial condition. 
We believe that our operations are in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations, and our compliance with such laws and regulations has not had, nor is it expected to have, a material impact on our earnings or competitive position. However, new requirements, more stringent application of existing requirements or the discovery of previously unknown environmental conditions could result in material environmental related expenditures in the future. 
Employment 
We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local government laws and regulations governing our relationships with our employees, including those relating to minimum wage, overtime, working conditions, hiring and firing, non-discrimination, work permits and employee benefits. We believe that our operations are conducted in compliance, in all material respects, with such laws and regulations. We have never experienced a material work stoppage or disruption to our business relating to employee matters. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good. 
Consumer safety 
We are subject to the jurisdiction of the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission, or the CPSC, and other federal, state and foreign regulatory bodies including the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which enforces the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. Under CPSC regulations, a manufacturer of consumer goods is obligated to notify the CPSC, if, among other things, the manufacturer becomes aware that one of its products has a defect that could create a substantial risk of injury. If the manufacturer has not already undertaken to do so, the CPSC may require a manufacturer to recall a product, which may involve product repair, replacement or refund. During the past three years, we initiated two voluntary product recalls. For additional information, see Item 1A."Risk Factors" below.
Government contracts 
No material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the U.S. government. 
Financial information about segments and geographic Areas
