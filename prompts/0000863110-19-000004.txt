ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General Information
 
Artesian Resources Corporation, or Artesian Resources, is a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1927, that operates as the holding company of nine wholly-owned subsidiaries offering water, wastewater and other services in Delaware, Maryland and Pennsylvania.  The Company’s principal executive offices are located at 664 Churchmans Road, Newark, Delaware 19702.  Our principal subsidiary, Artesian Water Company, Inc., is the oldest and largest investor-owned public water utility on the Delmarva Peninsula, and has been providing superior water service since 1905.  We distribute and sell water, including water for public and private fire protection, to residential, commercial, industrial, municipal and utility customers in the states of Delaware, Maryland and Pennsylvania.  We provide wastewater services to customers in Delaware. In addition, we provide contract water and wastewater operations, and water, sewer and internal Service Line Protection Plans. Our Class A Non-Voting Common Stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and trades under the symbol "ARTNA."  Our Class B Common Stock trades on the NASDAQ's OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol “ARTNB.”
 
Artesian Resources operates as the parent holding company of five regulated public utilities: Artesian Water Company, Inc., or Artesian Water, Artesian Water Pennsylvania, Inc., or Artesian Water Pennsylvania, Artesian Water Maryland, Inc., or Artesian Water Maryland, Artesian Wastewater Management, Inc., or Artesian Wastewater, and Artesian Wastewater Maryland, Inc., or Artesian Wastewater Maryland; and four non-regulated subsidiaries: Artesian Utility Development, Inc., or Artesian Utility, Artesian Development Corporation, or Artesian Development, Artesian Storm Water Services, Inc., or Artesian Storm Water, and Artesian Consulting Engineers, Inc., or Artesian Consulting Engineers.  The terms "we," "our," “Artesian,” and the "Company" as used herein refer to Artesian Resources and its subsidiaries.  The business activity conducted by each of our subsidiaries is discussed below under separate headings.
 
Our Market
 
Our current market area is the Delmarva Peninsula.  Our largest service area is in the State of Delaware.  Substantial portions of Delaware, particularly outside of northern New Castle County, are not served by a public water or wastewater system and represent potential opportunities for Artesian Water and Artesian Wastewater to obtain new exclusive franchised service areas. We continue to focus resources on developing and serving existing service territories and obtaining new territories throughout Delaware.
 
We hold Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity, or CPCNs, for approximately 285 square miles of exclusive water service territory, most of which is in Delaware and some in Maryland and Pennsylvania.  We hold CPCN’s for approximately 26 square miles of wastewater service territory located in Sussex County, Delaware.  Our largest connected regional water system, consisting of approximately 141 square miles and 76,000 metered customers, is located in northern New Castle County and portions of southern New Castle County, Delaware.  A significant portion of our exclusive service territory is in Sussex County, Delaware and remains undeveloped, and if and when development occurs and there is population growth in these areas, we will increase our customer base by providing water and/or wastewater service to the newly developed areas and new customers.
 
Subsidiaries
 
Artesian Water
 
Artesian Water, our principal subsidiary, is the oldest and largest public water utility in the State of Delaware and has been providing water service within the state since 1905.  Artesian Water distributes and sells water to residential, commercial, industrial, governmental, municipal and utility customers throughout the State of Delaware.  In addition, Artesian Water provides services to other water utilities, including operations and billing functions, and has contract operation agreements with private and municipal water providers.  We also provide water for public and private fire protection to customers in our service territories.  Artesian Water produced approximately 90% of our 2018 consolidated operating revenues.
 
We derive about 95% of our self-supplied groundwater from wells that pump groundwater from aquifers and other formations located in the Atlantic Coastal Plain.  The remaining 5% of our groundwater supply comes from wells in the Piedmont Province.  We use a variety of treatment methods, including aeration, pH adjustment, chlorination, fluoridation, ultra violet oxidation, arsenic removal, nitrate removal, radium removal, iron removal, and carbon adsorption to meet federal, state and local water quality standards.  Additionally, a corrosion inhibitor is added to all of our self-supplied groundwater and most of the supply from interconnections.  We have 54 different water treatment facilities in our Delaware systems.  All water supplies that we purchase from neighboring utilities are potable.

To supplement our groundwater supply, we purchase treated surface water through interconnections only in the northern service area of our New Castle County, Delaware system.  The treated surface water is blended with our groundwater supply for distribution to our customers.  Nearly 85% of the overall 7.9 billion gallons of water we distributed in all of our Delaware systems during 2018 came from our groundwater wells, while the remaining 15% came from interconnections with other utilities and municipalities.  In Delaware in 2018, we pumped an average of 18.5 million gallons per day, or mgd, from our groundwater wells and obtained an average of approximately 3.2 mgd from interconnections.  Our peak water supply capacity currently is approximately 55.0 mgd.  
 
Most of our New Castle County, Delaware water system is interconnected.  In the remainder of the State of Delaware, we have several satellite systems that have not yet been connected by transmission and distribution facilities.  We intend to join these systems into larger integrated regional systems through the construction of a transmission and distribution network as development continues and our expansion efforts provide us with contiguous exclusive service territories.
 
In Delaware, we have 22 interconnections with two neighboring water utilities and six municipalities that provide us with the ability to purchase or sell water.  An interconnection agreement with the Chester Water Authority has a "take or pay" clause requiring us to purchase 1.095 billion gallons annually.  During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, we used the minimum draw under this agreement.  The Chester Water Authority agreement, which expires December 31, 2021, provides for the right to extend the term of this agreement through and including December 31, 2047, at our option, subject to the approval of the Susquehanna River Basin Commission. All of the interconnections provide Artesian Water the ability to sell water to neighboring water utilities or municipalities.  Artesian Water also has an interconnection with the Town of Chesapeake City that provides the town approximately 85,000 gallons per day on average.  The interconnection is currently the town’s sole source of water supply.
 
As of December 31, 2018, we were serving customers through approximately 1,311 miles of transmission and distribution mains.  Mains range in diameter from two inches to twenty-four inches, and most of the mains are made of ductile iron or cast iron.
 
We have 29 storage tanks in Delaware, most of which are elevated, providing total system storage of 42 million gallons. We have developed and are using an Aquifer Storage and Recovery, or ASR, system in New Castle County, Delaware.  Our ASR system provides approximately 130 million gallons of storage capacity, which can be withdrawn at an average rate of approximately 1 mgd.  At some locations, we rely on hydropneumatic tanks to maintain adequate system pressures.  Where possible, we combine our smaller satellite systems with systems having elevated storage facilities.
 
Artesian Water Maryland
 
Artesian Water Maryland began operations in August 2007.  Artesian Water Maryland distributes and sells water to residential, commercial, industrial and municipal customers in Cecil County, Maryland.  Artesian Water Maryland owns and operates 8 public water systems including one in Port Deposit that has the ability to supply up to 1 mgd of water through an intake in the Susquehanna River.
 
The majority of the 0.1 billion gallons of water we distributed in all of our Maryland systems during 2018 came from our groundwater wells, while a portion came from treated surface water.  We have eight separate water treatment facilities in our Maryland systems.  We have one water treatment facility that treats surface water from the Susquehanna River, located in Cecil County, Maryland.  Our peak water supply capacity currently is approximately 2.0 mgd.  We have 7 storage tanks capable of storing approximately 2.4 million gallons.  We believe that we have in place sufficient capacity to provide water service for the foreseeable future to all existing and new customers in all of our service territories.
 
In Maryland, we have one interconnection that connects the Artesian Water system in Delaware to the Meadowview System, one interconnection with a neighboring utility, and three interconnections with the Town of Elkton.  The interconnection with the Artesian Water Delaware system is capable of providing up to 3.0 mgd of water to our Maryland systems, of which 1.5 mgd is available to the Town of Elkton per our agreement with the town.
 
In January 2018, Artesian Water Maryland signed an interconnection agreement with the Town of North East that has a “take or pay” clause requiring us to purchase a minimum of 35,000 gallons per day, commencing on the first day of the month following the date on which the interconnection is completed.  The interconnection was completed in the first quarter of 2019.
 
Artesian Water Pennsylvania
 
Artesian Water Pennsylvania began operations in 2002.  It provides water service to a residential community in Chester County, Pennsylvania.

Artesian Wastewater
 
Artesian Wastewater is a regulated entity that owns wastewater collection and treatment infrastructure and provides wastewater services to customers in Delaware as a regulated public wastewater service company.  Artesian Wastewater owns and operates four wastewater treatment facilities, which are permitted to treat approximately 500,000 gallons per day.  Artesian Wastewater and Sussex County, a political subdivision of Delaware, provide reciprocal services to address the periodic need of each for additional wastewater treatment and disposal capacity in certain service areas within Sussex County.  There are numerous locations in Sussex County where Artesian Wastewater’s and Sussex County’s facilities are capable of being connected or integrated to allow for the movement and disposal of wastewater generated by one or the other’s system in a manner that most efficiently and cost effectively manages wastewater transmission, treatment and disposal. 
Artesian Wastewater Maryland
 
 Artesian Wastewater Maryland was incorporated on June 3, 2008 and is able to provide regulated wastewater services to customers in the State of Maryland.  It is currently not providing these services in Maryland.
Artesian Utility
 
Artesian Utility was formed in 1996 and designs and builds water and wastewater infrastructure and provides contract water and wastewater operation services on the Delmarva Peninsula to private, municipal and governmental institutions.  Artesian Utility also evaluates land parcels, provides recommendations to developers on the size of water or wastewater facilities and the type of technology that should be used for treatment at such facilities, and operates water and wastewater facilities in Delaware for municipal and governmental organizations.  Artesian Utility also contracts with developers for design and construction of wastewater facilities within the Delmarva Peninsula, using a number of different technologies for treatment of wastewater at each facility.  In addition, as further discussed below, Artesian Utility operates the Water Service Line Protection Plan, or WSLP Plan, the Sewer Service Line Protection Plan, or SSLP Plan, and the Internal Service Line Protection Plan, or ISLP Plan.
 
Artesian Utility currently operates wastewater treatment facilities for the town of Middletown, in southern New Castle County, Delaware, or Middletown, under a 20-year contract that expires in July 2022.  The facilities include two wastewater treatment stations with capacities of up to approximately 2.5 mgd and 250,000 gallons per day, respectively.  We also operate a wastewater disposal facility in Middletown in order to support the 2.5 mgd wastewater facility.  One of the wastewater treatment facilities in Middletown now provides reclaimed wastewater for use in spray irrigation on public and agricultural lands in the area.
 
Artesian Utility also offers three protection plans to customers, the WSLP Plan, the SSLP Plan, and the ISLP Plan.  The WSLP Plan covers all parts, material and labor required to repair or replace participating customers' leaking water service lines up to an annual limit. The SSLP Plan covers all parts, material and labor required to repair or replace participating customers' leaking or clogged sewer lines up to an annual limit.  The ISLP Plan enhances available coverage to include water and wastewater lines within customers' residences.

Regulatory Matters
 
Overview
 
Our water and wastewater utility operations are subject to regulation by their respective state regulatory commissions, which have broad administrative power and authority to regulate rates charged for service, determine franchise areas and conditions of service, approve acquisitions, authorize the issuance of securities and other matters.  The profitability of our utility operations is influenced, to a great extent, by the timeliness and adequacy of regulatory relief we are granted by the respective regulatory commissions or authorities in the states in which we operate.  See Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of recent regulatory proceedings.
Service Territory Expansion
 
In Delaware, a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity, or CPCN, grants a water or wastewater company the exclusive right to serve all existing and new customers within a designated area.  The Delaware Public Service Commission, or DEPSC, has the authority to issue and revoke these CPCNs.  In this Form 10-K, we may refer to CPCNs as "franchises" or "service territories."
 
For a water company, the DEPSC may grant a CPCN under circumstances where there has been a determination that the water in the proposed service area does not meet the regulations governing drinking water standards of the State Division of Public Health for human consumption or where the supply is insufficient to meet the projected demand.  For a wastewater company, the DEPSC has jurisdiction over non-governmental wastewater utilities having fifty or more customers in the aggregate.  A CPCN for water and wastewater utilities shall be granted by the DEPSC to applicants in possession of one of the following:
 
 
- | a signed service agreement with the developer of a proposed subdivision or development, which subdivision or development has been duly approved by the respective county government; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | a petition requesting such service signed by a majority of the landowners of the proposed territory to be served; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | a duly certified copy of a resolution from the governing body of a county or municipality requesting the applicant to provide service to the proposed territory to be served. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



CPCNs are not transferable.  A water or wastewater utility that has a CPCN must obtain the approval of the DEPSC to abandon a service territory.  Once a CPCN is granted to a water or wastewater utility, it may not be suspended or terminated unless the DEPSC determines in accordance with its rules and regulations that good cause exists for any such suspension or termination.  Although we have been granted an exclusive franchise for each of our existing water and wastewater systems in Delaware, our ability to expand service areas can be affected by the DEPSC awarding franchises to other regulated water or wastewater utilities with whom we compete for such franchises.
 
In Maryland, the Company must obtain approval from the appropriate local government authority for the ability to serve a particular area and also ensure that the acquired area is in the county’s master water and sewer plan.  The authority to exercise a franchise must then be obtained from the Maryland Public Service Commission, or MDPSC.  Utilities that seek to develop a franchise by constructing new facilities must obtain appropriate approvals from the Maryland Department of the Environment, the local government and the MDPSC.  The utility must also obtain approval for soil and erosion plans and easement agreements from appropriate parties.
 
Environmental Regulation
 
Our water and wastewater operations are subject to federal, state, and local requirements relating to environmental protection.  The United States Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA, the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, or DNREC, and the Delaware Division of Public Health, or DPH, regulate the water quality of our treatment and distribution systems in Delaware, as do the EPA and the Maryland Department of the Environment, or MDE, with respect to our operations in Maryland.  The Chester Water Authority, which supplies water to Artesian Water through an interconnection in northern New Castle County, is regulated by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, as well as the EPA.  We believe that we are in material compliance with all current federal, state and local water quality standards, including regulations under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act. However, if new water quality regulations are too costly, or if we fail to comply with such regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
 
The water industry is capital intensive, with one of the highest levels of capital investment in plant and equipment per dollar of revenue among all utilities.  Increasingly stringent drinking water regulations to meet the requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act have required the water industry to invest in more advanced treatment systems and processes, which require a heightened level of expertise.  Significant enhancements were made to existing facilities to effectively treat and remove compounds as required by government agencies, such as ultra violet oxidation treatment, ceramic membrane filtration and carbon filtration.  We are currently in full compliance with the requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act.  Even though our water utility was founded in 1905, the majority of our investment in infrastructure occurred in the last 40 years.
 
Under Delaware state laws and regulations, we are required to file applications with DNREC for water allocation permits for each of our operating wells pumping greater than 50,000 gallons per day.  For any wells in the Delaware River Basin, we must also file allocation permits with the Delaware River Basin Commission, or DRBC.  We have 124 operating and 60 observation and monitoring wells in our Delaware systems.  At December 31, 2018, we had allocation permits for 104 wells and 20 wells that do not require a permit.

Our access to aquifers within our service territory is not exclusive.  Water allocation permits control the amount of water that can be drawn from water resources and are granted with specific restrictions on water level draw down limits, annual, monthly and daily pumpage limits, and well field allocation pumpage limits.  We are also subject to water allocation regulations that control the amount of water that we can draw from water sources.  As a result, if new or more restrictive water allocation regulations are imposed, they could have an adverse effect on our ability to supply the demands of our customers, and in turn, our water supply revenues and results of operations.  Our ability to supply the demands of our customers historically has not been affected by private usage of the aquifers by landowners or the limits imposed by the state of Delaware. Because of the extensive regulatory requirements relating to the withdrawal of any significant amounts of water from the aquifers, we believe that third party usage of the aquifers within our service territory will not interfere with our ability to meet the present and future demands of our customers.
 
As required by the Safe Drinking Water Act, the EPA has established maximum contaminant levels for various substances found in drinking water to ensure that the water is safe for human consumption.  These limits are known as Maximum Contaminant Levels and Maximum Residual Disinfection Levels.  The EPA also regulates how often public water systems monitor their water for contaminants and report the monitoring results to the individual state agencies or the EPA.  Generally, the larger the population served by a water system, the more frequent the monitoring and reporting requirements.  The Safe Drinking Water Act applies to all 50 states.
 
The DPH has set maximum contaminant levels for certain substances that are more restrictive than the maximum contaminant levels set by the EPA.  The DPH is the EPA's agent for enforcing the Safe Drinking Water Act in Delaware and, in that capacity, monitors the activities of Artesian Water and reviews the results of water quality tests performed by Artesian Water for adherence to applicable regulations.  Artesian Water is also subject to other laws regulating substances and contaminants in water, including rules for volatile organic compounds and the Total Coliform Rule.
 
A normal by-product of our iron removal treatment facilities is a solid consisting of the iron removed from untreated groundwater plus residue from chemicals used in the treatment process.  The solids produced at our facilities are either disposed directly into approved wastewater facilities or removed from our facilities by a licensed third party vendor.  A normal by-product of our carbon adsorption filtration process is exhausted carbon media, which is disposed of by the contractor providing the media replacement.  Management believes that compliance with existing federal, state or local laws and regulations regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, has no material effect upon the business and affairs of the Company, but there is no assurance that such compliance will continue to not have a material effect in the future.
 
The MDE ensures that water quality and quantity at all public water systems in Maryland meet the needs of the public and are in compliance with federal and state regulations. The MDE also ensures that public drinking water systems provide safe and adequate water to all current and future users in Maryland, and that appropriate usage, planning, and conservation policies are implemented for Maryland’s water resources. The MDE oversees the development of Source Water Assessments for water supplies and issues water appropriation permits for public drinking water systems.  In order to appropriate water for municipal, commercial, industrial or other non-domestic uses, a Water Appropriation Permit must be obtained.  Issuance of the permit involves evaluating the needs of the user and the potential impact of the withdrawal on neighboring users and the water source in order to maximize beneficial use of the water.  Permits for large appropriations often involve conducting pump tests to measure adequacy of an aquifer and safe yield of a well, or reviewing stream flow records to determine the adequacy of a surface water source.  Regulations require all new community water systems to have sufficient technical, managerial and financial capacity to provide safe drinking water to their consumers prior to being issued a Construction Permit.  Also, capacity management guidance contains capacity limiting factors that can include, source capacity, treatment capacity and appropriation permit quantity.  The quantity of water withdrawn from the Port Deposit surface water intake is allocated by the Susquehanna River Basin Commission, or SRBC, and MDE.  We have 12 operating wells and one surface water in-take in our Maryland systems.
 
The Clean Water Act has established the foundation for wastewater discharge control in the United States.  The Clean Water Act established a control program for ensuring that communities have clean water by regulating the release of contaminants into waterways.  Permits that limit the amounts of pollutants discharged are required of all wastewater dischargers under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, or the NPDES, permit program.  In accordance with the NPDES permit program, the implementing states set maximum discharge limits for wastewater effluents and overflows from wastewater collection systems. Discharges that exceed the limits specified under the NPDES permit program can lead to the imposition of penalties.  The Clean Water Act also requires that wastewater treatment plant discharges meet a minimum of secondary treatment.  The secondary treatment process can remove up to 90% of the organic matter in wastewater.
 
Under Delaware state laws and regulations, we are required to hold a permit from DNREC for the construction, operation, maintenance or repair of any on-site wastewater treatment and disposal systems with daily design flow rates of 2,500 gallons or greater.  A classification on the facility is performed in accordance with Regulations Licensing Operators of Wastewater Facilities.  The class of operator required for the facility is determined by the Board of Certification for Licensed Wastewater Operations in accordance with Regulations Licensing Operators of Wastewater Facilities.  We work to ensure that we operate environmentally friendly wastewater systems that meet federal, state, and local laws.

Additional General Information
 
Seasonality
 
Substantially all of our water customers are metered, which allows us to measure and bill for our customers’ water consumption.  Demand for water during the warmer months is generally greater than during cooler months primarily due to additional customer requirements for water in connection with cooling systems, swimming pools, irrigation systems and other outside water use.  Throughout the year, and particularly during typically warmer months, demand for water will vary with temperature and rainfall.  In the event that temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than expected, or there is more rainfall than expected, the demand for water may decrease and our revenues may be adversely affected.
Competition
 
Our business in our franchised service areas is substantially free from direct competition with other public utilities, municipalities and other entities.  However, our ability to provide additional water and wastewater services is subject to competition from other public utilities, municipalities and other entities.  Even though our regulated utilities have been granted an exclusive franchise for each of our existing community water and wastewater systems, our ability to expand service areas can be affected by the DEPSC, the MDPSC or the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, or PAPUC, awarding franchises to other regulated water or wastewater utilities with whom we compete for such franchises.
Employees
 
The Company has no collective bargaining agreements with any of its employees, and its work force is not union organized or union represented.  As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of 241 employees.  We believe that our employee relations are good.  Compensation and benefits are reviewed annually and are considered competitive within both the industry and the areas where we operate.
