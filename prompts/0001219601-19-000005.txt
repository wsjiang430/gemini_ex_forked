The Company’s customers for aerosol cans and ends include manufacturers of personal care, food, household and industrial products, including Friesland Campina, Procter & Gamble, SC Johnson and Unilever, among others. The aerosol can business is highly competitive. The Company competes by offering its customers a broad range of products including multiple sizes, multiple color schemes and shaped packaging.
Promotional and Specialty Packaging
The Company’s promotional and specialty packaging businesses are primarily located in Europe and Asia. The Company produces a wide range of promotional and specialty packaging containers with numerous lid and closure variations. The Company’s customers include Britvic and Nestlé among others.
SALES AND DISTRIBUTION
Global marketers qualify suppliers on the basis of their ability to provide global service, innovative designs and technologies in a cost-effective manner.
With its global reach, the Company markets and sells products to customers through its own sales and marketing staffs. In some instances, contracts with customers are centrally negotiated, but products are ordered through and distributed directly by the Company’s local facilities. The Company’s facilities are generally located in proximity to their respective major customers. The Company works closely with customers in order to develop new business and to extend the duration of its existing contracts.
Many customers provide the Company with quarterly or annual estimates of product requirements along with related quantities pursuant to which periodic commitments are given. Such estimates assist the Company in managing production and controlling use of working capital. The Company schedules its production to meet customer requirements. Because the production time for the Company’s products is short, any backlog of customer orders in relation to overall sales is not significant.

SEASONALITY
The food packaging business is somewhat seasonal with the first quarter tending to be the slowest period as the autumn packing period in the Northern Hemisphere has ended and new crops are not yet planted. The industry generally enters its busiest period in the third quarter when the majority of fruits and vegetables are harvested and immediately canned. Due to this seasonality, inventory levels increase in the first half of the year to meet peak demand in the second and third quarters. Weather represents a substantial uncertainty in the yield of food products and is a major factor in determining the demand for food cans in any given year. Generally, beverage products are consumed in greater amounts during the warmer months of the year and sales have generally been higher in the second and third quarters of the calendar year. 
The Company’s other businesses tend not to be as significantly affected by seasonal variations.
COMPETITION
Most of the Company’s packaging products for consumer goods are sold in highly competitive markets, primarily based on price, quality, service and performance. The Company competes with other packaging manufacturers as well as with fillers, food processors and packers, some of whom manufacture containers for their own use and for sale to others. The Company’s competitors include, but are not limited to, Ardagh Group, Ball Corporation, BWAY Corporation, Can-Pack S.A., Metal Container Corporation and Silgan Holdings Inc.
The Transit Packaging Division also faces substantial competition from many regional and local competitors of various sizes in the manufacture, distribution and sale of its products. The division differentiates itself from the competition by leveraging its global scale, broad product portfolio and established brand reputation. The division's products compete, to some extent, with various other packaging materials, including other products made of paper, plastics, wood and various types of metal.
CUSTOMERS
The Company’s largest customers consist of many of the leading manufacturers and marketers of packaged consumer products in the world. Consolidation trends among beverage and food marketers have led to a concentrated customer base. The Company’s top ten global customers represented in the aggregate approximately 29% of its 2018 net sales. In each of the years in the period 2016 through 2018, no one customer accounted for more than ten percent of the Company’s net sales. Each operating segment, with the exception of the Transit Packaging Segment, has major customers and the loss of one or more of these major customers could have a material adverse effect on an individual segment or the Company as a whole. Major customers include those listed above under the caption "Products". In addition to sales to Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola, the Company also supplies independent licensees of Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola. 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
The Company's principal Research, Development & Engineering ("RD&E") Centers for packaging products for consumer goods are located in Alsip, Illinois and Wantage, United Kingdom. The Company utilizes its centralized RD&E capabilities to advance and deliver technologies for the Company's worldwide packaging activities that (1) promote development of value-added metal packaging systems for its customers, (2) design cost-efficient manufacturing processes, systems and materials and material-efficient container designs that further the sustainability of metal packaging, (3) provide continuous quality and/or production efficiency improvements in its manufacturing facilities, (4) advance customer and supplier relationships, and (5) provide value-added engineering services and technical support. These capabilities facilitate (1) the identification of new and/or expanded market opportunities by working directly with customers to develop new packaging products or enhance existing packaging products through the application of new technologies that better differentiate customers' products in the retail environment (for example, the creation of new packaging shapes, novel decoration methods, or the addition of digital content through unique codes) and/or the incorporation of consumer-valued features (for example, improved openability and/or ease of use) and (2) the reduction of manufacturing costs by reducing the material content of the Company's products (while retaining necessary performance characteristics), reducing spoilage, and increasing operating efficiencies in manufacturing facilities.
The Company maintains a substantial portfolio of patents and other intellectual property ("IP") in the field of metal packaging systems and seeks strategic partnerships to extend its IP in existing and emerging markets. As a result, the Company has licensed IP in geographic regions where the Company has a limited market presence today. Existing technologies such as SuperEnd® beverage ends, 360 End™ beverage ends, Easy-Flow™ beverage ends, Eole™ easy-open food ends and can shaping have been licensed in Australia, Japan, and Africa to provide customers with global access to Crown's brand building innovations.

Crown Holdings, Inc.

The Transit Packaging Division has a distributed RD&E model and is well known throughout its markets for its ability to drive product innovation and leadership in new technologies. The division focuses on market driven innovation and has a long history of creating product and service solutions that solve problems and create value for its customers. The division's individual business units are primarily responsible for designing and executing their own research and development projects and the division's development process is comprised of a customer-oriented, "outside-in" approach. The division works with customers to determine their most pressing industrial packaging challenges, utilizing a rigorous multi-step product development process to ensure that they shape the ultimate product for both the customer and the broader market. Transit Packaging's track record of new product innovation is due in large part to the success of this model.
The Transit Packaging Division has been an industry leader in industrial packaging innovation over the last 100 years as evidenced by their introduction of the first strap packaging product (1913), the first fully-automatic strapping machine (1946), the industry's first battery operated plastic strap hand tools (1995), and most recently the industry's first battery-operated steel strap hand tools (2013). At the core of its intellectual property strategy is a focus on obtaining quality patents that cover key products and technologies, in alignment with its business objectives. The Transit Packaging Division has grown its global patent portfolio to over 380 United States issued patents or pending patent applications and over 1,300 foreign issued patents or pending patent applications. The portfolio broadly covers about 400 customized technologies and spans diverse business platforms, as well as the different countries in which it operates. The division continues to grow its patent base and has filed 170 new patent applications since the beginning of 2010.
The Company spent $51 million in 2018, $39 million in 2017, and $41 million in 2016 in its RD&E activities. Certain of these activities are expected to improve and expand the Company's product lines in the future. These expenditures include projects to improve manufacturing efficiencies, reduce unit costs, and develop new and improved value-added packaging systems. 
MATERIALS AND SUPPLIERS
The Company uses various raw materials, primarily aluminum and steel, in its manufacturing operations. The Transit Packaging division also uses materials derived from crude oil and natural gas, such as polyethylene and polypropylene. In general, these raw materials are purchased in highly competitive, price-sensitive markets, which have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality. These and other materials used in the manufacturing process have historically been available in adequate supply from multiple sources.
The Company has agreements for what it considers adequate supplies of raw materials. However, sufficient quantities may not be available in the future due to, among other things, shortages due to excessive demand, weather or other factors, including disruptions in supply caused by raw material transportation or production delays. From time to time, some of the raw materials have been in short supply but, to date, these shortages have not had a significant impact on the Company’s operations.
In 2018, consumption of steel and aluminum represented 21% and 36% of consolidated cost of products sold, excluding depreciation and amortization. Due to the significance of these raw materials to the overall cost of products sold, raw material efficiency is a critical cost component of the products manufactured. Supplier consolidations, changes in ownership, government regulations, political unrest and increased demand for raw materials in the packaging and other industries, among other risk factors, could cause uncertainty as to the availability of and the level of prices at which the Company might be able to source such raw materials in the future. Moreover, the prices of aluminum and steel can be subject to significant volatility. The Company’s raw material supply contracts vary as to terms and duration, with steel contracts typically one year in duration with fixed prices or set repricing dates, and aluminum contracts typically multi-year in duration with fluctuating prices based on aluminum ingot costs. The Company generally attempts to mitigate its steel and aluminum price risk by matching its purchase obligations with its sales agreements; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to fully mitigate that risk.
The Company also uses commodity and foreign currency forwards in an attempt to manage its exposure to aluminum price volatility.
There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to fully recover from its customers the impact of aluminum and steel price increases or that the use of derivative instruments will effectively manage the Company’s exposure to price volatility. In addition, if the Company were unable to purchase steel and aluminum for a significant period of time, its operations would be disrupted, and if the Company were unable to fully recover the higher cost of steel and aluminum, its financial results may be adversely affected. As a result of continuing global supply and demand pressures, other commodity-related costs affecting the Company’s business may increase as well, including utility and freight-related costs. The Company will attempt to increase prices on its products accordingly in order to recover these costs.
In response to the volatility of raw material prices, ongoing productivity and cost reduction efforts in recent years have focused on improving raw material cost management.

The Company’s manufacturing facilities are dependent, in varying degrees, upon the availability of water and processed energy, such as natural gas and electricity. Certain of these may become difficult or impossible to obtain on acceptable terms due to external factors, which could increase the Company’s costs or interrupt its business.
Aluminum and steel, by their very nature, can be recycled at high effectiveness and can be repeatedly reused to form new consumer packaging with minimal or no degradation in performance, quality or safety. By recycling these metals, large amounts of energy can be saved and significant water use and carbon dioxide emissions avoided.
SUSTAINABILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS
The Company’s operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, disposal of waste, discharges into water, emissions into the atmosphere and the protection of employee health and safety. Future regulations may impose stricter environmental requirements on the packaging industry and may require additional capital investment. Anticipated future restrictions in some jurisdictions on the use of certain coatings may require the Company to employ additional control equipment or process modifications. The Company has a Corporate Sustainability Policy and a Corporate Environmental Protection Policy. Environmental awareness is a key component of sustainability. Environmental considerations are among the criteria by which the Company evaluates projects, products, processes and purchases. The Company is committed to continuous improvement in product design and manufacturing practices to provide the best outcome for the human and natural environment, both now and in the future. By reducing the per-unit amount of raw materials used in manufacturing its products, the Company can significantly reduce the amount of energy, water and other resources and associated emissions necessary to manufacture metal containers. The Company aims to continue that process of improvement in its manufacturing process to assure that consumers and the environment are best served through the use of metal packaging. The Company is also committed to providing a safe work environment for its employees through programs that emphasize safety awareness and the elimination of injuries and incidents. There can be no assurance that current or future environmental laws or liabilities will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Discussion of the Company’s environmental matters is contained within “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Annual Report under the caption “Environmental Matters,” and under Note P to the consolidated financial statements.
WORKING CAPITAL
The Company generally uses cash during the first nine months of the year to finance seasonal working capital needs. The Company’s working capital requirements are funded by cash flows from operations, revolving credit facilities and receivables securitization and factoring programs.
Further information relating to the Company’s liquidity and capital resources is set forth within “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Annual Report under the caption “Liquidity” and under Note M to the consolidated financial statements.
EMPLOYEES
At December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately 33,000 employees. Collective bargaining agreements with varying terms and expiration dates cover approximately 17,000 employees. The Company does not expect that renegotiation of the agreements expiring in 2018 will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flow.
