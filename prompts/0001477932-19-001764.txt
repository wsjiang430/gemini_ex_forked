Item 1 – Business
Corporate Structure
 
We were incorporated as Cetrone Energy Company on January 28, 2008 in the State of Nevada. From inception until we completed our reverse acquisition of FSP, the principal business of the Company originally was to develop “green” renewable fuel sources for agricultural operations, specifically biodiesel. On July 26, 2010, we filed an amendment to our articles of incorporation changing our name to Fresh Start Private Management, Inc. During that time, we had no revenue and our operations were limited to capital formation, organization, and development of our business plan and target customer market. As a result of the reverse acquisition of FSP, on October 31, 2011, we ceased our prior operations and we are now a holding company and our wholly owned subsidiary engages in alcoholism and opioid addiction treatment through our BioCorRx® Recovery Program and related products.
 
On October 31, 2011, we completed a reverse acquisition transaction through a share exchange with FSP whereby we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of FSP in exchange for 37,000,000 shares of our common stock, which represented approximately 31.3% of our total shares outstanding immediately following the closing of the Share Exchange. As a result of the Share Exchange, FSP became our wholly-owned subsidiary.
 
The share exchange transaction with FSP was treated as a reverse acquisition, with FSP as the acquirer and the Company as the acquired party. Unless the context suggests otherwise, when we refer in this Report to business and financial information for periods prior to the consummation of the reverse acquisition, we are referring to the business and financial information of FSP. 
 
On January 7, 2014, we filed an amendment to our articles of incorporation changing our name to BioCorRx Inc.
 
Effective July 5, 2016, the Company amended its articles of incorporation to increase the authorized shares of capital stock of the Company from two hundred million (200,000,000) shares of common stock, and eighty thousand (80,000) shares of preferred stock, both $.001 par value respectively, to five hundred twenty five million (525,000,000) shares common stock ($0.001 par value), and six hundred thousand (600,000) shares of preferred stock (no par value), respectively.
 
On July 28, 2016, we formed BioCorRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Nevada Corporation (“BioCorRx Pharmaceuticals”), for the purpose of developing certain business lines. In connection with its formation, 24.2% of BioCorRx Pharmaceuticals’ outstanding shares of common stock were issued to officers of the Company with the Company retaining 75.8%. 
 
On November 23, 2016, the Company” filed a certificate of designations, rights and preferences with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada pursuant to which the Company set forth the designation, powers, rights, privileges, preferences and restrictions of the Series B Preferred Stock. 
 
On January 16, 2018, majority shareholders holding 59% of the voting equity voted to amend the Company’s articles of incorporation to increase the authorized shares of capital stock of the Company from five hundred twenty five million (525,000,000) shares of common stock, $.001 par value per share, and six hundred thousand (600,000) shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value per share, to seven hundred fifty million (750,000,000) shares of common stock ($0.001 par value per share) and six hundred thousand (600,000) shares of preferred stock ($0.001 par value per share (the “Share Increase”)). The Share Increase took effect on May 10, 2018.

On January 16, 2018, majority shareholders holding 59% of the voting equity voted to grant discretionary authority to the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”), at any time or times for a period of 12 months after the date of the written consent, to adopt an amendment to our articles of incorporation to effect a reverse split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock in a range of not less than 1-for-5 and not more than 1-for-500. On January 16, 2019, the Board approved an amendment to the articles of incorporation to effect a 1-for-100 reverse stock split (the “Reverse Stock Split”). The Reverse Stock Split was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada and subsequently approved by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) on January 18, 2019 and took effect on January 22, 2019. All share and per share information in this Annual Report have been retroactively adjusted to give effect to the Reverse Stock Split, including the financial statements and notes thereto.
 
Business Overview
 
We have developed and own the rights to an innovative alcoholism and opioid addiction treatment program, called BioCorRx® Recovery Program that empowers patients to succeed in their overall recovery. We offer a comprehensive medication-assisted treatment (MAT) program that combines non-addictive medication coupled with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) modules and peer recovery support and tracking. We have been operating for over 6 years and over 1,000 patients have been treated with our program since we began operating. The addiction treatment services reported cost from provider to patient is an average of $12,500 per patient and a portion is sometimes covered by insurance according to treatment providers. This amount varies due to many factors, the major ones being, type of insurance policy and patients out of network deductibles. In addition, there are the service provider expenses, and surgery center costs (if not done in the medical provider’s office). Services may also be provided to cash patients, by licensed providers, at discounted rates due to financial difficulties.
 
The BioCorRx® Recovery Program is a comprehensive addiction program which includes peer support coaching and counseling modules (typically completed in16 sessions on average but not limited to), coupled with a naltrexone implant. The implant is specifically compounded with a prescription from a medical doctor for each individual and is designed to release naltrexone into the body over multiple months. The naltrexone implant means a single administration, long acting naltrexone pellet(s) that consists of a naltrexone formulation in a biodegradable form that is suitable for subcutaneous implantation in a particular patient.
 
In August 2017, the Company announced that it had decided to seek U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) approval on BICX102 in advance of BICX101. Product candidate BICX102 is a long-acting naltrexone implant that can last several months being developed for opioid dependence and alcohol use disorders. The pre-IND meeting date for BICX102 took place on January 24, 2018. On February 12, 2018, the Company announced that the FDA deemed the 505(b)(2) pathway as an acceptable route for approval for BICX102; the Company plans to apply for dual indications, both opioid use disorder and alcohol use disorder, within the same application. A grant application was submitted to the National Institutes of Health on May 14, 2018 for funding the development and study plans for BICX102.
 
On January 17, 2019, the Company received a Notice of Award from the United States Department of Health and Human Services for a grant from the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) in support of BICX102 from the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The grant provides for (i) $2,842,430 in funding during the first year and (ii) $2,831,838 during the second year subject to the terms and conditions specified in the grant, including satisfactory progress of project and the availability of funds.
 
Treatment Philosophy
 
Our alcoholism and opioid addiction treatment program empowers patients to succeed. A detailed description of our treatment philosophy is as follows:
 
Medical Intervention: It is essential to significantly reduce a patient’s cravings for alcohol and opioids in order to fully break the cycle of addiction. We have built our BioCorRx® Recovery Program around a state-of-the-art, minimally invasive, biodegradable implant of naltrexone. The naltrexone medication is an FDA-approved pharmaceutical used for the treatment of alcoholism and opioid addiction. A licensed physician surgically inserts a marble-sized pellet(s) under the skin in the lower abdomen. The pellet is absorbed into the body and typically dissolves within months following the procedure in most patients depending on their metabolism and other factors.
Focus on Treatment: Unlike many other addiction treatment programs, we focus primarily on the treatment of alcohol and opioid addiction. 
 
Comprehensive Approach: Alcoholism and opioid addiction are complex diseases that needs a program specifically designed to treat the body, the mind, and the spirit of one suffering from addiction. We have created a comprehensive recovery program that includes state-of-the-art medical intervention, individually tailored peer support and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) counseling modules used by trained addiction specialists. Our program typically lasts for 6 months from the initial surgical procedure of inserting the naltrexone pellet(s) to the last peer support coaching session. We believe that through our comprehensive treatment method, clients will have the highest possible chances of full recovery from alcohol and opioid dependency.

Program Description
 
We offer a comprehensive and highly effective alcohol and opioid addiction treatment program. Our proprietary program is designed to offer treatment and healing to both the body and the mind of those suffering from addiction. Our alcoholism and opioid addiction treatment program is a two-part program that includes: (i) the insertion of a naltrexone implant that is believed to reduce physical cravings of alcohol and opioids by a trained physician; and (ii) peer support and CBT that focuses on the psycho-social aspect of addiction. The following is a detailed description of our treatment program.
Naltrexone Implant: Our unique program has reduced physical cravings for numerous patients suffering from alcoholism and opioid addiction. Our implant is believed to reduce cravings over the period of multiple months in most patients depending on their metabolism and other factors. During this time, the program focuses on addressing the mental dependence on alcohol and/or opioids. The implant is a naltrexone pellet(s) that is the size of a marble and inserted via an outpatient surgical procedure into the lower abdomen of the patient. The naltrexone pellets will be absorbed by the body over time and will automatically dissolve and not need to be removed unless otherwise required.
 
All procedures to place the naltrexone pellets into patients are performed at several independently owned and licensed provider locations. There are approximately 18 licensed providers throughout the United States that offer the BioCorRxÒ Recovery Program. Locations of the provider locations offering our program can provided by calling our toll free number (888) 993-1099. The procedures are performed by a licensed medical professional. We do not intend for this website address to be an active link or to otherwise incorporate by reference the contents of the website into this Annual Report. 
 
The naltrexone implant is produced by select compounding pharmacies contracted by BioCorRx Inc. We entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Trinity Purchase Agreement”) dated August 20, 2018 with Trinity Compound Solutions, Inc. (“Trinity”). In accordance with the Trinity Purchase Agreement, the Company purchased the worldwide contractual rights, except for New Zealand and Australia, for the naltrexone implant formulation from Trinity. The purchase price for the naltrexone implant was $20,000 cash and 20,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock of Company. Half of the $20,000 will be paid upon the completion of a training program and half was paid upon the transfer of the naltrexone implant. The shares were issued in December 2018. The naltrexone implant is part of the MAT program (see above). This cannot be sold in New Zealand and Australia due to the limitations imposed by the Trinity Purchase Agreement. 
 
The naltrexone implant is one or two small pellets that are inserted beneath the skin in the subcutaneous fat located in the lower abdomen. The implant procedure is an outpatient procedure that takes approximately 20-30 minutes. A local anesthetic is administered before the pellets are implanted and the patient is free to leave the clinic and return to normal activities within a few hours of the procedure in most cases. The pellets are biodegradable and will gradually dissolve in the human body. The pellets contain a medicine called naltrexone, which has been shown to block receptors in the brain that crave alcohol and opioids. Naltrexone is an FDA approved medication and all patients are required to obtain a prescription for the medication from a medical doctor. The doctors employed by the licensed providers are responsible for evaluating the patients, determining if the patient is a candidate and, if so, writing the prescription. The prescription is then presented to compounding pharmacies contracted by Trinity that produce the pellets using naltrexone as the core ingredient. BioCorRx does not compound, manufacture or handle the naltrexone implants.
 
Once the pellet is implanted in the patient, they are usually free to return to work on the next business day and will be contacted by a peer support specialist and/or counselor within a few days if not prior to the procedure to begin the behavioral portion of the program.

BioCorRxÒ Recovery Program CBT: We developed a CBT program to assist patients in addressing their dependence on alcohol and/or opioids. Prior to, or upon receiving the naltrexone implant, each patient will typically speak with a counselor/therapist. This counselor/therapist will treat the patient for the next several weeks following the implant using the program modules in combination with their own skill sets to help them cope with and address their dependence on alcohol and/or opioids. It usually takes approximately 16 sessions to complete the program modules.
 
As part of the peer support and CBT program, peer support specialists/counselors focus on bringing family and friends into the recovery process. This provides emotional support for patients and allows them to understand that they have people that care for them and want them to remain sober. The peer support portion of the program typically lasts for 6 months.
 
Marketing Strategy
 
We have and will continue to use a variety of advertising and marketing channels to increase awareness and exposure to the BioCorRx® Recovery Program amongst prospective patients. In addition to word of mouth from patients, we are focusing on building strategic relationships with private insurance and government payers.
Competition
 
We believe we are one of the leading companies offering a MAT program that is focused on substance abuse treatment in the United States specific to naltrexone therapy. Many treatment providers operate in a broader behavioral healthcare sector without focusing primarily on substance abuse with MAT. We believe our core focus on MAT and scalable program gives us with an advantage over competitors in terms of building our brand and marketing our program to potential customers.
 
We believe the primary competitive factors affecting our business include:
 

· | Quality of clinical programs and services; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Reputation and brand recognition; 
· | Senior management experience including key opinion leaders in addiction; and
· | Sustained release naltrexone products used to treat substance abuse. 

Growth Strategy
 
There has been a significant focus on increasing access to MAT for opioid addiction. The development of new effective treatments has risen and is of great importance given the devasting effects of opioid use disorder. In February 2018, the FDA announced its plan to expand MAT for opioid dependence by providing new guidance to the industry. We believe MAT is becoming more recognized as the gold standard of care for the treatment of substance use disorder. The intended purpose of MAT for opioid use disorder includes a decrease in illicit opioid use, decreased mortality, and improved long-term sobriety. 
 
We have developed a program that we believe helps patients battle their mental and physical addiction to alcohol and opioids more effectively than traditional methods. We are currently operating in Anaheim, California and market nationally. We are constantly seeking and contracting with additional independent treatment providers in the United States and ramping up efforts to establish pilot programs with local and state government entities.

Our strategic growth also includes product research and development pipelines with significant market opportunities being developed under our subsidiary BioCorRx Pharmaceuticals. Development of BICX102 is an essential element to grow the business and gain payer acceptance; the product candidate is a long-acting naltrexone implant that can last several months being developed for opioid dependence and alcohol use disorders.
 
Government Regulation and Approvals
 
All surgical procedures need to be performed by a licensed physician or medical professional.
 
The naltrexone implant does not require regulatory approval because naltrexone is already an FDA approved medication. Once the physician writes a prescription for naltrexone implant, a pharmacist can put it into a compounded form under U.S. compounding laws and then distribute the compounded medication directly to the ordering physician treating the intended patient. The pharmacy is required to be properly licensed in each state to which the implant is being distributed.
Intellectual Property/Licensing Rights
 
On August 20, 2018, we entered into the Trinity Purchase Agreement with Trinity. In accordance with the Trinity Purchase Agreement, the Company purchased the worldwide contractual rights, except for New Zealand and Australia, for the naltrexone implant formulation from Trinity. The purchase price for the naltrexone implant was $20,000 cash and 20,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock. Half of the $20,000 will be paid upon the completion of a training program and half was paid upon the transfer of the naltrexone implant. The shares were issued in December 2018. The naltrexone implant is part of the MAT program (see above). This specific formulation cannot be sold in New Zealand and Australia due to the limitations imposed by the Trinity Purchase Agreement.
 
The BioCorRx CBT program/modules used in the BioCorRxÒ Recovery Program are protected by copyright.
 
On January 26, 2016, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire intellectual and contractual rights for all of North America with the option for Central and South America for naltrexone implant formulas created by the Seller for 24 months upon receipt of the intellectual property for a fee of $55,648. The Company, within the first 12 months has the right to purchase perpetual rights for above territories for a one-time fee, financed over 5 years.
 
On July 28, 2016, the Company and Therakine, Ltd., an Irish private company limited by shares (“Therakine”), entered into a Development, Commercialization and License Agreement (the “Therakine Agreement”). Therakine has know-how and patents related to sustained release drug delivery technology (the “Technology”). Pursuant to the Therakine Agreement, Therakine granted the Company an exclusive license to utilize the Technology in developing injectable naltrexone products to treat patients suffering addiction to opioids, methamphetamines, cocaine, or alcohol. The Company is permitted to sell on a worldwide basis the products that utilize the Technology. The Therakine Agreement expires when the Company’s last valid claim to Therakine’s patents expires. Upon expiration of the Agreement, the licenses granted will become irrevocable and fully paid up.

The Company agreed to pay, in return for the license to the Technology, up to $2,750,000 in milestone payments and royalties ranging from 5% to 12% of net sales of products that use the Technology with aggregate payments per year of not less than $250,000. The Company is also required to pay a percentage of any sublicense income it receives related to products that use the Technology. In the event Therakine enters into a license agreement with a third party for products unrelated to injectable naltrexone that use the Technology, Therakine will pay the Company a percentage of its income from these products. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has paid an aggregate of $250,000 of which includes $75,000 that was previously held in escrow until certain drug levels are met.
 
In 2016, the Company assigned and Therakine agreed to assign the rights under the Therakine Agreement, to BioCorRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the Company’s majority owned subsidiary.
 
On August 20, 2018, we entered into the Trinity Purchase Agreement with Trinity. In accordance with the Trinity Purchase Agreement, the Company purchased the worldwide contractual rights, except for New Zealand and Australia, for the naltrexone implant formulation from Trinity. Further details regarding this agreement can be found above under the heading “Intellectual Property/Licensing Rights.”
 
On October 12, 2018, BioCorRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the Company’s majority owned subsidiary, acquired $15,200 of Therakine Biodelivery GmBH patent families consisting of approximately 11 patents pending and 1 issued patent. The patent families are subject to a Development, Commercialization and License agreement between the Company and Therakine, Ltd. These patents were first licensed to the Company in July 2018 and subsequently were purchased in October 2018.
 
The Company management performed an evaluation of its acquired intangible assets for purposes of determining the implied fair value of such assets at December 31, 2018. The tests indicated that the recorded remaining book value of its acquired license exceeded its fair value for the year ended December 31, 2018 and accordingly recorded on impairment loss of $250,000 and reduced the carrying value to $0.
