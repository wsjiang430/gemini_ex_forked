ITEM 1. BUSINESS

In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Form 10-K”), references to the “Company”, “UPTD” and to “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to TradeUP Acquisition Corp.

Overview

We are a blank check company formed as a Delaware corporation for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this report as our initial business combination.

On July 19, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 4,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one share of common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the “Common Stock”), and one-half of one redeemable warrant (the “Warrant”), each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $40,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, we completed the private sale (the “Private Placement”) of 295,000 shares of Common Stock (the “Private Shares”) to the Company’s founders, TradeUP Acquisition Sponsor LLC (the “Sponsor”) and Tradeup INC., among which, the Sponsor purchased 236,000 Private Shares and Tradeup INC. purchased 59,000 Private Shares at a purchase price of $10.00 per Private Share, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $2,950,000 (the “Private Placement Proceeds”). The Private Shares are identical to the shares of Common Stock sold as part of the Units in the IPO, except that the Private Shares are not transferable, assignable or salable (except to our officers and directors and other persons or entities affiliated with or related to our founders, each of whom will be subject to the same transfer restrictions) until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination. The proceeds of $ $40,800,000 ($10.20 per Unit) in the aggregate from the IPO and the Private Placement (the “IPO Proceeds”), were placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”) established for the benefit of the Company’s public stockholders and the underwriters of the IPO with Wilmington Trust, National Association acting as trustee.
In connection with the IPO, the underwriters were granted an option to purchase up to 600,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any (the “Over-allotment Option”). On July 19, 2021, the underwriters partially exercised the Over-allotment Option, and July 21, 2021, the underwriters purchased 430,000 Units (the “Option Units”) generating gross proceeds of $4,300,000, and net proceeds to the Company of approximately $4,214,000 in the aggregate after deducting the underwriter discount (the “Option Unit Proceeds”). Simultaneously with the issuance and sale of the Option Units, the Company completed the Private Placement sale of 17,200 additional Private Shares at a purchase price of $10.00 per share, among which, the Sponsor purchased 13,760 additional Private Shares and Tradeup INC. purchased 3,440 additional Private Shares, generating total proceeds of $172,000 (the “Private Placement Proceeds” and, together with the Option Unit Proceeds, the “Over-allotment Proceeds”). A total of $4,386,000 of the Over-allotment Proceeds were placed in the Trust Account. The IPO Proceeds and the Over-allotment Proceeds include $1,550,500 payable to the underwriters (the “Business Combination Fee”) pursuant to a certain business combination marketing agreement among us, US Tiger Securities, Inc. (“US Tiger”), EF Hutton, division of Benchmark Investments, LLC (“EF Hutton”) and R.F. Lafferty & Co., Inc., the representatives (the “Representatives”) of the underwriters of the IPO (the “Business Combination Marketing Agreement”).

Our management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the proceeds of the IPO and the Private Placement that are held out of the Trust Account, although substantially all the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally towards consummating a business combination and working capital.

Proposed Business Combination with Estrella

On September 30, 2022, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as it may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”) among Tradeup Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and direct, wholly owned subsidiary of UPTD (“Merger Sub”), and Estrella Biopharma, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Estrella”).

Estrella is a preclinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing CD19 and CD22-targeted ARTEMIS®️ T-cell therapies with the capacity to address treatment and safety challenges for patients with blood cancers and solid tumors. Estrella’s mission is to harness the evolutionary power of the human immune system to transform the lives of patients fighting cancer. For more information regarding the business of Estrella and the proposed Business Combination (as defined below), see the Registration Statement on Form S-4 (File No.: 333-267918) initially filed with the SEC on October 18, 2022, as amended from time to time (the “Form S-4”).

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, among other things, in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended (the “DGCL”), Merger Sub will merge with and into the Estrella (the “Merger”), with Estrella surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of UPTD (“Surviving Company”). The Merger will become effective at such time on the date of the closing of the Merger (the “Closing”) as the certificate of merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State or at such other time specified in the certificates of merger (the “Effective Time”). Effective as of the Closing, UPTD will change its name to “Estrella Immunopharma, Inc.” (“New Estrella”). The transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement is herein referred to as the “Business Combination.”

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, stockholders of Estrella immediately prior to the Effective Time collectively will receive from us, in the aggregate, a number of newly issued shares of Common Stock equal to: (i) $325,000,000 (the “Merger Consideration”), divided by (ii) $10.00 per share in consideration of converting their shares of common stock of Estrella, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Estrella Common Stock”). Each share of preferred stock of Estrella that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically convert into a number of shares of Estrella Common Stock in accordance with the certificate of incorporation of Estrella immediately prior to the Effective Time.

The Merger also calls for additional agreements, including, among others, the Lock-Up Agreement and the Support Agreement, as described elsewhere in the Form S-4.
December 2022 Extension, Related Redemption and Extension Notes

On December 22, 2022, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders (the “2022 Special Meeting”) where the Company was approved by its stockholders to adopt the amended and restated certificate of incorporation to extend the date before which the Company must complete a business combination (the “Combination Deadline”) from January 19, 2023, by one month up to six times, to July 19, 2023 or such earlier date as determined by the board of directors of the Company (such monthly extension is herein referred to as the “Extension”). Upon the stockholders’ approval, on December 29, 2022, the Company filed a certificate of amendment to the amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the “Current Charter”) which became effective upon filing. Additionally, as a result of the 2022 Special Meeting, upon the stockholders’ approval, on December 29, 2022, UPTD and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as the trustee of the Trust Account, entered into the amendment to the Investment Management Trust Agreement dated July 14, 2021.

As a result of the 2022 Special Meeting, 3,519,780 shares of Common Stock were rendered for redemption and approximately $36.1 million was released from the Trust Account to pay such redeeming stockholders.

Under the Current Charter, the Company may extend the Combination Deadline until July 19, 2023 by depositing $45,511 (or $0.05 per share) into the Trust Account (the “Monthly Extension Payment”) for each monthly Extension. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Estrella made two Monthly Extension Payments to the Trust Account, as a result of which, the current Combination Deadline is March 19, 2023. The two Monthly Extension Payments were evidenced by two promissory notes (collectively, the “Extension Notes”) issued by the Company to Estrella, each in the principal amount of $45,511.

Outstanding Promissory Notes and Loans

As of the date hereof, we have outstanding loans from various parties in the aggregated amount of $598,600, which include (i) an unsecured promissory note dated July 25, 2022 (the “Running Lion Note”) in the amount of $204,000 to Running Lion Holdings Limited (“Running Lion”), a company limited by shares incorporated under the laws of British Virgin Islands, which is wholly owned and controlled by Mr. Weiguang Yang, the Co-Executive Officer and director of the Company, (ii) an unsecured promissory note dated July 25, 2022 (the “July 2022 Sponsor Note”) in the amount of $294,600 to Tradeup INC., (iii) an unsecured promissory note dated January 19, 2023 (the “January 2023 Sponsor Note”) in the amount of $50,000 to the Sponsor, to evidence a deposit that the Sponsor provided to the Company to pay its certain operating expenses, and (iv) an unsecured promissory note dated March 3, 2023 in the amount of $50,000 to Tradeup INC. (the “March 2023 Sponsor Note”, together with Running Lion Note July 2022 Sponsor Note, and January 2023 Sponsor Note, collectively the “Notes”).

In connection with the Extension, we issued the Extension Notes in the amount of $91,022 to Estrella to evidence the funds deposited into the Trust Account.

Potential Conflicts

Our executive officers and directors may have interests in the Business Combination or other alternative business combination that are different from, in addition to or in conflict with our stockholders. These interests include, among other things:

· | the fact that the Sponsor, Tradeup INC. and UPTD’s officers and directors (collectively, the “UPTD Initial Stockholders”) have agreed, as part of UPTD’s IPO and without any separate consideration provided by UPTD for such agreement, not to redeem any shares of Common Stock in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the beneficial ownership by the Sponsor of an aggregate of 862,000 founder shares and 249,760 Private Shares, which would become worthless if UPTD does not complete a business combination within the applicable time period, as the Sponsor has waived any right to redemption with respect to these shares;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the beneficial ownership by Tradeup INC. of an aggregate of 104,750 founder shares and 31,220 Private Shares, which would become worthless if UPTD does not complete a business combination within the applicable time period, as Tradeup INC. has waived any right to redemption with respect to these shares. Tradeup INC. paid an aggregate of approximately $2,365, or $0.02 per share, for the Founders Shares and $312,200, or $10.00 per share, for the Private Shares;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Tradeup INC. is an affiliate of US Tiger, an underwriter of the IPO. US Tiger is a New York based investment bank. Both Tradeup INC. and US Tiger are owned by UP Fintech, a Nasdaq listed company (Nasdaq: TIGR). UP Fintech is an online brokerage firm focusing on global Chinese investors. UPTD has entered into the Business Combination Marketing Agreement to engage the Representatives, pursuant to which UPTD engages the Representatives as advisors in connection with UPTD’s potential business combination. UPTD will pay the Representatives the Business Combination Fee for such services upon the consummation of an initial business combination in an amount of $1,550,000, equal to 3.5% of the gross proceeds of the Initial Public Offering (exclusive of any fees which might become payable to third parties for supporting services related to a business combination), among certain percentage of the total Business Combination Fee, is payable to US Tiger. Such payment of the Business Combination Fee is contingent on completion of a business combination;

· | Mr. Jianwei Li, UPTD’S Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is the managing member of the Sponsor, and as such may be deemed to have sole voting and investment discretion with respect to the shares of our Common Stock held by the Sponsor, including 862,000 founder shares and 249,760 Private Shares as described above. In addition, Mr. Jianwei Li directly holds 110,750 founder shares and 31,220 Private Shares, which would become worthless if UPTD does not complete a business combination within the applicable time period, as Mr. Li has waived any right to redemption with respect to these shares. For the shares directly held by Mr. Li, Mr. Li paid an aggregate of approximately $2,500, or $0.02 per share, for the founders shares and $312,200, or $10.00 per share, for the Private Shares;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | each of the three independent directors of UPTD holds 10,000 founder shares, which would become worthless if UPTD does not complete a business combination within the applicable time period, as the independent directors have waived any right to redemption with respect to these shares. Each independent director of UPTD paid approximately $217.50, or $0.02 per share for such 10,000 founder shares. Further, each of the independent directors is entitled to purchase 10,000 founder shares from the Sponsor and Tradeup INC. upon the completion of the Business Combination at the original purchase price of approximately $0.02 per share, or $217.50 in total (80% from the Sponsor and 20% from Tradeup INC);

· | in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, the founders, an affiliate of the founders, or certain of UPTD’s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan UPTD funds as may be required. If UPTD completes the Business Combination, UPTD would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to UPTD. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that the Business Combination does not close, UPTD may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from the Trust Account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,200,000 of such loans may be convertible into the working capital shares that may be issued upon conversion of such working capital loans (“Working Capital Shares”), at a price of $10.00 per share at the option of the lender. As of the date hereof, UPTD had $598,600 outstanding under the working capital loans as evidenced by the Notes accordingly; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the founders and UPTD’s officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred related to identifying, investigating, and consummating an initial business combination, provided, that, if UPTD does not consummate its initial business combination, a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account may be used by UPTD to repay such reimbursements so long as no proceeds from the Trust Account are used for such repayment. As of the date hereof, the UPTD Initial Stockholders and their respective affiliates had not incurred any reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the nomination of Ms. Pei Xu by UPTD as a director of New Estrella following the Closing; Ms. Xu is also the CFO of Zhongchao Inc. (Nasdaq: ZCMD) of which Mr. Weiguang Yang is the CEO;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the continued indemnification of current directors and officers of UPTD and the continuation of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance after the Business Combination;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the fact that the UPTD Initial Stockholders may be incentivized to complete the Business Combination, or an alternative initial business combination with a less favorable company or on terms less favorable to stockholders, rather than to liquidate, in which case the UPTD Initial Stockholders would lose their entire investment. As a result, the UPTD Initial Stockholders may have a conflict of interest in determining whether Estrella is an appropriate business with which to effectuate a business combination and/or in evaluating the terms of the business combination;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the fact that the UPTD Initial Stockholders collectively acquired 1,107,500 founder shares at a purchase price of approximately $0.023 per share and 312,200 Private Shares at a purchase price of $10.00 per share, representing 60.9% of issued and outstanding shares of our Common Stock prior to the Business Combination. However, the newly issued 32,500,000 shares of our Common Stock for the Merger Consideration is based on a deemed price per share of $10.00 per share. Therefore, the UPTD Initial Stockholders could make a substantial profit after the Business Combination from their acquisition of founder shares and/or Private Shares as discussed above, even if the Business Combination subsequently declines in value or is unprofitable for the public stockholder, or the public stockholder experience substantial losses in their investment in New Estrella; and

· | in addition to these interests of the UPTD Initial Stockholders, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable laws, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the “Current Charter”) waives certain applications of the doctrine of corporate opportunity in some circumstances where the application of any such doctrine would conflict with any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations they may have as of the date of the Current Charter or in the future, and UPTD will renounce any expectancy that any of the directors or officers of UPTD will offer any such corporate opportunity of which he or she may become aware to UPTD. UPTD does not believe that the pre-existing fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of its officers and directors materially impacted its search for an acquisition target. Further, UPTD does not believe that the waiver of the application of the corporate opportunity doctrine in the Current Charter had any impact on its search for a potential business combination target.

Subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Delaware law, none of the members of our management team who are also employed by, or directors of, the Sponsor or its affiliates have any obligation to present us with any opportunity for a potential business combination of which they become aware. Our Sponsor and directors and officers are also not prohibited from sponsoring, investing or otherwise becoming involved with, any other blank check companies, including in connection with their initial business combinations, prior to us completing our initial business combination. Our management team, in their capacities as directors, officers or employees of the Sponsor or its affiliates or in their other endeavors, may choose to present potential business combinations to the related entities described above, current or future entities affiliated with or managed by the Sponsor, or third parties, before they present such opportunities to us, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Delaware law and any other applicable fiduciary duties. Our Current Charter provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the company and it is an opportunity that we are able to complete on a reasonable basis.

As more fully discussed in “Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance — Conflicts of Interest,” if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an initial business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he may be required to present such initial business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such initial business combination opportunity to us. Our officers and directors currently have certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations to such other entities (as well as to us). We do not believe, however, that any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our executive officers would materially undermine our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our officers and directors have agreed to present to us all target business opportunities that have a fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the Business Combination Fee payable to our underwriters and taxes payable and interest previously released for working capital purposes on the income earned on the Trust Account ) while we are listed on NASDAQ (and all target business opportunities if we are delisted from NASDAQ) prior to presenting them to any other entity until the earlier of a business combination or our liquidation, subject to any pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations they may have. Our officers and directors have also agreed not to participate in the formation of, or become an officer or director of, any other special purpose acquisition company with a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act until we have entered into a definitive agreement regarding our initial business combination or we have failed to complete our initial business combination within the required time period.

Status as a Public Company

We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the target business for shares of our stock or for a combination of shares of our stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, road show and public reporting efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.

Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation consequences. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders’ interests. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.

We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.

We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.

Financial Position

With funds in the Trust Account available for a business combination initially in the amount of $38,600,000, after payment of approximately $36.1 million to the redeeming stockholders in connection with the Extension and $1,550,500 for the Business Combination Fee, before fees and expenses associated with our initial business combination, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt or leverage ratio. Because we are able to complete our business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third-party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us.
Effecting our Initial Business Combination

Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of Our Initial Business Combination

Nasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the Business Combination Fee and taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. The Board determined that this test was met in connection with the proposed Business Combination.
Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination

We are providing our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares in connection with our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the Trust Account is anticipated to be approximately $10.20 per share, without taking into account interest earned on the Trust Account.

The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the Business Combination Fee. However, the amount of the Business Combination Fee is fixed regardless of the level of redemptions from our Trust Account in connection with the Business Combination. As a result, as redemptions increase, the per-share impact of the Business Combination Fee will increase for each non-redeeming stockholder.

The UPTD Initial Stockholders have entered into a letter agreement by and among UPTD and the UPTD Initial Stockholders, dated July 14, 2021, in connection with the IPO (the “IPO Letter Agreement”), pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and any Private Shares held by them in connection with the completion of our business combination. However, if any UPTD Initial Stockholders acquired public shares in or after the IPO, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination by July 19, 2023.

We will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the company entitled to vote at such meeting. The UPTD Initial Stockholders will count towards this quorum and have agreed to vote their founder shares, Private Shares, and any public shares purchased during or after the IPO in favor of our initial business combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding shares of our Common Stock voted, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our initial business combination once a quorum is obtained. UPTD’s Initial Stockholders collectively own 1,419,700 shares of our Common Stock (including 1,107,500 founder shares and 312,200 Private Shares). As a result, in addition to the UPTD Initial Stockholders’ founder shares and Private Shares, we do not need additional shares to vote in favor of the business combination for it to be approved (assuming either all outstanding shares are voted or only the quorum is present and voted.

These quorums and voting thresholds, and the IPO Letter Agreement may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its public shares irrespective of whether they vote, do not vote, or abstain, and if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against, or abstain from voting on the proposed transaction, and irrespective of whether they were a public stockholders on the record date for the special meeting in connection for the vote to approve the business combination.

Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of Initial Business Combination

If we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, the Current Charter provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in the IPO, which we refer to as the “Excess Shares.” We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 20% of the public shares sold in the IPO could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem no more than 20% of the public shares sold in the IPO, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, the Current Charter does not restrict our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against, or to abstain from voting on, our business combination.

In addition, the Current Charter provides that we will only redeem the public shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of the Business Combination Fee (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of our Common Stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the Business Combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete a business combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of our Common Stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.

Tendering Stock Certificates in Connection with Redemption Rights

Public stockholder seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” are required to tender their certificates to our transfer agent up to two business days prior to the Special Meeting, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using the Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for public stockholder to use electronic delivery of their public shares.

There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the public shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $120.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.

The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders’ vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an “option window” after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company’s stock in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.

Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the stockholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of the public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our business combination.

If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then the public stockholder who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.

If the Business Combination with Estrella is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target by July 19, 2023 (or such later date as may be approved by UPTD stockholders in an amendment to its Current Charter).

Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if No Initial Business Combination

The Current Charter provides that we have until July 19, 2023 to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our business combination by July 19, 2023, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to $50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholder’s rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and the Board, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our business combination by July 19, 2023.

The UPTD Initial Stockholders have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any founder shares and Private Shares held by them if we fail to complete our initial business combination within by July 19, 2023. However, if our founders, officers, or directors acquire public shares in or after the IPO, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination by July 19, 2023.

The UPTD Initial Stockholders have agreed, pursuant the IPO Letter Agreement, that they will not propose any amendment to the Current Charter (i) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by July 19, 2023, or (ii) with respect to any other material provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless we provide the public stockholder with the opportunity to redeem their shares of our Common Stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we will only redeem the public shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of the Business Combination Fee (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement (described above) we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of the public shares.

We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the approximately $500,000 of proceeds held outside the Trust Account, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the Trust Account not required to pay taxes on interest income earned on the Trust Account balance, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $50,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses.

If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of the IPO and the sale of the Private Shares, other than the proceeds deposited in the Trust Account, and without taking into account interest earned on the Trust Account, the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.20. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of the public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than $10.20. Under Section 281(b) of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.

Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses, or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest, and claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account for the benefit of the public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the Trust Account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility, or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the Trust Account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver.

In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts, or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for any reason. The Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (i) $10.20 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, then the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims We have not independently verified whether the Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that the Sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. We have not asked the Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations. Therefore, we cannot assure you that the Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the Trust Account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.20 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of the public shares. None of our officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.

In the event that the proceeds in the Trust Account are reduced below (i) $10.20 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and the Sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against the Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against the Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so if, for example, the cost of such legal action is deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or if the independent directors determine that a favorable outcome is not likely. We have not asked the Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations and we cannot assure you that the Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.20 per public share.

Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our Trust Account distributed to the public stockholder upon the redemption of the public shares in the event we do not complete our business combination by July 19, 2023 may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.

Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of the Trust Account distributed to the public stockholder upon the redemption of the public shares in the event we do not complete our business combination within by July 19, 2023, is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution. If we are unable to complete our business combination by July 19, 2023, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes or for working capital purposes (less up to $50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholder’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and the Board, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem the public shares as soon as reasonably possible by July 19, 2023 and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.

Because we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account. As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the Trust Account is remote. Further, the Sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the Trust Account are not reduced below (i) $10.20 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest withdrawn to pay taxes and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims.

If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust Account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.20 per share to the public stockholder. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, the Board may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholder from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.

The public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the Trust Account only (i) in the event of the redemption of the public shares if we do not complete our business combination by March 19, 2023, subject to applicable law, (ii) in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to the Current Charter (a) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of the public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination by July 19, 2023 or (b) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, or (iii) our completion of an initial business combination, and then only in connection with those public shares that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described in the S-1. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the Trust Account. A stockholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a stockholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights as described above.

Lack of Business Diversification

For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. In addition, we intend to focus our search for an initial business combination in a single industry. By completing our business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team

Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’ management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team or of our board, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our business combination, it is presently unknown if any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business. The determination as to whether any members of our board of directors will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.

Following a business combination, to the extent that we deem it necessary, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management team of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.

Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve our Initial Business Combination

We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of initial business combinations we may consider and whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law for each such transaction.

--


Type of Transaction | WhetherStockholder Approval isRequired
--------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------
Purchase of assets | No 
Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company | No 
Merger of target into a subsidiary of the company | No 
Merger of the company with a target | Yes 


Under Nasdaq’s listing rules, stockholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example:


● | we issue shares of Common Stock that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of shares of our Common Stock then outstanding;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | any of our directors, officers or substantial stockholders (as defined by Nasdaq rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of Common Stock could result in an increase in outstanding common shares or voting power of 5% or more; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the issuance or potential issuance of Common Stock will result in our undergoing a change of control. 


The decision as to whether we will seek stockholders approval of a proposed business combination in those instances in which stockholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on business and legal reasons, which include a variety of factors, including, but not limited to: (i) the timing of the transaction, including in the event we determine stockholder approval would require additional time and there is either not enough time to seek stockholder approval or doing so would place the company at a disadvantage in the transaction or result in other additional burdens on the company; (ii) the expected cost of holding a stockholder vote; (iii) the risk that the stockholders would fail to approve the proposed business combination; (iv) other time and budget constraints of the company; and (v) additional legal complexities of a proposed business combination that would be time-consuming and burdensome to present to stockholders.

Potential Purchases of our Securities

In connection with the stockholder vote to approve the proposed Business Combination, the founders, directors, officers or advisors or their respective affiliates may privately negotiate transactions to purchase our Common Stock from stockholders who would have otherwise elected to have their shares redeemed in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules for a per-share pro rata portion of the Trust Account. None of UPTD’s founders, directors, officers or advisors or their respective affiliates will make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or during a restricted period under Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Such a purchase would include a contractual acknowledgement that such stockholder, although still the record holder of UPTD Common Stock, is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights, and could include a contractual provision that directs such stockholder to vote such shares in a manner directed by the purchaser. In the event that the founders, directors, officers or advisors of UPTD or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholder who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. Any such privately negotiated purchases may be effected at purchase prices that are below or in excess of the per-share pro rata portion of the Trust Account. The purpose of any such purchases of our Common Stock could be to vote such shares in favor of the Business Combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the Business Combination or to satisfy the closing conditions pursuant to the Merger Agreement that requires UPTD to have, among the others, (i) net tangible assets no less than $5,000,0001, (ii) an aggregate of at least $20,000,000 Available Combined Cash Amount (as defined in the Merger Agreement); and (iii) at least $20,000,000 Merger Financing (as defined in the Merger Agreement), upon the completion of the Business Combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. Any such purchases of our Common Stock or our Warrants may result in the completion of Business Combination that may not otherwise have been possible. UPTD expects any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements.

In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our Common Stock or our Warrants and the number of beneficial holders of UPTD’s securities may be reduced, possibly making it difficult to obtain or maintain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.

However, in the event the founders, directors, officers, or advisors of UPTD or their affiliates were to purchase shares or warrants from public stockholder, such purchases would by structured in compliance with the requirements of Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act including, in pertinent part, through adherence to the following:

      the founders, directors, officers, or advisors of UPTD or their affiliates will purchase public shares or our Warrants from public stockholder outside the redemption process at a price no higher than the price offered through the redemption process;

      the registration statement/proxy statement filed in connection with the Business Combination would include a representation that any of the public shares or our Warrants purchased by the founders, directors, officers, or advisors of UPTD or their affiliates from public stockholder outside the redemption process would not be voted in favor of approving the Business Combination;



12
--



      the founders, directors, officers, or advisors of UPTD or their affiliates do not possess any redemption rights with respect to the public shares or our Warrants or, if they possess such redemption rights, they have entered into a letter agreement pursuant to which they have waived such rights; and

      UPTD will disclose in the Form 8-K to be filed prior to the holding of its stockholder meeting to approve the Business Combination the following material items:

a.       the number of the public shares or Warrants purchased by the founders, directors, officers, or advisors of UPTD or their affiliates from public stockholder outside the redemption process, along with the purchase price for such public shares or our Warrants;
b.      the purpose of the purchases of such public shares or Warrants by the founders, directors, officers or advisors of UPTD or their affiliates;

c.       the impact, if any, of the purchases of such public shares or Warrants by the founders, directors, officers, or advisors of UPTD or their affiliates on the likelihood that the Business Combination will be approved and consummated;

d.       the identity of the selling stockholders who sold such public shares or Warrants to the founders, directors, officers, or advisors of UPTD or their affiliates (if not purchased on the open market) or the nature of the selling stockholders (e.g., 5% security holders) who sold such public shares or our Warrants to the founders, directors, officers or advisors of UPTD or their affiliates; and

e.       the number of public shares or our Warrants for which UPTD has received redemption requests pursuant to its redemption offer.

Competition

In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding Warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Facilities

Our executive offices are located at 437 Madison Avenue, 27th Floor, New York, New York 10022.

Employees

We currently have three executive officers including Messrs. Jianwei Li and Weiguang Yang, the Co-Chief Executive Officers and Ms. Luqi Wen, the Chief Financial Officer. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the initial business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information

We have registered our Units, Common Stock and Warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.

We have filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our business combination.

We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with GAAP. We cannot assure you that any particular target business selected by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.

We are required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.

Legal Proceedings

There is no material litigation, arbitration or governmental proceeding currently pending against us or any members of our management team in their capacity as such.
