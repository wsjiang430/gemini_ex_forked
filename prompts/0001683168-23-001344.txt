ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are an all-electric, off-road powersports vehicle company developing and building electric motorcycles and four-wheel utility terrain vehicles (UTVs), also known as side-by-sides, along with a complete line of upgrades and accessories. In October 2020, we began building and testing prototypes for our future offerings with two off-road motorcycles – the Grunt and the Runt. Our motorcycles feature unique frame designs protected by design patents. Additional utility and design patents have been filed for other aspects of Volcon’s vehicles.
 
We initially began to sell and distribute the Grunt and related accessories in the U.S. on a direct-to-consumer sales platform. We terminated our direct-to-consumer sales platform in November 2021. Prior to the termination of our direct-to-consumer sales platform, U.S. customers made deposits for 360 Grunts (net of cancellations) and five Runts, plus accessories and a delivery fee representing total deposits of $2.2 million. These orders were cancelable by the customer until the vehicle was delivered and after a 14-day acceptance period, therefore the deposits were recorded as deferred revenue. As of June 30, 2022, we had completed shipping of all Grunts sold through our direct-to-consumer sales platform. Due to delays in developing the Runt, we refunded the deposits made for all Runts.
 
Beginning in November 2021, we began negotiating dealership agreements with powersports dealers to display and sell our vehicles and accessories. Customers can now, or will soon be able to, buy our vehicles and accessories directly from a local dealership. Some of these dealers will also provide warranty and repair services to customers. Through December 31, 2022, we have entered into 151 dealership agreements. We also expect to be able to offer the dealers a financing option, or “floor plan” to make larger purchases of our vehicles but we do not currently have this financing option available. We have agreements with third-party financing companies to provide financing to qualified customers of each dealer. There is no recourse to the Company or the dealer if the dealer’s customer defaults on the financing agreement with this third-party.
 
As of December 31 , 2022, we have signed agreements with five importers in Latin America and one importer for the Caribbean Region, collectively referred to herein as the LATAM importers to sell our vehicles and accessories in their assigned countries/markets. In June 2022 we signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Torrot Electric Europa S.A., referred to herein as Torrot, to distribute their electric motorcycles for youth riders in Latin America. We will use our LATAM importers to sell Torrot’s products in Latin America.
 
In October 2022, we signed an expanded agreement with Torrot to also be the exclusive distributor of Torrot and Volcon co-branded youth electric motorcycles in the United States as well as Latin America. This agreement supersedes the original Torrot agreement and once all Torrot branded inventory is sold, we will no longer distribute Torrot branded motorcycles. Finally, in December 2022 we signed an expanded agreement with Torrot to be the exclusive distributor of Volcon co-branded youth electric motorcycles in Canada.
 
We expect to expand our global sales of our vehicles and accessories beyond our current LATAM importer base. We expect to sign more LATAM importers in 2023 and expect to begin selling in Canada, Europe and Australia in 2023. We expect export sales to be executed with individual importers in each country that buy a container of vehicles. Each importer will sell vehicles and accessories to local dealers or directly to customers. Local dealers will provide warranty and repair services for vehicles purchased in their country.

In July 2022, we expanded our offerings with the introduction of the first of our Volcon UTV models, the Stag, which we anticipate will be available for delivery to customers possibly in the first half of 2023, followed by additional models of the Stag expected in 2024 and 2025, and the introduction of a higher performance, longer range UTV (to be named) which timing for release is yet to be determined. The Stag will be manufactured by a third-party and incorporate electrification units, which include batteries, drive units and control modules provided by General Motors. Beginning in June 2022 we have taken non-binding pre-production orders which are cancelable prior to delivery.
 
Through August 2022 we assembled the Grunt in a leased production facility in Round Rock, Texas. In August 2022, we announced that we will outsource the manufacturing of the Grunt to a third-party manufacturer, which we anticipate will reduce costs and improve profitability on the Grunt. We began receiving Grunts from this manufacturer in January 2023. We also outsourced the manufacturing of the 2023 Grunt EVO to the same third-party manufacturer. The 2023 Grunt EVO will replace the Grunt and has a belt drive rather than a chain drive as well as an updated rear suspension and new, more ergonomic seat. We received prototypes of the Grunt EVO from the manufacturer in the first quarter of 2023 and expect to begin selling the Grunt EVO in the second quarter of 2023.
 
In September 2022, we reduced our headcount in our product development and administration departments as we outsourced the design and development of certain components of our vehicle development. We also hired our Chief Marketing Officer and expect to hire additional sales and marketing employees and increase marketing activities to further support our brand and products.
 
We began taking pre-orders for a Class 2 eBike, the Brat, in September 2022 and shipments to customers began in the fourth quarter of 2022. In February 2023, we began selling the Brat directly to consumers through our website. The Brat is being manufactured by a third-party.
 
In November 2022, we finalized an agreement for a third-party to manufacture the Runt. We received prototypes of the Runt in the first quarter of 2023 and expect to begin sales in the second quarter of 2023.
 
The estimated fulfillment of all orders we have received to date assumes that our third-party manufacturers can successfully meet our order quantities and deadlines. If they are unable to satisfy orders on a timely basis, our customers may cancel their orders.
 
Our Industry
 
The powersports industry is made up of on-road and off-road motorcycles, scooters, ATVs (all-terrain vehicles), UTVs, PWC (personal watercraft) and snowmobiles.  The ATV market, in which a single rider sits on top of a four-wheeled vehicle (as opposed to sitting inside a UTV), is not a market we currently intend to pursue but will continue to evaluate our lineup of vehicles in the future. We have also developed an electric bicycle, or eBike, the Brat, primarily designed for on-road use but can also be ridden off-road.
 
While we are focusing solely on off-road for our motorcycles and UTVs, we are evaluating requirements in countries such as Canada, where our vehicles will need to be homologated for on-road and off-road use in order to sell them there. We are also considering homologation kits that customers could purchase to allow them to use our vehicles both on-road and off-road depending on federal, state and local government rules and regulations.
 
Outdoor recreation is a major driver of the American economy. In 2021, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, or the BEA, found that outdoor recreation drives $454 billion of the current-dollar gross domestic product for the U.S. The BEA noted that motorcycles and ATVs make up $8.1 billion of that total, which does not include UTVs.

According to Stratview Research – Powersports Market Research Report, the powersports industry grew by 10% in terms of units in 2020, its highest growth rate ever achieved. The long-term outlook for growth and demand for powersports, according to the report, especially off-road vehicles, or ORVs, and power watercraft, or PWCs is positive. The Stratview Research report estimates the powersports market to grow at a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 5.7% during 2022 to 2027 to reach a value of
 $47.9 billion by 2027.
 
According to a report by Allied Market Research, the global ATV and UTV market was valued at $7.6 billion in 2017, and is projected to reach $11.95 billion by 2027, registering a CAGR of 6.7% from 2020 to 2027.
 
According to Market Reports World, global off-road motorcycles market size is estimated to grow at CAGR of almost 8% with new vehicle sales of 124,950 units during the forecast period 2022 to 2027.
 
According to the PowerSports Business 2022 Market Data Book:
 

· | In the U.S., UTV sales were slightly less than 600,000 units in 2021, according to leading industry research firm Power Products Marketing. New motorcycle sales in 2021, meanwhile, were at 557,000 units, revealing that more new UTVs were sold at retail in 2021 than new motorcycles.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Inventory turns remain strong at powersports dealerships. According to dealership feedback, turnover of new unit inventory in 2021 at dealerships was 7.5 turns on average. Similarly, new unit gross margin percentage at the dealership level was 17.4% on average during 2021. 
· | Accessory sales for UTVs continue to skyrocket, with consumers on average purchasing $918 worth of accessories at the time of the new UTV purchase in 2021, Lightspeed data shows. 
· | According to S&P Global Mobility, 2021 new and used UTV registrations reached 334,000, compared to 351,000 in 2020, showing continued post-pandemic strength in the segment. 

 
While the post-COVID pandemic growth rates may not be this steep, and inflationary pressures and any possible recession may impact demand, we believe the new culture of escape and outdoor activities will continue to drive off-road powersports recreation. We believe there are very few all-electric off-road powersports companies, and traditional powersports companies have only recently started making electric products, so significant data on off-road electric vehicles does not exist yet.
 
Our Products
 
We feature motorcycle and UTV products that are all-electric and primarily designed for off-road use. The off-road market is growing faster than on-road and on-road products require costly levels of certification, homologation and compliance with the Department of Transportation (DOT), the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and other government regulators. For our motorcycles and UTVs, we are solely focusing on developing them for the off-road market. Due to these regulations, our motorcycles and UTVs are not legal for on-road use without homologation by customers who may be able to purchase parts or kits from other third-parties. All vehicles other than the Brat will come with a warning label stating “This vehicle is designed and manufactured for off-road use only. It does not conform to federal motor vehicle safety standards and operation on public streets, roads, or highways is illegal”, and therefore our vehicles cannot be legally registered for on-road use in any state in the U.S and in many countries without the customer homologating the vehicle. In addition to powersports vehicles, we source, market and sell accessories and upgrades and continue to source new accessories and upgrades. These do or will feature parts designed to increase performance or appearance, in addition to practical add-ons to equip Volcon vehicles for hunters, anglers, ranchers and farmers.
 
The Brat eBike is a Class 2 eBike designed for on-road and light off-road use.

The Grunt
 
Our first product to market, the Grunt, began shipping to customers in the third quarter of 2021. The Grunt is an electric off-road motorcycle with unique design features and capabilities.
 
The Grunt’s frame, low seat height and oversize tires are designed to make it look like the fat tire bikes of the 1970s and ‘80s. These unique elements of the Grunt are not just for styling, but we believe they help make it easier to ride as compared to other off-road motorcycles on the market. The low seat height and large tires are designed to make the Grunt stable at all speeds on all surfaces in the off-road environment. The electric drivetrain has no clutch and no gears, making it easy for almost any customer to operate.
 
Although the Grunt can be used as delivered, we have developed an app, which can be downloaded at no additional cost, that we believe will enhance the riding experience. The Grunt has a small, optional, dash with limited data; however, the rider can use their smartphones and the app (subject to the rider’s cellular connectivity) as a dashboard by mounting it on the handlebars. The app makes it easier for users to set ride modes, check battery status, and update the bike’s firmware.  In the future we plan to add a trip navigation feature to the app.
 
The Grunt is designed for family off-road adventures, work on the farm or fun transport around private land. Its range can be up to 35 miles (with an optional second battery that provides an additional 35 miles) in its “explore” mode setting and it can be completely charged in less than three hours from a standard wall outlet.
 
We are designing an upgraded Grunt, the 2023 Grunt EVO to replace the Grunt. The Grunt EVO will have a belt drive rather than a chain drive, an upgraded rear shock and rear suspension, and a new seat design and will be available in three different colors and have aftermarket accessories. We expect the Grunt EVO to be available beginning in the first half of 2023.
 
The Runt
 
In the second quarter of 2023, the 2023 Volcon Runt LT is also expected to be available to the market. The Runt LT, which is a smaller version of the groundbreaking Grunt, is better suited for small statured riders, more compact properties and trails, or as a pit bike at race events, while still delivering robust off-road capabilities. Unlike the Grunt, the Runt LT will only have a display to show the rider certain aspects of the vehicle such as speed, battery charge and mode. The app will not be available in the initial version of the Runt LT, but could be developed for future models.
 
Like the Grunt, the Runt LT’s large tires and low-slung chassis will make it easier to ride than traditional off-road motorcycles. The Runt LT will have a range of up to 35 miles in its “explore” mode setting and charges in less than three hours from a standard wall outlet.
 
The Brat
 
We began taking pre-orders for the 2023 Volcon Brat eBike in September 2022 and shipments began in the fourth quarter of 2022. Similar to the lineup of Volcon motorcycles, the Brat has a low seat height, large tires, hydraulic front and rear disc brakes. The Brat is a Class 2 eBike capable of achieving 20 mph maximum speed from throttle assistance. The Volcon app will also work with the Brat provided the rider has downloaded the app to their smartphone and has cellular connectivity.
Volcon Kids
 
In October 2022, we signed an expanded agreement with Torrot to sell Volcon and Torrot co-branded youth electric motorcycles in the United States as well as Latin America and in December 2022 we signed an agreement to also include Canada. The initial line up of these motorcycles are designed for youth riders from ages 4 to 11. The Kids One is designed for youth riders from ages 4 to 6 and the Kids Two is designed for riders ages 7 to 11. We began selling these motorcycles in January 2023. In the second quarter of 2023, we expect to launch a model designed for youth riders from ages 12 to 14.

The Stag
 
In July 2022, we publicly introduced a prototype of the Stag. We began taking pre-production orders from dealers in June 2022 and consumers in July 2022. The consumer pre-production orders will be transferred to dealers located near the consumer, with delivery to customers expected in the first half of 2023. Pre-orders of the Stag are non-binding and cancelable prior to delivery. The Stag will be Volcon’s first utility/sport UTV with a 64” width to ensure it is able to operate in states with 65”-maximum-width trails.
 
The 2023 Stag is our first UTV model launched and will seat up to four people, with folding rear seats, a four point harness system, high performance shocks and tires, on demand all-wheel drive, variable power steering, and a full line of accessories.
 
We expect to introduce a lower performance version of the Stag with smaller tires and shocks but will still include features like on demand all-wheel drive, folding rear seats, a 3 point harness system and a full line of accessories. It will feature hauling and towing abilities for work on a farm or job site, but also fold-up seating for four so it can be used for weekend family adventures.
 
We expect to launch a high performance model of the Stag designed for off-road racing. This model will include a larger battery system, higher motor output, high performance shocks and tires, full time all-wheel drive, locking front and rear differentials, variable power steering and a full line of accessories.
 
We also expect to release other models such as one focused on features for hunters. This version would be designed for mountain terrain, forest roads and back acreage. Like the lower performance version of the Stag, we believe this version will have smaller tires and shocks but will have higher payload and towing capacity than the Stag. We also expect to launch a utility version of the Stag that will have a configurable tilt flatbed system that will be designed for work on the ranch or jobsite.

The timing of the release of other models of the Stag noted above has not yet been determined.
 
We also expect to introduce a larger, longer range UTV (to be named) in 2025, which will be the largest, most powerful model in the Volcon line. We are designing this vehicle to have superior range and speed, but still be able to haul and tow far more than a traditional UTV.
 
Our ability to release new future products is dependent on the success of our current models and our ability to receive future financing of which there is no assurance.
 
Assembly and Manufacturing
 
As of December 31, 2022, we have outsourced the manufacturing of all of our vehicles to third-parties. The Brat is manufactured by a supplier in China and the Grunt, Runt and Stag are or will be manufactured by a supplier in Mexico with some assembly completed in the U.S. The Grunt EVO will be manufactured by a supplier in the US. The Volcon Youth motorcycles are manufactured by Torrot in Spain.
 
We provide a one-year warranty on the Grunt, Volcon Youth motorcycles and the Brat, and a two-year warranty on the battery pack subject to a specified number of charging cycles. We expect the warranty for our other motorcycles will be consistent with the warranty on the Grunt and Brat. We are currently developing the warranty for the Stag but expect that it will be consistent with the warranty of competitors’ UTVs currently in the market.
 
We accrue warranty reserves at the time a vehicle is delivered to the customer. Warranty reserves include our best estimate of the projected cost to repair or to replace any items under warranty, based on actual warranty experience as it becomes available and other known factors that may impact our evaluation of historical data. We review our reserves quarterly to ensure that our accruals are adequate in meeting expected future warranty obligations, and we will adjust our estimates as needed. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of revenues in the statement of operations. The warranty obligation is classified as a current liability on our balance sheet.

Sales and Marketing
 
Beginning in November 2021, we began negotiating dealership agreements with powersports dealers to display and sell our vehicles and accessories. Customers can now, or will soon be able to, buy our vehicles and accessories directly from a local dealership. Through December 31, 2022, we have entered into 151 dealership agreements covering 34 states. We are currently negotiating additional dealership agreements with retail partners to display and sell our vehicles and accessories. Some of these dealers will also provide warranty and repair services to our customers.
 
We anticipate our vehicles and accessories will be sold globally in a three-phase rollout of export sales– Latin American importers started in 2022, and Canada expected in 2023, subject to meeting each countries homologation requirements, if any. Export sales are expected to be executed through individual importers in each country that purchase vehicles from us by the container. Each importer is expected to sell vehicles to local dealers or directly to customers. Local dealers are intended to provide warranty and repair services for vehicles purchased within their markets.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we currently rely on a combination of trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements, and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology.
 
Our industrial designs are protected by design patents. In addition, we intend to file for additional utility patents. There is no assurance that we will be granted any such patents. We do not know whether any patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. Even if granted, there can be no assurance that our issued patents or new patent applications will provide us with protection.
 
We have a registration for the trademark GRUNT in the United States. We have also applied to register additional marks – including VOLCON, VOLCON BRAT, VOLCON STAG, GRUNT EVO, EMPOWERING ADVENTURE, RUNT, and STAG - in the United States, Canada, and certain additional countries in Latin America, and many of these marks are now allowed or registered in some of these countries. While we previously received notice from two entities who opposed our applications for the VOLCON mark in the United States, Mexico, and elsewhere due to the alleged similarity of the mark VOLCON to their trademarks, we have resisted these efforts because we believe that the marks are not similar and there is no potential for confusion. We are in the process of resolving these matters. We have obtained a coexistence agreement providing that our VOLCON trademark can coexist with one party’s trademark. The other party’s opposition was unsuccessful. Our efforts to secure trademark registrations for VOLCON and other trademarks referenced above are ongoing and we may encounter resistance from other companies, though we have received no such notice from any other companies at this time. If we receive objections from other entities and are unsuccessful in obtaining agreements or otherwise resolving the matters with these entities, we will need to consider the use of different trademarks for our Company and our products.
 
Competition
 
There are dozens of manufacturers that sell off-road motorcycles, UTVs and eBikes in the United States and even more globally. The markets for powersport vehicles and eBikes are highly competitive based on a number of factors, including innovation, performance, price, technology, product features, styling, fit and finish, brand recognition, quality and distribution. We believe our ability to compete successfully in these markets depends on our ability to capitalize on our competitive strengths and build brand recognition.
 
Many companies, which have greater financial and marketing resources than Volcon, make electric street motorcycles, including Zero Motorcycles. Some companies make electric UTVs as part of their product line. For example, Polaris has recently announced a joint venture with Zero Motorcycles to help them design dedicated electric UTVs, the first product of which was released in December 2021; however, at the time of this filing, remains to be delivered to market. Many companies, like Super 73, make and sell eBikes and have a stronger established brand name and product line.

Government regulations
 
We have focused on the off-road-only portion of the market because it is free of many of the homologation issues and highway certifications required to produce and sell an on-road vehicle. In some states, off-road vehicles do have legislative restrictions, but they are related to noise and exhaust emissions, two things our vehicles do not produce. 
 
Federal, state, and local governments have promulgated and/or are considering promulgating laws and regulations relating to the safety of our products. In the United States, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has federal oversight over product safety issues related to off-road vehicles and eBikes. We believe that our products comply with all applicable CPSC safety standards as well as all other applicable safety standards in the United States.
 
The assembly, use, storage, transport and disposal of battery packs is subject to extensive regulation. Complying with these requirements involves substantial costs, and any failure to do so may result in heavy fines or other restrictions on our operations. Additionally, we may be responsible for the recycling and proper disposal of expended batteries from our vehicles. We may enter into agreements with third-parties to manage such recycling and disposal; however, we may be found liable for any failures in compliance by these third-parties and subject to fines or remediation liabilities, which costs may be substantial.
 
We intend to sell and distribute our vehicles internationally through international distributors. As such, we will be subject to the local laws of each jurisdiction in which we sell our vehicles. These regulations may result in increased costs and expenses, which may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
 
Human Capital
 
Volcon Mission
People are at the core of our DNA. Our mission is to build industry leading products that connect people to outdoor experiences through the intentional blending of leading technology and design. Our vision is to amplify the powersports experience for all. Our values are building the future of powersports. Our employees recognized that everyone is someone’s customer, which is why our goal is for each employee at Volcon is to treat others as you would want to be treated.
Professional Employer Organization
Since inception through December 31, 2022, we used professional employer organizations ("PEOs") to outsource our employee base, including processing of payroll and administration of benefits. Beginning January 1, 2023, we have discontinued the use of a PEO and have hired a third-party payroll processing service provider and a third-party administrator of benefits. As of December 31, 2022, in the U.S we have 52 full-time employees and one part-time employee and one full-time individual in Canada on a PEO arrangement. Currently, our employees have not chosen representation by a labor union. We also occasionally engage the services of independent contractors for special projects.
 
Our employees and contractors focus on customer care, developing our products, and building our marketing channels. We believe we offer competitive benefits and training programs to develop employees’ expertise, performance, and engagement, while implementing corporate policies to provide a safe, harassment-free work environment. This work environment is guided by principles of fair and equal treatment and prioritizes effective communication and employee engagement.
 
Employee Engagement
As a developing organization, we are committed to building a strong culture with high levels of employee engagement. We have completed surveys to evaluate employee satisfaction. This assessment provides employees with the ability to grade commitment to our mission and values. We believe that our employees are our greatest asset and are striving to consistently evaluate our progress in developing and maintaining engagement.
