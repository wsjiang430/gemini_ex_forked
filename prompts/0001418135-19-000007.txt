ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OUR COMPANY
Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. is a leading beverage company in North America with a diverse portfolio of flavored (non-cola) carbonated soft drinks ("CSDs"), specialty coffee and non-carbonated beverages ("NCBs"), and the #1 single serve coffee brewing system in North America. KDP has some of the most recognized beverage brands in North America, with significant consumer awareness levels and long histories that evoke strong emotional connections with consumers. We have a highly competitive distribution system that enables our portfolio of more than 125 owned, licensed and partner brands to be available nearly everywhere people shop and consume beverages. 
References in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to "we", "our", "us", "KDP", and the "Company" refer to Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise noted. 
HISTORY OF OUR BUSINESS
Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.
Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. ("DPS") was built over time through a series of strategic acquisitions that brought together iconic beverage brands in North America within Cadbury Schweppes plc ("Cadbury"), building on the Schweppes business by adding brands such as Dr Pepper, Snapple, 7UP, Canada Dry, Mott's, A&W and the Peñafiel business in Mexico.
DPS was incorporated in Delaware on October 24, 2007. In 2008, Cadbury contributed its beverage subsidiaries in the United States ("U.S."), Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean to DPS. DPS continued to add to its portfolio with the acquisition of Bai in 2017. 
Keurig Green Mountain, Inc.
Maple Parent Holdings Corp. ("Maple") is a holding company that conducts substantially all of its business through Keurig Green Mountain, Inc. ("Keurig"), a leading producer of innovative single-serve brewing systems and specialty coffee in the United States and Canada. Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, Inc. was incorporated in July 1993 and acquired Keurig, Incorporated in June 2006 to form Keurig. 
In December 2015, JAB Holding Company S.a.r.l ("JAB") formed an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Maple Holdings Acquisition Corp. ("Maple acquisition merger sub"). In February 2016, Maple was formed by JAB. In March 2016, Maple, through Maple acquisition merger sub, acquired Keurig and its subsidiaries ("Keurig Acquisition"). Refer to Note 3 of the Notes to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the Keurig Acquisition.
In contemplation of the Keurig Acquisition, JAB agreed with Mondelēz International, Inc. ("Mondelēz") that Mondelēz would acquire a 24.24% interest in Maple from JAB, which was also consummated in March 2016. 
The Merger of DPS and Keurig
On January 29, 2018, DPS entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") by and among DPS, Maple and a wholly owned subsidiary of DPS, Salt Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), whereby Merger Sub would be merged with and into Maple, with Maple surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of DPS (the “DPS Merger”). The DPS Merger was consummated on July 9, 2018 (the "Merger Date"), at which time DPS changed its name to "Keurig Dr Pepper Inc." and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol "KDP". 
Immediately prior to the consummation of the DPS Merger (the “Effective Time”), each share of common stock of Maple issued and outstanding was converted into the right to receive a number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock of Merger Sub determined pursuant to an exchange ratio set forth in the Merger Agreement (the “Acquisition Shares”). As a result of the DPS Merger, the stockholders of Maple as of immediately prior to the Effective Time owned approximately 87% of KDP common stock on a fully diluted basis following the closing, and the stockholders of DPS as of immediately prior to the Effective Time owned approximately 13% of KDP common stock on a fully diluted basis following the closing of the DPS Merger. Upon consummation of the DPS Merger, KDP declared a special cash dividend equal to $103.75 per share, subject to any withholding of taxes required by law, payable to holders of its common stock as of July 6, 2018. Refer to Note 3 of the Notes to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the DPS Merger.

All information regarding our brand market positions in the U.S. is based on retail market dollars in 2018. U.S. beverage information is from Information Resources, Inc. ("IRi"); U.S. brewing system information is from NPD Total Market Dataset ("NPD").
In the CSD market segment in the U.S. and Canada, we participate primarily in the flavored segment of the CSD category. In addition to our major brands above, we also own regional and smaller niche brands, such as Sun Drop, Big Red and Vernors. In the CSD market, we distribute finished beverages and manufacture beverage concentrates and fountain syrups. Our beverage concentrates, which are highly concentrated proprietary flavors used to make syrup or finished beverages, are used by our own Packaged Beverages segment, as well as sold to third party bottling companies through our Beverage Concentrates segment. According to IRi, we had a 22.1% share of the U.S. CSD market in 2018 (measured by retail sales), an increase of 4 points versus 2017. We also manufacture fountain syrup that we sell to the foodservice industry directly, through bottlers or through other third parties.
In the NCB market segment in the U.S., we participate primarily in the ready-to-drink tea, juice, juice drinks, water, including enhanced and flavored water, and mixer categories. In addition to our major brands above, we also sell regional and smaller niche brands, such as Nantucket Nectars. We manufacture most of our NCBs as ready-to-drink beverages and distribute them through our own distribution network and through third parties or direct to our customers' warehouses. In addition to NCB beverages, we also manufacture Mott's apple sauce as a finished product.
In Mexico and the Caribbean, we participate primarily in the carbonated mineral water, flavored CSDs, bottled water and vegetable juice categories. In Mexico, we manufacture and sell our brands through both our own manufacturing and distribution operations as well as third party bottlers. In the Caribbean, we distribute our products solely through third party distributors and bottlers. We have also begun to distribute certain products in other international jurisdictions through various third party bottlers and distributors.

Our Keurig open platform single serve brewing system is aimed at changing the way consumers prepare and enjoy coffee and other beverages both at home and away from home in places such as offices, restaurants, cafeterias, convenience stores and hotels. We develop and sell a variety of Keurig brewing systems and, in addition to specialty coffee, produce and sell a variety of other specialty beverages in K-Cup pods (including hot and iced teas, hot cocoa and other beverages) for use with Keurig brewing systems. We also offer traditional whole bean and ground coffee in other package types, including bags, fractional packages and cans. We, together with our partners, are able to bring consumers high-quality coffee and other beverage experiences from the brands they love, all through the one-touch simplicity and convenience of Keurig brewing systems. We currently offer more than 600 beverage varieties from over 75 owned, licensed, partner and private label brands, including the top ten best-selling coffee brands in the U.S. based on IRi, as part of the Keurig brewing system.
OUR STRENGTHS AND STRATEGY
The key strengths of our business are:
Strong portfolio of leading, consumer-preferred brands. We own a diverse portfolio of well-known CSD, coffee and NCB brands. Many of our brands enjoy high levels of consumer awareness, preference and loyalty rooted in their rich heritage. This portfolio provides our retailers, bottlers and distributors, and other customers with a wide variety of products to meet consumers' needs and provides us with a platform for growth and profitability. 
Scale distribution and selling system. We have strategically-located distribution capabilities, which enables us to better align our operations with our customers, to ensure our products are available to meet consumer demand, to reduce transportation costs and to have greater control over the timing and coordination of new product launches. We actively manage transportation of our products using our fleet (owned and leased) of approximately 5,800 and 1,600 vehicles in the U.S. and Mexico, respectively, as well as third party logistics providers. 
Innovation, renovation, acquisition and partnering capabilities. We drive growth in our business by a combination of innovating and renovating our portfolio of owned brands and partnerships with other leading beverage brands. We have a robust consumer-centric innovation program, which is designed to meet consumers' changing flavor and beverage preferences and to drive new household penetration of our single serve brewing systems. We have cultivated relationships with leading beverage brands to create long-term partnerships that enable us and our partners to benefit equitably in future value creation, and where appropriate, we bring these partner brands into our owned portfolio through acquisitions. 
Highly efficient business model. Our highly efficient business model, both from a cost and a cash perspective, gives us optionality to invest internally and look outside for acquisitions or other options to continue to drive growth.
OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS
As of December 31, 2018, our operating structure consists of four reporting segments: Beverage Concentrates, Packaged Beverages, Latin America Beverages and Coffee Systems. Segment financial data, including financial information about foreign and domestic operations, is included in Note 21 of the Notes to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements.
Beverage Concentrates
Our Beverage Concentrates segment is principally a brand ownership business where we manufacture and sell beverage concentrates in the U.S. and Canada. Most of the brands in this segment are CSD brands. Key brands include Dr Pepper, Canada Dry, Crush, Schweppes, Sunkist soda, 7UP, A&W, Sun Drop, Squirt, RC Cola and the concentrate form of Hawaiian Punch. Almost all of our beverage concentrates are manufactured at our plant in St. Louis, Missouri.
Beverage concentrates are shipped to third party bottlers, as well as to our own manufacturing systems, who combine them with carbonation, water, sweeteners and other ingredients, package the combined product in PET containers, glass bottles and aluminum cans, and sell them as a finished beverage to retailers. Beverage concentrates are also manufactured into syrup, which is shipped to fountain customers, such as fast food restaurants, who mix the syrup with water and carbonation to create a finished beverage at the point of sale to consumers. Dr Pepper represents most of our fountain channel volume. 
Our Beverage Concentrates brands are sold by our bottlers through all major retail channels including supermarkets, fountains, mass merchandisers, club stores, vending machines, convenience stores, gas stations, small groceries, drug chains and dollar stores. 
In 2018, the PepsiCo affiliated and Coca-Cola affiliated bottler systems represent a small number of customers where the loss of any one or more of those customers could have a material adverse effect on the Beverage Concentrates segment. Unlike the majority of our other CSD brands, approximately 60% of Dr Pepper, Schweppes and Crush finished good volumes are distributed through either the PepsiCo affiliated or Coca-Cola affiliated bottler systems.
3

Packaged Beverages
Our Packaged Beverages segment is principally a brand ownership, manufacturing and distribution business. In this segment, we primarily manufacture and distribute packaged beverages of our brands. Additionally, in order to maximize the size and scale of our manufacturing and distribution operations, we also distribute packaged beverages for our allied brands and manufacture packaged beverages for certain private label beverages in the U.S. and Canada. 
Our larger NCB brands in this segment include Snapple, Hawaiian Punch, Mott's, Clamato, Bai, Yoo-Hoo, Deja Blue, Core, ReaLemon, Mistic, Vita Coco coconut water, and Mr and Mrs T mixers. Our larger CSD brands in this segment include Dr Pepper, 7UP, Canada Dry, A&W, Sunkist soda, Squirt, RC Cola, Big Red, and Vernors. 
Approximately 90% of our 2018 Packaged Beverages net sales come from the manufacturing and distribution of our own brands and the manufacturing of certain private label beverages. The remaining portion of our 2018 Packaged Beverages net sales came from the distribution of our partner brands such as Vita Coco coconut water, AriZona tea, Neuro drinks, High Brew, evian, Peet's Coffee and Forto Coffee shots. Although the majority of our Packaged Beverages net sales relate to our brands, we also provide a route-to-market for these third party brand owners seeking effective distribution for their new and emerging brands. These brands give us exposure in certain markets to fast growing segments of the beverage industry with minimal capital investment.
Our Packaged Beverages products are manufactured in multiple facilities across the U.S. and are sold or distributed to retailers and their warehouses by our own distribution network or by third party distributors. 
We sell our Packaged Beverages products both through our Direct Store Delivery system ("DSD") and our Warehouse Direct delivery system ("WD"), both of which include the sales to all major retail channels, including supermarkets, fountains, mass merchandisers, club stores, vending machines, convenience stores, gas stations, small groceries, drug chains and dollar stores.
In 2018, Walmart represents the largest customer of our Packaged Beverages segment, where its loss could have a material adverse effect on the Packaged Beverages segment.
Latin America Beverages
Our Latin America Beverages segment is a brand ownership, manufacturing and distribution business, with operations in Mexico representing approximately 90% of segment net sales. This segment participates mainly in the carbonated mineral water, flavored CSD, bottled water and vegetable juice categories, with particular strength in carbonated mineral water, vegetable juice categories and grapefruit flavored CSDs. The largest brands include Peñafiel, Squirt, Aguafiel, Clamato and Crush.
In Mexico, we manufacture and distribute our products through our bottling operations and third party bottlers and distributors. We sell our finished beverages through all major Mexican retail channels, including small outlets, supermarkets, hypermarkets, convenience stores and on-premise channels. In the Caribbean, we distribute our products through third party bottlers and distributors. We have also begun to distribute certain products in other international jurisdictions through various third party bottlers and distributors. 
In 2018, Walmart and OXXO represent a small number of customers where the loss of one of those customers would have a material adverse effect on the Latin America Beverages segment.
Coffee Systems
Our Coffee Systems segment is primarily a producer of innovative single-serve brewing systems and specialty coffee in the U.S. and Canada. The multi-brand brewing system is aimed at changing the way consumers prepare and enjoy coffee and other beverages both at home and away from home in places such as offices, restaurants, cafeterias, convenience stores and hotels. We develop and sell a variety of Keurig brewers and, in addition to coffee, produce and sell a variety of other specialty beverages in K-Cup pods (including hot and iced teas, hot cocoa and other beverages) for use with Keurig brewing systems. We also develop and sell brewer accessories, including pod storage racks, baskets, brewer carrying cases and other coffee-related equipment and accessories. We also offer traditional whole bean and ground coffee in other package types, including bags, fractional packages and cans. 
Our Coffee Systems segment offers pods primarily in the single-serve K-Cup pod format. We manufacture and sell 100% of the K-Cup pods of our own brands, such as Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, The Original Donut Shop, Van Houtte, Laughing Man and REVV. We have licensing and manufacturing agreements with our partner brands to manufacture over 80% of the K-Cup pods in the U.S. and Canada, including brands such as Starbucks, Peet's Coffee, Dunkin' Donuts, Caribou Coffee, Eight O’Clock, Folgers, Maxwell House, Newman’s Own Organics and Tim Hortons, and private label arrangements. Our Coffee Systems segment also has agreements for manufacturing, distributing, and selling K-Cup pods for tea under brands such as Celestial Seasonings, Lipton and Tazo in addition to K-Cup pods of our own brand, Snapple. We also produce and sell K-Cup pods for cocoa, including through a licensing agreement for the Swiss Miss brand, and hot apple cider.
4

Our Coffee Systems segment manufactures its K-Cup pods in facilities in North America that include specialty designed proprietary high-speed packaging lines using freshly roasted and ground coffee as well as tea, cocoa and other products. We offer high-quality coffee including single-origin, organic, flavored, limited edition and proprietary blends. We carefully select our coffee beans and appropriately roast the coffees to optimize their taste and flavor differences. We engineer and design all of our single-serve brewing systems, where we then utilize third-party contract manufacturers located in various countries in Asia for brewer appliance manufacturing. We distribute our Coffee Systems products using third-party distributors and retail partners.
In 2018, Walmart and Costco Wholesale Corporation ("Costco") represent a small number of customers where the loss of one of those customers would have a material adverse effect on the Coffee Systems segment.
OUR CUSTOMERS
We primarily serve the following types of customers: 
Retailers
Retailers, including supermarkets, mass merchandisers, club stores, e-commerce retailers, office superstores, and convenience stores, purchase finished beverages, appliances, accessories, and K-Cup pods directly from us. Our portfolio of strong brands, operational scale and experience in the beverage industry has enabled us to maintain strong relationships with major retailers in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. In 2018, our largest retailer was Walmart, representing approximately 14% of our consolidated net sales.
Bottlers and Distributors
In the U.S. and Canada, we generally grant perpetual, exclusive licenses for CSD brands and packages to bottlers for specific geographic areas. These agreements prohibit bottlers and distributors from selling the licensed products outside their exclusive territory and selling any imitative products in that territory. Generally, we may terminate bottling and distribution agreements only for cause, change in control or breach of agreements and the bottler or distributor may terminate without cause upon giving certain specified notice and complying with other applicable conditions. Fountain agreements for bottlers generally are not exclusive for a territory, but do restrict bottlers from carrying imitative product in the territory. 
In 2010, we completed the licensing of certain brands to PepsiCo, Inc. ("PepsiCo") and The Coca-Cola Company ("Coca-Cola"). The agreements have an initial period of 20 years with automatic 20-year renewal periods and require PepsiCo, Coca-Cola and certain Coca-Cola affiliated bottlers to meet certain performance conditions.
Certain brands, such as Snapple, Yoo-Hoo, Mistic and Nantucket Nectars are licensed for distribution in various territories to bottlers and a number of smaller distributors such as beer wholesalers, wine and spirit distributors, independent distributors and retail brokers. 
Partners
We have differentiated ourselves and the Keurig brand through our ability to create and sustain partnerships with other leading coffee, tea and beverage brand companies through multi-year licensing and manufacturing agreements that best suit each brand's interests and strengths. Typically, we manufacture pods on behalf of our partners, who in turn sell them to retailers.
As of December 31, 2018, our partner brands included, but were not limited to, Starbucks, Peet's Coffee, Dunkin' Donuts, Caribou Coffee, Eight O’Clock, Folgers, Maxwell House, Newman’s Own Organics, Tim Hortons, Kirkland Signature, Great Value, Kroger, Celestial Seasonings, Lipton and Tazo.
Away from Home Channel Participants
We distribute brewers, accessories and K-Cup pods (both Keurig and partner brands) to away from home channel participants, which include restaurants, hotel chains, and office coffee distributors. 
End-use Consumers
We developed a robust ecommerce platform at www.keurig.com where end-use consumers can purchase brewers, accessories, and K-Cup pods. 
OUR ALLIED BRANDS
As a result of our distribution capabilities, we believe brand owners view us as a partner with a strong route-to-market resources to grow their brands. These partnerships allow us to rapidly participate in growth in emerging and fast growing categories where we do not currently have a brand presence. We sometimes make an investment in each company. As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio of allied brands we distribute included, but was not limited to, evian, Peet's Ready to Drink coffee, Forto Coffee, Vita Coco coconut waters, High Brew coffee and Neuro drinks. 
5

OUR COMPETITORS
The beverage industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve in response to changing consumer preferences. Competition is generally based on brand recognition, taste, quality, price, availability, selection and convenience. We compete with multinational corporations with significant financial resources. In our bottling and manufacturing businesses, we also compete with a number of smaller bottlers and distributors and a variety of smaller, regional and private label manufacturers. 
The following represents a list of our major competitors:

Competitor | Categories 
PepsiCo | CSDs, NCBs 
Coca-Cola | CSDs, NCBs 
Monster Energy | CSDs (Energy) 
Red Bull | CSDs (Energy) 
The Campbell Soup Company ("Campbell") | NCBs (Juice) 
Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc. | NCBs (Juice) 
Welch's | NCBs (Juice) 
Nestlé S.A. ("Nestle") | NCBs (Water), Packaged Coffee
The Kraft Heinz Company ("Kraft Heinz") | Packaged Coffee 
The J.M. Smucker Company ("Smucker") | Packaged Coffee 

Although these companies offer competing brands in categories we participate in, several of these companies are also our partners and customers, such as Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Kraft Heinz, as they purchase beverage concentrates or K-Cup pods directly from us.
OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We possess a variety of intellectual property rights that are important to our business. We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, patents and trade secrets to safeguard our proprietary rights, including our brands, our technologies, and ingredient and production formulas for our products.
We own numerous trademarks in our portfolio within the U.S., Canada, Mexico and other countries. Depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained. 
In many countries outside the U.S., Canada and Mexico, our rights to many of our CSD brands, including our Dr Pepper trademark and formula, were sold by Cadbury beginning over a decade ago to third parties including, in certain cases, to competitors such as Coca-Cola.
We license various trademarks from third parties, which generally allow us to manufacture and distribute certain products or brands throughout the U.S. and/or Canada and Mexico. For example, we license from third parties the Sunkist soda, Stewart's, Rose's and Margaritaville trademarks. Although these licenses vary in length and other terms, they generally are long-term, cover the entire U.S. and/or Canada and Mexico and generally include a royalty payment to the licensor.
We hold U.S. and international patents related to Keurig brewing systems and K-Cup pod technology. Of these, a majority are utility patents and the remainder are design patents. We view these patents as valuable assets but we do not view any single patent as critical to our success. We also have pending patent applications associated with Keurig brewing systems and K-Cup pod technology. We take steps that we believe appropriate to protect such innovation. 
OUR RAW MATERIALS
The principal raw materials we use in our business, which we commonly refer to as ingredients and packaging, are aluminum cans and ends, PET bottles and caps, K-Cup pod packaging materials, glass bottles and enclosures, green coffee, paper products, juices, teas, fruit, sweeteners, water, and other ingredients. We also use post-consumer recycled materials in the manufacturing of our single-serve brewing systems.These ingredients and packaging costs can fluctuate substantially and comprise approximately 55% of our cost of sales.
When appropriate, we mitigate the exposure to volatility in the prices of certain commodities used in our production process and transportation to our customers through the use of various commodity derivative contracts or supplier pricing agreements. The intent of the contracts and agreements is to provide a certain level of short-term predictability in our operating margins and our overall cost structure, while remaining in what we believe to be a competitive cost position.
6

Ingredients and materials, excluding green coffee. Under many of our supply arrangements for these raw materials, the price we pay fluctuates along with certain changes in underlying commodities costs, such as aluminum in the case of cans and ends, natural gas in the case of glass bottles, resin in the case of PET bottles and caps, corn in the case of sweeteners and pulp in the case of paperboard packaging. 
Green coffee. We use a combination of outside brokers and direct relationships with farms, estates, cooperatives, and cooperative groups for our supply of green coffee. Outside brokers are the largest source of our green coffee supply. In 2018, 31% of our purchases of green coffee were responsibly sourced, and 84% were traceable back to the exporter mill, group or farm. We believe that traceability helps us secure long-term supplies of high-quality coffee. The majority of our green coffee purchases are high-quality, premium grade, which results in higher prices as compared to regular green coffee.
Fuel costs. In addition to ingredients and packaging costs, we are significantly impacted by changes in fuel costs, which can also fluctuate substantially, due to the large truck fleet we operate in our distribution businesses and the energy costs consumed in the production process. The fuels costs associated with our distribution businesses are reflected within our selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses.
SEASONALITY
The beverage market is subject to some seasonal variations. Our cold beverage sales are generally higher during the warmer months, while hot beverage sales are generally higher during the cooler months. Overall beverage sales can also be influenced by the timing of holidays and weather fluctuations.
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 25,500 employees.
In the U.S., we have approximately 20,000 full-time employees. We have collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 4,500 full-time employees. These agreements address working conditions as well as wage rates and benefits. 
In Mexico, we have approximately 4,000 employees, of which approximately 3,000 are covered by collective bargaining agreements. In Canada, we have approximately 1,500 employees, of which approximately 500 are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We do not have a significant number of employees in other countries.
We believe we have good relations with our employees.
ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS
In the normal course of our business, we are subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. We maintain environmental, health and safety policies and a quality, environmental, health and safety program designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The cost of such compliance measures does not have a material financial impact on our operations.
Sustainability
We are committed to making a positive impact in the communities in which we live and work and to leave the world better than we found it. We continue to focus on efforts to improve sustainability throughout our value chain, working to reduce our environmental impact while helping to ensure the Company's financial growth. These efforts include:

• | Designing our packaging to enhance circular material use, including recyclability and recoverability;


• | Driving initiatives with industry, government and community partners to educate consumers on recycling behaviors, develop infrastructure and processing capabilities and increase packaging recycling rates;


• | Expanding responsible sourcing practices with suppliers and growers across our supply chain;


• | Working through partnerships in coffee-growing communities to engage more people in our supply chain, with the goal of significantly improving their lives;


• | Identifying opportunities to reduce energy consumption in our fleet and in our facilities while also building climate resiliency across our value chain;


• | Reducing waste sent from our manufacturing facilities to landfills; and


• | Supporting freshwater protection and restoration projects in watersheds where we have production facilities, while increasing the efficiency of our water use for beverage production.

Post-consumer Recycling
For CSDs and NCBs, the vast majority of our beverage containers are 100% recyclable. For our Coffee Systems products, we completed the conversion to 100% recyclable K-Cup pods in Canada at the end of 2018, targeting to have all our manufactured K-Cup pods recyclable by 2020. Our third-party manufacturers also use post-consumer recycled materials in the manufacturing of our single-serve brewing systems.
We are looking beyond our own operations to address the issue of post-consumer recycling. We continue to work with industry, government and community partners on goals and efforts to increase U.S. beverage container recycling rates. We maintain active involvement, partnerships and investments in efforts to improve consumer recycling, including focused efforts with Keep America Beautiful, The Closed Loop Fund and The Recycling Partnership.
REGULATORY MATTERS
We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business. Regulations apply to many aspects of our business, including our products and their ingredients, manufacturing, safety, labeling, transportation, recycling, advertising and sale. For example, our products and their manufacturing, labeling, marketing and sale in the U.S. are subject to various aspects of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Lanham Act, state consumer protection laws and state warning and labeling laws. Certain cities and municipalities within the U.S. have also passed various taxes on the distribution of sugar-sweetened and diet beverages, which are at different stages of enactment. In Canada and Mexico, the manufacture, distribution, marketing and sale of many of our products are also subject to similar statutes and regulations. Additionally, the government of Mexico enacted broad based tax reform in 2016, including a tax on every liter of certain sugar-sweetened beverages we manufacture.
Various states and other authorities require deposits, eco-taxes or fees on certain containers. Similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at local, state and federal levels, both in the U.S. and elsewhere. In Mexico, the government has encouraged the soft drink industry to comply voluntarily with collection and recycling programs for plastic materials, and we are in compliance with these programs.
