ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
 
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company currently focused on the treatment of ophthalmic disorders, including dry eye syndrome (“DES”). We have in-licensed certain rights to purchase, market, sell and distribute a formula known as LO2A, a drug developed for the treatment of DES, and other ophthalmological illnesses, including Conjunctivochalasis (“CCH”) and Sjögren’s syndrome (“Sjögren’s”).
 
LO2A is currently registered and marketed by its inventor in Germany and Switzerland for the treatment of DES, in Hungary for the treatment of DES, CCH and Sjögren’s and in the Netherlands for the treatment of DES and Sjögren’s.
 
We intend to market LO2A as a treatment for DES and other ophthalmic inflammations, including CCH and / or Sjögren’s, in the United States, Israel and China (collectively, the “Licensed Territories”), and in additional territories, subject to purchasing the rights to market, sell and distribute LO2A in those additional territories. We believe that the potential for the most economic success is in marketing LO2A for treating CCH and Sjögren’s. Currently, we have a distribution agreement for marketing in Israel, where LO2A is approved for the treatment of DES only, and a distribution agreement for distribution in China, where the evaluation and preparation for the registration process commenced in December 2017 by the Chinese Distributor (as defined below). The registration process in certain countries, including the United States, requires us to conduct additional clinical trials, in addition to the Phase II clinical trials that we have completed and Phase IV clinical trials that we are currently conducting.

We plan to engage local or multinational distributors to handle the distribution of LO2A. In particular, we intend to engage, subject to obtaining the requisite rights in LO2A, pharmaceutical companies or distributors around the world with relevant marketing capabilities in the pharmaceutical field, in order for such pharmaceutical companies to sell LO2A, with us prioritizing those territories where we may expedite the registration process of LO2A based on existing knowledge and studies previously conducted on LO2A, without requiring additional studies.
 
In August 2016, we commenced the Multi-Center Trial, which is a Phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial, in parallel groups which is intended for the repeated confirmation of the effectiveness and safety of LO2A for patients suffering from moderate to severe CCH. The trial is a multi-center trial in five different medical centers in Israel with a treatment time of three months for each patient. All 62 patients have completed their treatment. We believe that we currently have sufficient funds to complete the Multi-Center Trial by the end of 2018. In November 2018 we received the top line results for the Multi-Center trial which describe analysis of the primary endpoint, defined as the reduction in Lissamine green conjunctival staining (LGCS) score from baseline to 3 months. The originally planned primary analysis was based upon recruitment of a sample size of 62 patients. Analysis was performed on the 49 fully evaluable patients using a mixed model with repeated measures (MMRM) and utilized all post baseline observations, (1-month and 3-month follow-ups) demonstrating statistical significance between the LO2A group and the placebo group (P=0.0079). The planned primary endpoint analysis compared average reduction in LGCS score from baseline to three months. This analysis also demonstrated a strong trend towards significance (P=0.0713) with average reduction in LGCS score between baseline and 3 months of -3.5 and -1.6 in the LO2A and placebo groups, respectively. We expect the full statistical report to be published as soon as the statistical results and conclusion are available and approved.
 
In March 2018, we commenced a Phase IV Study. The Phase IV Study is a multi-center trial in three different medical centers in Israel and will evaluate the safety and efficacy of LO2A for symptomatic improvement of DES in 60 adult patients with Sjögren’s. Enrolled patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment groups, LO2A or Systane® Ultra UD. Drops will be administered topically to the eye over a three month period. This Phase IV Study is designed to support our clinical approval pathway for LO2A for the treatment of DES in patients with Sjögren’s within certain markets including the U.S., China and Israel.
 
On February 7, 2019, we entered into a joint venture agreement with Cannabics, which became effective on March 1, 2019. Pursuant to the agreement, we agreed to form a new joint venture company for the purpose of researching, developing and administering cannabinoid formulations to treat ophthalmic conditions across a range of disease and illness categories. The joint venture will pursue therapeutic pathways with cannabinoids, supported by a growing body of research that we believe indicates cannabinoid-based therapies have the potential to address significant unmet medical needs in the market. We and Cannabics will initially own 50% of the joint venture. The initial board of directors of the new company will consist of three members: one Company appointee, one Cannabics appointee and one industry expert recommended by us and approved by Cannabics. The initial officers of the Company will be our Chairman Noam Danenberg and Cannabics’ Chief Executive Officer Eyal Barad, who will serve as co-chief executive officers. If the joint venture’s business plan is not approved by the Company and Cannabics by June 30, 2019, the joint venture agreement will then expire. In connection with forming the joint venture we issued Cannabics 900,000 shares of our Common Stock and Cannabics issued us 2,263,944 shares of its common stock.

Historical Background and Corporate Details
 
We were originally incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 10, 1999, under the name Bridge Capital.com, Inc. which was a nominally capitalized corporation that did not commence its operations until it changed its name to Denali Concrete Management, Inc., or Denali, in March 2001. Denali was a concrete placement company specializing in providing concrete improvements in the road construction industry and operated primarily in Anchorage, Alaska, placing curb and gutter, sidewalks and retaining walls for state, municipal and military projects. In December 2005, Denali ceased its principal business operations and focused its efforts on seeking a business opportunity.
 
Denali consummated a reverse merger transaction on November 21, 2011, in connection with which the following events occurred:
 

● | We entered into and completed a stock purchase agreement with Can-Fite BioPharma Ltd. (“Can-Fite”), our former controlling shareholder, whereby Can-Fite purchased 333,333 of shares of our common stock, $0.001 par value (“Common Stock”) in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Eye-Fite Ltd. (“Eye-Fite”). As a result of the consummation of the actions contemplated by such agreement, Eyefite became our wholly-owned subsidiary and Can-Fite became our majority stockholder and a parent; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Eyefite and Can-Fite entered into a license agreement dated November 21, 2011 (the “Can-Fite License Agreement”) pursuant to which Can-Fite granted to Eyefite a sole and exclusive worldwide license for the use of CF101, Can-Fite’s therapeutic drug candidate, solely in the field of ophthalmic indications; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Eyefite and Can-Fite entered into a services agreement dated November 21, 2011 (the “Eyefite Services Agreement”) pursuant to which Can-Fite managed, as an independent contractor, all activities relating to pre-clinical and clinical studies performed for the development of the ophthalmic indications of CF101. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Upon completion of that transaction, and after giving effect to the transactions described above, we had an aggregate of 435,053 issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock. Of these shares Can-Fite owned approximately 82%. Following the transactions, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, Eyefite, became a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing therapeutic products for the treatment of ophthalmic diseases.
 
On November 10, 2016, we entered into a non-binding letter of intent with Wize Israel for a proposed reverse merger. Subsequently, on May 21, 2017, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”), with Bufiduck Ltd., a company formed under the laws of the State of Israel and our wholly owned subsidiary (“Merger Sub”) and Wize Israel, which contemplated the merger of Merger Sub with and into Wize Israel, with Wize Israel continuing as the surviving entity and becoming our wholly owned subsidiary (the “Merger”).
 
On October 10, 2017, at our annual meeting of stockholders (the “2017 Annual Meeting”), our stockholders approved, among other matters, (a) an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Common Stock, from 100,000,000 to 500,000,000, (b) an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to change our name from “OphthaliX, Inc.” to “Wize Pharma, Inc.” immediately prior to the Merger, and (c) the re-election of Pnina Fishman, Ilan Cohn, Guy Regev, Roger Kornberg and Michael Belkin to hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified; provided, however, that, if the Merger was completed, our Board would be reconstituted as described in the proxy statement/prospectus relating to our 2017 Annual Meeting.
 
On October 31, 2017, we, Merger Sub and Wize Israel entered into an amendment to the Merger Agreement which extended the expiration date of the Merger Agreement until November 30, 2017.
 
On November 16, 2017, we were renamed “Wize Pharma, Inc.,” and completed our transaction with Wize Israel in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into Wize Israel, with Wize Israel surviving as our wholly owned subsidiary. Prior to the Merger, we had no active business and were a “shell company” as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). As a result of the Merger, we have ceased to be a “shell company.”
 
In connection with the Merger and under the terms of the Merger Agreement:
 

● | at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”) each ordinary share of Wize Israel that was issued and outstanding was automatically cancelled and converted into 4.1445791236989 shares of our Common Stock (the “Exchange Ratio”) (not adjusted for the Reverse Stock Split). As a result, an aggregate of 3,915,469 shares of our Common Stock were issued to former Wize Israel shareholders. Our pre-Merger stockholders retained an aggregate of 435,053 shares of our Common Stock; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a convertible loan (the “2016 Convertible Loan”) entered into between Wize Israel and Rimon Gold Assets Ltd. (“Rimon Gold”) on March 20, 2016 (as amended on March 30, 2016, December 21, 2017, October 19, 2018 and March 4, 2019, the “2016 Loan Agreement”) in the principal amount of $531,067 was adjusted based on the Exchange Ratio and became convertible into shares of our Common Stock at a conversion price of $0.9768, subject to adjustments for stock splits and similar events set forth in the 2016 Loan Agreement; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a convertible loan (the “2017 Convertible Loan”, and together with the 2016 Convertible Loan, the “Convertible Loans”) entered into between Wize Israel and Ridge Valley Corporation (“Ridge”), and, by way of entering into assignments and assumption agreements following such date, also with Rimon Gold and Shimshon Fisher (“Fisher,” and together with Ridge and Rimon Gold, the “2017 Lenders”), entered into on January 15, 2017 (as amended on December 21, 2017, October 19, 2018 and March 4, 2019, the “2017 Loan Agreement” and, together with the 2016 Loan Agreement, the “Loan Agreements”) in the principal amount of $822,144, was adjusted based on the Exchange Ratio and became convertible into shares of our Common Stock at a conversion price of $1.1112, subject to adjustments for stock splits and similar events set forth in the 2017 Loan Agreement;

● | under the 2016 Loan Agreement, as modified by the 2017 Loan Agreement, the 2017 Lenders have the right until November 30, 2019, to invest up to $796,603, in the aggregate, at $1.308 per share (the “2016 Investment Right”), and under the 2017 Loan Agreement, to invest up to $1,233,216, in the aggregate, at $1.332 per share (the “2017 Investment Right” and, together with the 2016 Investment Right, the “Investment Rights”);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Wize Israel undertook to cause us to issue, to investors in a private placement of Wize Israel that was completed in July and August 2017, warrants to purchase (as adjusted based on the Exchange Ratio) an aggregate of 904,036 shares of our Common Stock at an exercise price of $1.9728 (the “2017 Warrants”), which 2017 Warrants were granted on November 16, 2017; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | immediately prior to the Effective Time, we sold on an “as is” basis to Can-Fite all the ordinary shares of Eyefite, in exchange for the irrevocable cancellation and waiver of all indebtedness owed by us and Eyefite to Can-Fite, including approximately $5 million of deferred payments owed by us and Eyefite to Can-Fite and, as part of the purchase of Eyefite, Can-Fite also assumed certain accrued milestone payments in the amount of $175,000 under the Can-Fite License Agreement. In addition, that certain exclusive license of Can-Fite’s CF101 drug candidate for the treatment of ophthalmic diseases granted to us and the Eyefite Services Agreement was terminated pursuant to a Termination of License Agreement and a Termination of Services Agreement that was entered into on the Closing Date; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | immediately following the Effective Time, Ron Mayron, Yossi Keret, Dr. Franck Amouyal and Joseph Zarzewsky were appointed to our Board to hold office until the earlier of the next annual meeting where directors will be appointed, such director’s successor is elected and qualified, or until such director’s earlier resignation or removal and following those appointments, Pnina Fishman, Ph.D. Ilan Cohen, Ph.D., Guy Regev and Roger Kornberg, Ph.D. resigned from our Board. Accordingly, our Board consisted of five members: Ron Mayron, Yossi Keret, Dr. Franck Amouyal, Joseph Zarzewsky and Dr. Michael Belkin; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | immediately following the Effective Time, Pnina Fishman, Ph.D., Itay Weinstein and Ronen Kantor resigned as our officers and the newly constituted board appointed Or Eisenberg as Acting Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary and Noam Danenberg as Chief Operating Officer; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our Common Stock continued to be quoted on the OTC Pink under the new trading symbol “WIZP” until January 4, 2018, when we commenced trading our Common Stock on the OTCQB; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Wize Israel’s ordinary shares were delisted from the TASE and there was no longer a public trading market for Wize Israel ordinary shares. 

 
Immediately following the completion of the Merger, our pre-Merger stockholders continued to hold 435,053 shares, or 10% of our issued and outstanding Common Stock, and former Wize Israel shareholders owned 3,915,469 shares, or 90% of our issued and outstanding Common Stock (both percentages excluding (i) shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Convertible Loans, (ii) shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Investment Rights, (iii) shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the 2017 Warrants, and (iv) shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of certain options held by our pre-Merger directors and officers (the “Wize Stock Options”). In the event all the Convertible Loans, Investment Rights, 2017 Warrants and Wize Stock Options outstanding as of the Effective Time were to be exercised in full, then our pre-Merger stockholders and option holders would own 439,949 shares and their combined ownership percentage would be reduced to approximately 5.4% of our issued and outstanding Common Stock, and the former Wize Israel shareholders and holders of Convertible Loans, Investment Rights, 2017 Warrants and Wize Stock Options on a combined basis would own 7,750,651 shares, or approximately 94.6% of our issued and outstanding Common Stock, assuming, for the purposes of this calculation, a total of 8,190,600 shares of our Common Stock issued and outstanding on a fully diluted basis.

As a result of the Merger, the business of Wize Israel became our ongoing business.
 
The Merger was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization of us by Wize Israel. Under reverse recapitalization accounting, our assets and liabilities were recorded, as of the completion of the Merger, at their historical amounts. Consequently, the annual consolidated financial information of Wize Israel for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 reflect the operations of the acquirer for accounting purposes together with a deemed issuance of shares, equivalent to the shares held by the former stockholders of the legal acquirer and a recapitalization of the equity of the accounting acquirer. The annual consolidated financial information of Wize Pharma, Inc. for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 include the accounts of Wize Israel since inception and our accounts since the effective date of the reverse recapitalization.
 
On March 5, 2018, we effected the Reverse Stock Split.
 
The following is a historical background and corporate history of Wize Israel prior to the Merger:
 
Wize Israel’s legal and commercial name is Wize Pharma Ltd. It was formed under the laws of the State of Israel as a company limited by shares on June 23, 1982, under the name Eitam Eretz Israel Advanced Industries Ltd. In November 1997, Wize Israel changed its name to Orlil Holdings (1982) Ltd. and in June 2011, Wize Israel changed its name to Star Night Technologies Ltd. In July 2015, Wize Israel changed its name to its current name.
 
In June 1982, Wize Israel completed its initial public offering in Israel and its ordinary shares began trading on the TASE. Prior to the Merger, Wize Israel’s ordinary shares were traded on the TASE under the symbol “WIZP”. From inception until February 2015, Wize Israel engaged in various businesses and in February 2015 Wize Israel became a public shell company.
 
In December 2014, an Israeli court approved a creditors arrangement (the “Creditors’ Arrangement”) under the Israeli Companies Law between Wize Israel (then known as Star Night Technologies Ltd.), its creditors and its shareholders, in which Wize Israel was purchased by a group of investors led by Ridge. Upon the completion of the Creditors’ Arrangement, all of Wize Israel’s assets, rights and obligations were transferred to the creditors’ arrangement fund, so that Wize Israel’s equity after the approval of such arrangement was zero and Wize Israel remained a public shell company without any activity, rights or obligations. The Creditors’ Arrangement was completed in February 2015.
 
Below is a summary of the major business developments in Wize Israel following the completion of the Creditors’ Arrangement and prior to the Merger:
 

● | On May 1, 2015, Wize Israel entered into an Exclusive Distribution and Licensing Agreement with Resdevco Ltd. (“Resdevco”), as amended and supplemented thereafter (the “LO2A License Agreement”), whereby Resdevco granted to Wize Israel an exclusive license to purchase, market, sell and distribute LO2A in the United States, Israel and Ukraine as well as a contingent right to do the same in other countries. For more information about the LO2A License Agreement, see under “- LO2A License Agreement,” beginning on page 8 of this report. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Between April 2015 and August 2017, Wize Israel entered into a series of equity and debt financings, raising a total of approximately NIS 12.6 million (approximately $3.7 million). For more information about these financings, see “MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,” beginning on page 60 of this report. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In August 2016, Wize Israel commenced a Phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LO2A for patients suffering from moderate to severe CCH.

The Market Opportunity
 
We (through Wize Israel) have licensed certain rights to purchase, market, sell and distribute LO2A for the treatment of DES and other ophthalmological illnesses, including CCH and Sjögren’s in the United States, Israel, Ukraine, China and have an option to purchase the rights to additional territories as further described in the LO2A License Agreement below. We have determined not to pursue any activities in the Ukraine for the moment and specifically not until we will obtain from the inventor a regulatory file with DES and additional indications such as CCH or Sjögren’s.
 
Dry Eye Syndrome: DES is an eye disease caused by eye dryness, which, in turn, is caused by either decreased tear production or increased tear film evaporation. The tear film is comprised of the lower mucous layer which helps the tear film adhere to the eyes, a middle layer of water and an upper oil layer that seals the tear film and prevents evaporation. The tear film keeps the eye moist, creates a smooth surface for light to pass through the eye, nourishes the front of the eye and provides protection from injury and infection. DES is usually caused by aqueous tear deficiency, or inadequate tear production, whereby the lachrymal gland, the gland that secretes the aqueous layer of the tear film, does not produce sufficient tears to keep the entire conjunctiva, or the tissue inside the eyelids that covers the sclera, and cornea covered by a complete layer of tear film. In rare cases, aqueous tear deficiency may be a symptom of collagen vascular diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, Wegener’s granulomatosis, an incurable form of vasculitis (the inflammatory destruction of blood vessels), systemic lupus erythematosus, an autoimmune connective tissue disease, Sjögren’s, an autoimmune process in which patients suffer from mouth and eye dryness, and autoimmune diseases associated with Sjögren’s. DES can also be caused by abnormal tear composition resulting in rapid evaporation or premature destruction of tears. Additional causes include, but are not limited to, age, use of certain drugs and the use of contact lenses.
 
DES is characterized by eye irritation symptoms, blurred and fluctuating vision, tear film instability, increased tear osmolarity and ocular surface epithelial disease. DES causes constant ocular discomfort, typically dryness, burning, a sandy-gritty eye irritation and a decrease in visual function. Over an extended period of time, DES can lead to tiny abrasions on the surface of the eyes. In advanced cases, the epithelium undergoes pathologic changes, namely squamous metaplasia, a non-cancerous change of surface-lining cells, and loss of goblet cells, which secrete mucin, which in turn dissolves in water to form mucous. Some severe cases result in thickening of the corneal surface, corneal erosion, epithelial defects, corneal ulceration (sterile and infected), corneal neovascularization, or excessive ingrowth of blood vessels, corneal scarring, corneal thinning, and even corneal perforation. In the most severe cases, DES may result in deterioration of vision.
 
In a GlobalData Dry Eye Syndrome report (the “GlobalData Report”), it was estimated that in 2016, pharmaceutical sales within the DES market were approximately $2.2 billion across the 8 major markets, with the US contributing 79.6% of these sales, and GlobalData expects that by 2026 those sales are expected to grow to $5.6 billion. According to the GlobalData Report, the major drivers of growth of DES include the introduction of novel drugs, an increasingly aging society and increasing urbanized living with greater use of computers and better disease awareness leading to increased diagnosis and treatment rates. In addition, extended viewing of television, computer and smartphone screens, weather conditions, exposure to air conditioning and increased life expectancy are additional factors that contribute to the increase in the number of those suffering from DES.
 
Conjunctivochalasis: CCH refers to the presence of redundant folds of loose conjunctiva. CCH is thought to be caused by both a gradual thinning and stretching of the conjunctiva that accompanies age and a loss of adhesion between the conjunctiva and underlying sclera due to the dissolution of Tenon’s capsule. A correlation may also exist between eye inflammation and CCH, though it is unclear if this correlation is causal. CCH may also be associated with previous surgery, blepharitis, Meibomian gland disorder, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and aqueous tear deficiency. The resulting loose, excess conjunctiva may mechanically irritate the eye and disrupt the tear film and its outflow, leading to dry eye and excess tearing. Most patients with CCH complain of foreign body sensation, tearing, difficulty reading, blurred vision, “red eyes” and general irritation.

Lid Parallel Conjunctival Folds (“LIPCOF”) grading measures the number and severity of the lid-parallel conjunctival folds. LIPCOF grade 0 signifies the absence of conjunctival folds, LIPCOF grade 1 signifies just one conjunctival fold, LIPCOF grade 2 signifies for multiple conjunctival folds, not extending beyond the tear meniscus, and LIPCOF grade 3 signifies multiple conjunctival folds extending above the tear meniscus. The LIPCOF grades show a strong correlation with both the subjective and objective complaints of DES, as well as with the severity of the disease.
 
The treatment of LIPCOF grade 3 CCH usually requires invasive therapies like surgery or treatment of the conjunctival folds with argon laser or with heat cauterization. A previous study conducted by Resdevco in 2013, has shown Conheal® (Hungarian brand name for LO2A) to be effective in reducing the severity of CCH as measured by a reduction in the (i) LIPCOF score, (ii) Oxford scheme grade and (iii) ocular surface disease index (“OSDI”) and an increase in tear film break-up time (“TFBUT”). This raises the possibility that vision-related quality of life can be significantly improved by conservative therapies even in severe CCH.
 
There is little epidemiological data for CCH. A community based study in Shanghai reported that in patients over the age of 60, 4% had LIPCOF grade 3 CCH and 16% had LIPCOF grade 2 CCH. In the European Union, about 20% of the population is over the age of 65. From the aforementioned data, it might be assumed, as presented in a study conducted by Dr. Huba J. Kiss and János Németh, that in the total European Union population, 0.8% have LIPCOF grade 3 CCH and 3.2% have LIPCOF grade 2 CCH. Since DES complaints occur in 5.5% to 33.7% of the population, Dr. Kiss and Németh further assumed that the incidence of the CCH-caused DES in the population is about one-third of all DES cases.
 
Sjögren’s syndrome: Sjögren’s syndrome is a heterogeneous, chronic, inflammatory, autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of exocrine glands and expression of autoantibodies including antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-Ro (also termed anti SSA), anti-La (also termed anti SSB) as well as rheumatoid factor (RF). Hypergammaglobulinemia is common as well. Sjögren’s may be an isolated disease, termed primary Sjögren’s syndrome or may accompany another autoimmune diseases, such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, or scleroderma, thus termed secondary Sjögren’s syndrome. Clinical presentation varies from mild symptoms such as classic sicca symptoms of dry eyes (xerophthalmia), dry mouth (xerostomia) and parotid gland enlargements to severe systemic symptoms involving multiple organ systems such as fever, fatigue, malaise, arthritis, arthralgia, myalgia, interstitial lung disease, kidney disease, gastrointestinal disease and neurological manifestations. Sjögren’s treatment is highly individualized and is based on a patient’s disease severity, organ involvement and previous response. Mild forms of Sjögren’s may be treated symptomatically with artificial tears and salivary flow stimulation. More severe, systemic manifestations may be treated with high-dose glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive or cytotoxic drugs to suppress the immune system.
 
Estimations of Sjögren’s prevalence vary from 2.5 million to 4 million patients (Sjögren’s Syndrome Foundation) in the US alone, with a worldwide estimate of up to 7.7 million in the 7 Major Markets (US, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK and Japan) by the year 2024 (Global Data Research). Sjögren’s affects mostly middle aged women (40-50 years of age) with a female to male prevalence ratio of 9:1.
 
Global Data estimates the drug sales for Sjögren’s in 2014 were approximately $1.1 billion across the markets covered in its forecast. By the end of the forecast period of 2024, sales are estimated to grow to $2.2 billion across the markets covered in its forecast with a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 7.2%. The market size estimate in 2014 includes Salagen (pilocarpine) and Evoxac (cevimeline), the only two agents to ever be approved for Sjögren’s, and the use of off-label agents, such as biologics approved for other autoimmune diseases, and systemic and topical immunosuppressants and corticosteroids. This growth is expected to be driven by the anticipated approval of Orencia for use in patients with Sjögren’s in the US and EU in 2021 and Japan in 2022.

LO2A License Agreement
 
The following summary of the LO2A License Agreement as well as all summaries of agreements provided herein are qualified to the full text of the agreements, which are filed as exhibits hereto.
 
In May 2015, Wize Israel entered into the LO2A License Agreement with Resdevco, a company controlled by Professor Shabtay Dikstein, the inventor of LO2A. Pursuant to the LO2A License Agreement, Resdevco granted to Wize Israel (and thereafter, to OcuWize Ltd. (“OcuWize”), Wize Israel’s wholly owned subsidiary, as described below) an exclusive license to develop in the United States, Israel and Ukraine, under the LO2A licensed technology, products in the field of ophthalmic disorders, and to mutually agree upon a manufacturer and to purchase, market, sell and distribute LO2A in finished product form in the Licensed Territories in the field of ophthalmic disorders. Subject to certain limited exceptions, Wize Israel may not sublicense or sell or transfer any of its rights under the LO2A License Agreement without the advance written approval of Resdevco. We have determined not to pursue any activities in the Ukraine for the moment and specifically not until we will obtain from the inventor a regulatory file with DES and additional indications such as CCH or Sjögren’s.  
 
The LO2A License Agreement grants Wize Israel the right to add additional territories in the future, subject to a commitment by Wize Israel to pay minimum royalties according to a formula set forth in the LO2A License Agreement with respect to the additional territory, and provided that Resdevco has not granted exclusive rights in such additional territory or is in ongoing negotiations. The LO2A License Agreement also grants Wize Israel the right to purchase Resdevco’s agreements with its existing distributors of LO2A in other jurisdictions (namely, Germany, Hungary, Netherlands and Switzerland (collectively, the “Reserved Territories”) for ten times the greater of the net royalties received in the previous 12 months under such agreements or the minimum royalty payment under such agreements. The LO2A License Agreement furthermore grants Wize Israel a right of first negotiation with potential distributors to whom Resdevco may in the future grant distribution rights to LO2A outside of the Reserved Territories and the Licensed Territories and provides that if Wize Israel enters into such distribution agreement in accordance with the LO2A License Agreement, then Wize Israel has agreed to guarantee in writing to Resdevco that it will pay to Resdevco minimum royalties according to a formula set forth in the LO2A License Agreement. The LO2A License Agreement historically included an option to purchase all remaining territories for a fixed amount and such option was cancelled on March 30, 2017.
 
The LO2A License Agreement provides that Wize Israel is required to pay to Resdevco certain royalties for sales in the Licensed Territories based on an agreed-upon price per unit of (i) $0.60 in Israel, (ii) the low single digits in US dollars in China, and (iii) for sales in additional territories and in the United States, the higher of $0.60 and a percentage of net sales (not to exceed ten percent) for the duration of the local distribution agreement signed separately with each local distributor, which royalties, as applicable, are subject to making certain minimum royalty payments, which (1) with respect to the United States, means the non-refundable and non-deductible aggregate amount of $400,000 over a period of three years commencing from 2015 (which amount was already fully paid by Wize Israel) and an advance against royalties of $150,000 per year from 2018 through 2021, and then $475,000 per year, which annual advance shall be credited towards any royalties payable to Resdevco for that particular year, and (2) with respect to Israel, means an upfront non-refundable and non-deductible payment of $30,000, payable at commencement of local sales, and an annual advance against royalties starting January 1, 2017 in increasing payments depending on the year (up to a maximum of $36,000) which annual advance shall be credited towards any royalties payable to Resdevco for that particular year, and (3) with respect to Ukraine, means an annual advance against royalties, starting in 2016, in increasing payments depending on the year (up to a maximum of $30,000), which yearly advance shall be credited towards any royalties payable to Resdevco for that particular year. We have determined not to pursue any activities in the Ukraine for the moment and specifically not until we will obtain from the inventor a regulatory file with DES and additional indications such as CCH or Sjögren’s. 
 
On January 5, 2017, Wize Israel and Resdevco entered into an amendment to the LO2A License Agreement, pursuant to which the payment of $150,000 that Wize Israel was obligated to pay to Resdevco on January 1, 2017, was postponed to March 31, 2017. On March 30, 2017, Wize Israel and Resdevco entered into a second amendment to the LO2A License Agreement, pursuant to which the payment of $150,000 was further postponed to May 31, 2017. In the end of May 2017, the parties agreed to postpone the aforementioned payment to the beginning of July 2017, when the payment was made. In the end of December 2017, Resdevco notified Wize Israel that the minimum royalty payment with respect to the United States would be postponed until January 20, 2018 and in January 2018, Resdevco agreed to postpone such payment until July 29, 2018. In February 2019, Wize Israel and Resdevco agreed that Wize Israel shall pay Resdevco minimum yearly payments of $150,000 per year through 2021, and then annual payments of $475,00 per year, and shall pay Resdevco $650,000 within two years after receipt of FDA approval for eye drops utilizing the licensed technology.

The LO2A License Agreement has an initial term of seven years that expires in May 2022, and, unless Wize Israel provides prior notice of at least 12 months terminating the agreement, the LO2A License Agreement renews automatically each year. Wize Israel may terminate the LO2A License Agreement prior to May 2022 upon 180 days prior notice; provided that all payments previously made to Resdevco shall be non-refundable, any payments due during the 180 day notice period shall be payable to Resdevco and Wize Israel is required to pay a penalty of $100,000, depending on the timing of termination. Additionally, if Wize Israel terminates the LO2A License Agreement, it is required to exert reasonable best efforts to find a third party willing to sell LO2A under the same terms as the LO2A License Agreement. The LO2A License Agreement may be terminated by either party upon the occurrence of certain other customary termination triggers, including material breaches of the LO2A License Agreement by either party, as well as the right of Resdevco to terminate the LO2A License Agreement (or halt the manufacturing agreement or cease delivery of any finished product for any period of time) as a result of Wize Israel not paying all royalties due under the LO2A License Agreement. In addition, Resdevco may terminate the LO2A License Agreement, upon 30 days written notice, if (1) an application for the marketing approval of LO2A, for the treatment of DES is not submitted to the FDA or the equivalent regulatory authority in the Licensed Territories by May 1, 2019, (2) such FDA approval is not obtained from the FDA or the equivalent regulatory authority in the Licensed Territories by May 1, 2021, (3) such approval has been obtained, commercial sales of LO2A have not commenced within three months thereafter, (4) commercial sales of LO2A have commenced, any royalties, including any minimum royalties are not timely paid, or (5) Wize Israel attempts to sell competing products in or outside the Licensed Territory. Resdevco may also terminate the LO2A License Agreement if Wize Israel contests the validity of any patents covering LO2A or any related know-how or if Wize Israel makes, sells or exploits a competing product to LO2A.
 
The LO2A License Agreement contains other provisions, including representations and warranties of the parties, reporting, confidentiality and other covenants, such as an undertaking by Wize Israel not to sell competing products in the Licensed Territories during the term of the agreement and for five years thereafter. The LO2A License Agreement further provides that any improvements or modifications made by Wize Israel to LO2A or any related intellectual property or know-how shall belong to Resdevco and Wize Israel shall receive a license to distribute and sell the same in the Licensed Territories on the same terms set forth in the LO2A License Agreement.
 
In order to secure Wize Israel’s obligations and performance pursuant to Convertible Loans made by Rimon Gold, Wize Israel’s rights under the LO2A License Agreement serve as collateral. For details related to those security interests, see “MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,” beginning on page 60 of this report.
 
In August 2016, Resdevco granted Wize Israel an option to purchase its ownership rights to LO2A, including the patents and trademarks thereunder, except in countries in which LO2A is already sold by Resdevco. In accordance with the terms of this option, Wize Israel was required to pay for such ownership rights a non-recurring payment of $440,000 as well as royalties from future sales of LO2A and to issue an option to purchase 41,667 of its ordinary shares. This option expired on December 31, 2016.
 
In August 2016, Wize Israel and Resdevco also entered into an agreement pursuant to which Wize Israel assigned all of its rights and obligations under the LO2A License Agreement to OcuWize.
 
On September 6, 2017, Resdevco granted to Wize Israel, sole rights to commercialize LO2A in China. By agreement dated September 25, 2017, Wize Israel and Resdevco agreed that Wize Israel’s sole rights to commercialize LO2A in China would be limited to one year if by September 6, 2018, Wize Israel had not signed a distribution agreement for LO2A in China. On May 31, 2018, we entered into the Chinese Distribution Agreement (as defined below), pursuant to which the Chinese Distributor will distribute LO2A in China. As a result of us entering into the Chinese Distribution Agreement, Wize Israel’s sole rights to commercialize LO2A in China shall not be limited to one year. See “BUSINESS — Marketing, Sales and Distribution,” beginning on page 18 of this report.

On December 26, 2017 Wize Israel, entered into an amendment to the LO2A License Agreement (the “Third Amendment”). The Third Amendment includes: (i) China in the list of Licensed Territories, (ii) the commercial terms of the parties with respect to the activities of Wize Israel in China, including the minimum annual royalty payments from Wize Israel to Resdevco, and, (iii) an undertaking by Wize Israel to include in the distribution agreement to be entered into with the Chinese Distributor that the Chinese Distributor will transfer the Chinese market license to Resdevco upon termination of the distribution agreement. In the event Wize Israel failed to execute a distribution agreement with the Chinese Distributor by June 1, 2018, the Third Amendment would have been deemed null, void and of no force. On May 31, 2018, we entered into the Chinese Distribution Agreement (as defined below). As a result of us entering into the Chinese Distribution Agreement, the term of the Third Amendment did not expire on June 1, 2018. See “BUSINESS — Marketing, Sales and Distribution,” beginning on page 18 of this report.
 
On January 8, 2018, Wize Israel entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (the “MOU”) with Resdevco. Pursuant to the MOU, Resdevco granted to Wize Israel (and its permitted assignees) an exclusive royalty bearing license to sell and distribute worldwide (excluding the United States, Israel, Ukraine, Switzerland, Germany, Netherlands and China, the “Additional Territories”), under the LO2A licensed technology, products in the field of ophthalmic disorders, under the terms and conditions set forth in the MOU, including the following: (i) the license for each Additional Territory shall be conditional on signing a specific license agreement for each Additional Territory that shall include the basic terms and conditions set forth in the MOU, including reaching minimum sales targets in such Additional Territory pursuant to a formula set forth in the MOU; (ii) for each Additional Territory, both Wize Israel and the local distributor shall be responsible to pay Resdevco a minimum per product fee in accordance with a formula set forth in the MOU and the agreement with the distributor shall be subject to Resdevco’s prior approval (which shall not be unreasonably withheld); (iii) if Resdevco introduces Wize Israel to a distributor in any Additional Territory, Wize Israel will enter good faith negotiations with such distributor and, if Wize Israel does not reach an agreement with such distributor, Resdevco may enter into a distribution agreement with such distributor, in which case, Wize Israel will provide the services it typically provides to its other distributors in consideration for a portion of the royalties payable to Resdevco; and (iv) the license granted under the MOU is for an initial term of 5 years and, thereafter, automatically renews for additional terms of 5 years each, subject to full compliance with the terms set forth in the MOU and as long as the LO2A License Agreement is in effect. The MOU provides that it shall be in effect until a definitive agreement reflecting the terms of the MOU is executed, which the parties committed to exercise their best efforts to do within three months. The MOU also provides that it will terminate by June 30, 2019 if the Company has not completed certain clinical trials by such date. The Company does not expect to complete these trials within such time period.
 
LO2A
 
LO2A is a drug developed by Prof. Dikstein in the 1990s, initially for the treatment of DES, and later on for other ophthalmological disorders, including CCH and Sjögren’s. LO2A is a sterile, preservative-free, single-dose artificial tear preparation containing 0.015% sodium hyaluronate (“SH”) as the drug substance. It has been developed as a substitute for natural tears, in order to lubricate and protect the ocular surface tissues.
 
SH is a salt of hyaluronic acid (“HA”). HA is present in the extracellular matrix (“ECM”) of all tissues and is particularly abundant in vitreous humour, skin, cartilage and the synovial fluid of joints. HA’s long chain molecules form a filter matrix interspersed with cellular fluids, which provide visco-elastic properties to the tissues. In the eye, endogenous HA forms a layer over the surface of the cornea. It serves to protect the corneal cells and reduce cell damage; so it is important in maintaining cell viability.
 
HA is an important pericellular and cell-surface constituent and is involved in the regulation of cellular activity through its interaction with other macromolecules. Recently, nonclinical pharmacological experiments have shown that HA promotes the viability of corneal cells and corneal epithelial wound healing by direct interaction with cell receptors. It acts as a signaling molecule in the ECM and is a ligand for specific receptor molecules, notably CD44, a cell surface adhesion molecule found on human corneal cells. Increased expression of CD44 receptors has been shown to be associated with corneal re-epithelialization. Any disruption of corneal integrity, as may occur with dry eyes, triggers the re-synthesis of HA and increases cell proliferation. These effects have been demonstrated to be dose-dependent.

LO2A eye drops incorporate a high molecular weight SH (1.5-1.65 million Da), which enables it to be effective in solution at a low concentration. It confers specific physical properties upon a solution. Its complex molecular structure, adsorbs a relatively high volume of water, so that the solution takes on a gelatinous form. This water is released upon an increase in pressure. The viscosity of high MW SH is affected by shear rate; at high shear rate the macromolecules change their shape, align in the treatment of flow and its viscosity decreases. This enables the LO2A solution to flow across the corneal surface immediately after blinking. The physiochemical property of SH is similar to that of mucin, which constitutes the base layer of the lacrimal film and interacts strongly with the corneo-conjunctival surface. Molecules of mucin are able to bind water molecules up to 80 times greater in weight than their own. This is due to a large number of negatively-charged glycoside groups that are attached to the terminal section of the polypeptide skeleton.
 
All excipients included in LO2A eye drops comply with the relevant monographs of the European Pharmacopoeia. None of the excipients are of animal or human origin. They are established excipients for pharmaceutical products, including those approved for ocular use. Their functions include adjusting tonicity and increasing the viscosity of the formulation. This allows the LO2A eye drops to have a lubricating effect that is compatible with the external ocular environment. The visco-elasticity of LO2A eye drops ensures that they are retained on the corneal surface for a period of 4-6 hours, as demonstrated in a Phase I clinical pharmacology study conducted with LO2A in the University Hospital of Antwerp, Belgium in 1992. In this Phase I, randomized, blinded, cross-over study, fluorescence was used to measure pre-corneal retention time in healthy volunteers following a single instillation of LO2A and placebo (isotonic phosphate buffered saline) both labeled with fluorescein. The study compared the elimination coefficient and area under fluorescence decay curve for LO2A versus placebo.
 
LO2A eye drops do not contain any preservatives. This is an important feature of the formulation as preservatives have a recognized potential for irritation and sensitization and can damage the ocular surface and the cornea. This is of particular relevance to patients with symptoms of DES, in whom the corneal surface is already compromised.
 
The adverse events reported both from clinical trials of LO2A and from literature reports of different eye drop formulations containing SH, were minor ocular events which are expected to occur with any ophthalmic formulation. LO2A eye drops are presented in sterile, unit-dose vials to minimize the risk of infection and contamination.
 
We believe that the properties of the LO2A formulation described above make it a suitable candidate for use in a variety of dry eye indications including those with an inflammatory component. LO2A is currently registered and marketed in Germany and Switzerland for the treatment of DES, in Hungary for the treatment of DES, CCH and Sjögren’s and in the Netherlands for the treatment of DES and Sjögren’s. LO2A is sold under the brand name Hylan® in Germany and the Netherlands, Lacrycon® in Switzerland, and Conheal® in Hungary. LO2A has been sold by Resdevco through local distributors in these countries for a number of years. In these countries, the drug is sold in a unit dose format, and is manufactured in Germany and France. We currently intend to market LO2A as a treatment for DES, CCH and Sjögren’s in the Licensed Territories, and believe that LO2A for treatment of ophthalmic inflammatory disorders such as CCH and Sjögren’s presents a significant market opportunity.
 
We intend to distribute LO2A via local or multi-national distributors, including by cooperation with a major medical company with means and experience in the end processes of approving and marketing drugs. In order to register LO2A for the treatment of dry eye patients suffering from CCH and Sjögren’s, we estimate that LO2A will be required to undergo additional clinical trials in addition to the Phase II and Phase IV clinical trials that we are currently conducting.
 
The following paragraphs describe the non-clinical and clinical data upon which approvals were granted.
 
Non-clinical data
 
A summary of the toxicology studies conducted on LO2A and the drug substance is provided in Table 1 below. The acute and sub-acute toxicity studies conducted with the drug substance and LO2A demonstrated a low order of toxicity. This is in-line with published reports of acute toxicity studies conducted with SH administered to rodents and other species, including beagle dogs. Similarly, literature reports of sub-acute and chronic toxicity studies conducted in a wide range of species using different exposure routes, including ocular application, have repeatedly demonstrated that it did not cause significant toxic effects.

The systemic absorption of SH is clinically negligible and published reproductive and developmental toxicity tests have demonstrated that it does not cause any teratogenic effects or adverse effects on reproduction. Animal studies have shown that it is secreted into breast milk after parenteral injection, but no adverse effects were caused in the young.
 
Ocular tolerance studies have been conducted with the drug substance and LO2A solution. Sodium hyaluronate was found to cause mild irritation when applied in powder form to the eyes of rabbits; the signs of irritation were more frequent and more severe in the group that did not receive eye irrigation immediately after instillation. In such studies, no other macroscopic ocular findings were reported. A further 28-day study of the primary eye irritation of LO2A solution in rabbits caused mild ocular irritation; all other ocular and systemic investigations revealed no adverse effects. In both of these studies all signs of irritation had resolved within 48 hours. Application of the concentrated drug substance would be expected to cause a degree of non-specific irritation, by virtue of its physical presence in the eye.
 
After instillation of eye drops, there is inevitably a degree of spillage onto surrounding skin. Therefore, a standard skin sensitization study was conducted on LO2A. This demonstrated that it had no sensitization potential. This is in-line with published reports of skin irritation and sensitizing studies conducted in guinea pigs and rabbits.
 
The drug substance was shown not to be mutagenic in a bacterial mutation test. Published reports of the chromosome aberration and mouse micronucleus tests confirm that it is not mutagenic or genotoxic. No carcinogenicity testing has been conducted, but SH has well-established safety for long-term use.

Clinical Data
 
A pivotal clinical trial conducted with LO2A eye drops in six centers in France, is summarized below. There are a further seven published clinical studies on LO2A, which are also summarized. Six of these studies documented the efficacy of LO2A eye drops by both the Investigators and the patients. Adverse events and tolerance parameters were also recorded. The remaining study specifically investigated tolerance parameters after application of LO2A eye drops. No clinical Pharmacokinetics studies have been conducted for LO2A eye drops. The PK profile of SH is well established. Extensive safety monitoring in both animal and human studies have shown that, after ocular application, no clinically meaningful systemic absorption is expected.
 
A Phase I study was performed at the University of Antwerp, Belgium in 1992 to measure the pre-corneal residence time of LO2A eye drops versus placebo in healthy volunteers (Study EC-914-1B). This was a single blind study in which 6 healthy volunteers received a single administration of LO2A eye drops to one eye and placebo to the other eye, both labeled with fluorescein. Variance analysis (ANOVA) for the area under the fluorescence delay curve demonstrated that LO2A was retained on the corneal surface significantly longer than placebo eye drops (p=0.048; significance level p=0.05). No adverse events were reported.
 
Six Phase II studies were performed. These are described below:
 
Randomized Controlled Trial of High Molecular Weight Hyaluronic Acid (LO2A) in DES 
 
This study was performed in 1992 at the Hospital San Biagio, Domodossola, Italy. The objectives of the study were to evaluate the efficacy of 30-day treatment with LO2A in reducing the severity of DES, to confirm an optimum dosing schedule for LO2A (3, 4, 6 or 8 drops/day) and to assess the interference of LO2A with other ocular therapies. One hundred patients with moderate-to-severe DES were randomized 1:1 to treatment (LO2A) or comparator (Hyalistil containing 0.2% SH and the preservative thimerosal at 0.005%). Statistical analyses were performed using Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney U test and Chi square test. The significance level was p=0.05.
 
The study demonstrated significant improvement in composite score from objective parameters including Schirmer test, fluorescein staining, TFBUT and Rose Bengal staining (p<0.001 for both treatments using Wilcoxon test), but no significant difference between treatment groups in the reduction in total scores at Day 30 (p=0.998 using Mann-Whitney U test). For LO2A, a dosing schedule of four applications/day reduced scores at Day 30 significantly more than lower dosing schedules (p=0.02 using Mann-Whitney U test). There was no significant difference between 4 applications/day and higher dosing schedules. The number of patients rating tolerance as ‘good’ or above was significantly higher for LO2A (96%) than the comparator (78%)(p = 0.029 using Chi square test). Adverse events were experienced by two patients in the LO2A group (both “sticky eye”) and 11 patients in the comparator group. There were no serious adverse events (“SAEs”) or apparent interactions between LO2A and concomitant eye treatments.

Double-Masked, Crossover Comparison of a New Artificial Tear Preparation containing Hyaluronic Acid (LO2A) and Lacrisol® in DES Treatment 
 
This study was performed in 1992 at the University of Florence, Italy. The objectives of the study were to compare the efficacy of LO2A with Lacrisol® at reducing the severity of DES and reducing ocular signs and symptoms. Thirty-five patients with moderate-to-severe DES were treated alternately with LO2A for a 30-day treatment period and then Lacrisol® for a further 30-day treatment period. The trial was double-blind and allocation of treatments at Day 0 was randomized. Lacrisol® is an eye drop product containing 0.5% Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose (“HPMC”). Statistical analyses were performed using Wilcoxon tests. All analyses were performed using two-sided tests and results were considered to be statistically significant if the p value was less than or equal to 0.05.
 
This study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in mean, objective dry eye score (based on Schirmer test, fluorescein staining, TFBUT and Rose Bengal staining) following LO2A treatment compared to the Lacrisol® group (p<0.001). The severity of ocular signs and symptoms including redness, burning, foreign body sensation and photophobia was significantly less following LO2A treatment (p<0.02 for photophobia and p<0.01 for other symptoms). Adverse events were experienced by 4 patients treated with LO2A (two patients with mild burning, one patient with blurred vision and one patient with “thread sensation”) and 10 patients treated with Lacrisol®. There were no SAEs reported.
 
Double-Masked Clinical Trial of an Unpreserved Hyaluronic Acid Based Eye Drops (LO2A) in DES 
 
This study was performed in 1992 at the University of Genoa, Italy. The objective of the study was to compare the efficacy of LO2A with Lacrisol® in reducing the severity of DES and ocular symptoms. Twenty-three patients with moderate to severe DES applied LO2A to the first eye and Lacrisol® (0.5% HPMC) to the second eye. The trial was double-blind and the treatment regime was five applications/day for 30 days. The recorded data were statistically analyzed by using the Student’s t test and Mann-Whitney U test. The threshold for clinical significance was p=0.05.
 
This study demonstrated that after 30 days of treatment the mean, objective dry eye scores (based on measurement of meniscal thickness, fluorescein staining, TFBUT and Rose Bengal staining) for LO2A treatment were significantly lower than for Lacrisol® treatment for three out of the four tests (p=0.011 for TFBUT [Student t test], p=0.046 for fluorescein staining [Mann-Whitney U test] and p=0.032 for Rose Bengal staining [Mann-Whitney U test]). The thickness of the lacrimal meniscus did not change significantly in any patient; however, the range of values recorded at Day 0 (0.1-0.2 mm) was not indicative of pathological changes. The severity of the ocular symptoms (burning, foreign body sensation and photophobia) was also significantly reduced for LO2A treatment compared to Lacrisol® at Day 30 (p=0.009 for burning, p=0.006 for foreign body sensation and p=0.025 for photophobia using Mann-Whitney U test). There were no adverse events associated with LO2A treatment.
 
Clinical Evaluation of LO2A Eye Drops versus Reference in Patients suffering from DES
 
This study was performed in 1992 at the University of Rome “Tor Vergata”, Italy. The objective of the study was to compare the efficacy of LO2A with eye drops containing 0.5% HPMC in reducing the severity of DES. Sixteen patients were treated with LO2A or HPMC eye drops. The study was double blind and assessed the treatment of 5 drops/day for 3-4 weeks. The data were statistically analyzed by comparing the scores obtained by the Wilcoxon test and adopting a significance threshold of p = 0.05. This study demonstrated that LO2A eye drops had significantly lower scores than HPMC in the fluorescein (p=0.001), TFBUT (p=0.015) and Rose Bengal test (p=0.007). There was no difference between treatments in meniscal thickness measurements and Schirmer tests. Adverse events were reported by one patient treated with LO2A (blurred vision). There were no SAEs reported.

Assessment of Tolerance to LO2A Eye Drops 
 
This study was performed at the University of Catania, Italy in 1992. The objective of the study was to assess the ocular tolerance of patients with moderate to severe DES to the application of LO2A drops compared with eye drops containing 0.5% HPMC. Eighteen patients applied LO2A drops to the first eye and HPMC in the second eye. The study was double-blind and assessed treatment of 4 drops/day for 20 days. This study demonstrated that 11 out of 18 patients (61.1%) experienced no discomfort upon application of LO2A compared to 1 out of 18 patients (5.6%)) with HPMC eye drops. This difference was found to be highly significant (p=0.0004) according to chi-squared test (significance level was p=0.05). The subjective symptoms reported at the time of HPMC instillation included blurred vision (16/18; 89%), foreign body sensation (11/18; 61%), stinging (7/18; 39%), photophobia (2/18; 11%) itching (1/18; 6%) and pain (1/18; 6%). The subjective symptoms reported at the time of LO2A instillation included foreign body sensation (5/18; 28%), stinging (4/18; 22%), blurred vision (3/18; 17%) and photophobia (2/18; 11%). No SAEs were reported.
The Effect of a New Tear Substitute Containing Glycerol and Hyaluronate on Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca
 
This study was performed in 1998 at Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel. The objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of LO2A in patients suffering from keratoconjunctivitis sicca compared to their current tear substitute. Twenty-five patients with a history of dry eye symptoms for at least one year who were using a known tear substitute preparation (containing either cellulose derivatives or polyvinylpyrolidone plus hydroxyethylcellulose) and had positive Rose Bengal staining were included. One eye was randomized to topical treatment with LO2A and the other “control” eye to continued treatment with the pre-existing tear substitute preparation. In the first stage of the study, 15 patients received treatment for one week and in the second stage, 10 patients received treatment for two weeks. Statistical analysis of the results included the Wilcoxon signed rank test for comparison between scores for the same eye at different times, and Mann-Whitney test for comparison between scores of study versus control eyes adopting a significance threshold of p = 0.05.
 
The average patient satisfaction score for LO2A was significantly higher compared to the control preparation at 1 week (p=0.0003) and at 2 weeks (p=0.0232). A highly significant reduction in Rose Bengal staining was demonstrated following one week of treatment with LO2A (p<0.0001) and the LO2A-treated eyes had significantly less staining compared to control eyes at both one (p=0.021) and two weeks (p=0.023). The paper did not report any adverse events associated with LO2A treatment.
 
The pivotal, Phase III study is described below:
 
Acceptability and Efficacy of LO2A Eye Drops vs Gel-Larmes® in Moderate to Severe DES - Clinical Trial Protocol No. EC-921-3
 
This study was performed in 1993 at the Hospital Hôtel-Dieu, Paris, France with additional sites in Brest, Montpellier, Limoges, Lyon and Nice. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the superiority of LO2A to Gel-Larmes® (0.3% Carbomer containing the preservative thimerosal at 0.005%) in improving patient symptoms and to demonstrate equivalence of the study treatments in reducing the severity of DES. One hundred patients with moderate to severe DES were randomized 1:1 to treatment (LO2A) or Gel-Larmes®. The study assessed treatment of four applications/day for 12 weeks. Differences between the study treatment groups were analyzed statistically using either the Student’s t test (means) or Chi squared test (percentages). Equivalence between the treatment groups was tested by comparison of distributions using the Dunett and Gent’s Chi squared test. Probability level was 0.05.
 
This study demonstrated that LO2A was significantly superior to Gel-Larmes® in improving patient symptoms (p=0.024). The severity of DES was measured using Schirmer test, fluorescein staining, TFBUT and Rose Bengal staining. A reduction in total score of ≥4, obtained from these four objective tests, was achieved by 17 patients (left eye) and 23 patients (right eye) in the LO2A group and by 20 patients (left eye) and 16 patients (right eye) in the Gel-Larmes® group, demonstrating that LO2A and Gel-Larmes® were equivalent in improving signs of DES (probability of equivalence: p=0.039 right eye and p=0.00002 left eye). The number of patients rating tolerance as ‘good’ or above was significantly higher in the LO2A group compared to Gel-Larmes® at all time points (Days 15 - p=0.031; Day 45 -p=0.00006; Day 90 - p=0.0004). Adverse events were experienced by 10 patients (21.7%) in the LO2A group and 17 patients (36.2%) in the Gel-Larmes® group. The adverse events experienced by patients in the LO2A group included inflammatory reaction (2 patients), burning/itching/stinging sensation (7 patients) and secretions (1 patient). One unrelated SAE was reported in this study (chest pain) in a patient randomized to the Gel-Larmes® group. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that LO2A was significantly better than Gel-Larmes® in terms of subjective symptoms and tolerability in treating DES with a treatment regimen of four drops/day for 12 weeks and equivalent in improving signs of DES.

A Phase II study was performed at Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary between 2012-2013 to assess the efficacy of LO2A eye drops in patients with severe CCH. Twenty patients with Grade 2 or 3 CCH (according to LIPCOF score), who had previously failed treatment on a variety of artificial tear preparations, applied LO2A eye drops to both eyes in a single arm, open label study. Patients applied 4 drops/day for each eye for 3 months. A mean decrease from baseline of one LIPCOF degree was assumed to be clinically relevant. Statistical comparisons were performed using a paired t-test (TFBUT) or Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test (LIPCOF degree, Oxford grade and OSDI score) at a two-sided significance level of 5% (p=0.05).
 
This study demonstrated that after 3 months, CCH decreased from a mean LIPCOF degree of 2.9±0.4 in both eyes to 1.4±0.6 on the right (median decrease of -2 points, 95% confidence interval (“CI”) from -2.0 to -1.0), and to 1.4±0.7 on the left eye (median decrease of -1 points, 95% CI from -2.0 to -1.0) (p< 0.001 for both sides). The TFBUT increased significantly after one-month treatment (right eye median increase of 1.1 sec, 95% CI from 0.2 to 1.0 sec; left eye median increase of 0.9 sec, 95% CI from 0.3 to 1.5 sec)(p=0.02 right eye; p=0.004 left eye). The mean Oxford Scheme grade staining decreased significantly during the entire period of the examination (right eye median decrease of -1.0 grade, 95% CI from -1.0 to -1.0 grade; left eye median decrease of -1.0 grade, 95% CI from -1.0 to -1.0 grade after three months)(p<0.001 both sides). The subjective complaints of the patients measured with the OSDI questionnaire showed a significant improvement after 3 months’ treatment (median decrease of -13.1 scores, 95% CI from -25.0 to -8.3 scores)(p<0.001). During the study period, two patients complained of a greasy sensation on their eyelids, but they did not stop the treatment. No other adverse reactions were reported.
 
Based on the results of this trial, the Hungarian health authorities approved the amendment of the LO2A labeling to include the treatment of DES patients suffering from CCH, and patents were filed in the United States, Israel and Japan for the use of the active component of the drug for treating CCH.
 
A further Phase II study was performed at Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary in 2016. This study explored the safety and efficacy of LO2A in patients with moderate severity dry eye associated with Sjögren’s where the ocular surface showed Lissamine Green staining causing marked subjective symptoms using the OSDI questionnaire. Twenty-one patients applied LO2A eye drops to both eyes in a single arm, open label study. Patients applied 4 drops a day to each eye for 3 months. LIPCOF score, Lissamine Green staining, tear production and OSDI questionnaire were measured. The study demonstrated a reduction in the LIPCOF score, a decrease in Lissamine Green staining according to the Oxford scale and mitigation of subjective symptoms of dry eye according to the OSDI questionnaire. However, there was no change in tear production during the study.
 
We are evaluating such information and are considering the potential consequences on our business. In addition, we plan to use the clinical results and approval received in the Netherlands the treatment of Sjögren’s to assist our Company in the registration of LO2A as a treatment for Sjögren’s in the Licensed Territories.
 
Our Clinical Trials
 
We have finished a Multi-Center Trial at five different centers in Israel that commenced in August 2016. The Multi-Center Trial is a Phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study carried out in parallel groups that is evaluating the safety and efficacy of LO2A for patients suffering from moderate to severe CCH. The trial completed enrollment of all 62 patients on March 26, 2018, with the treatment time for each patient being 3 months. The primary efficacy endpoint for this study is the change from baseline in lissamine green conjunctival staining score at 3 months; secondary endpoints include change from baseline in lissamine green conjunctival staining score at 1 month, change from baseline in LIPCOF score at 1 and 3 months, change from baseline in TFBUT at 1 and 3 months and change from baseline in OSDI questionnaire score at 1 and 3 months. Safety endpoints include adverse events recorded throughout the trial, best-corrected visual acuity, slit lamp biomicroscopy findings, undilated fundoscopy findings and intraocular pressure measurements. We consulted with ophthalmology consultants from the United States in the preparation of the protocol for the Multi-Center Trial.

It is envisioned that the clinical study required for approval in Israel will be of a similar design to the Multi-Center Trial, but appropriately powered to demonstrate clinical significance according to the treatment effect observed in the current study. We will consult with the Israel Ministry of Health before a registration study to confirm acceptability of the efficacy endpoints.
 
The comprehensive cost of the Multi-Center Trial is estimated at $850,000. As of November 14, 2018, the Multi-Center Trial had completed treatment of all of the planned 62 patients, with the treatment time for each patient being three months. In November 2018 we received the top line results for the Multi-Center trial which describe analysis of the primary endpoint, defined as the reduction in Lissamine green conjunctival staining (LGCS) score from baseline to 3 months. The originally planned primary analysis was based upon recruitment of a sample size of 62 patients. Analysis was performed on the 49 fully evaluable patients using a mixed model with repeated measures (MMRM) and utilized all post baseline observations, (1-month and 3-month follow-ups) demonstrating statistical significance between the LO2A group and the placebo group (P=0.0079). The planned primary endpoint analysis compared average reduction in LGCS score from baseline to three months. This analysis also demonstrated a strong trend towards significance (P=0.0713) with average reduction in LGCS score between baseline and 3 months of -3.5 and -1.6 in the LO2A and placebo groups, respectively. We expect the full statistical report to be published as soon as the statistical results and conclusion are available and approved.
 
On October 26, 2017, Wize Israel announced the termination of its Single Center Trial. The Single Center Trial was a Phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot study carried out in parallel groups that was intended to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LO2A for patients suffering from moderate to severe CCH, with Wize Israel having sole access to the trial data. On October 24, 2017, Wize Israel received notice from the contract research organization that manages and supervises Wize Israel’s clinical trials, that an inadequate amount of quality information may be derived from the results collected thus far, given that there is no correlation in the reaction of both eyes to LO2A, in contrast to professional literature and other trials. In addition, the recruitment rate of patients was less than required and there was a higher than expected dropout rate. In light of the above, the CRO concluded that the results of the trial would be of no use even if the trial continued until the end of its term. Based on the CRO’s conclusion, Wize Israel determined to terminate the trial and to save the future costs that would be incurred in connection with such trial.
 
In February 2018, we received Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval for the protocol of our planned Phase IV Study, which is a randomized, double-masked, study of LO2A versus Alcon’s Systane® Ultra UD, an over-the-counter lubricant eye drop product used to relieve dry and irritated eyes. The Phase IV Study will take place in Israel and will evaluate the safety and efficacy of LO2A for symptomatic improvement of DES in 60 adult patients with Sjögren’s. Enrolled patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment groups, LO2A or Systane® Ultra UD. Drops will be administered topically to the eye over a three month period. The primary efficacy endpoint for this study is change from baseline in corneal and conjunctival staining score at 3 months. Secondary efficacy endpoints include change from baseline in corneal and conjunctival staining score at 1 month, change from baseline in eye dryness score (visual analogue scale) at 1 and 3 months and change from baseline in OSDI questionnaire score at 1 and 3 months. Safety will be evaluated by collection of adverse event data throughout the study, best-corrected visual acuity and slit lamp biomicroscopy findings.
 
This Phase IV Study is designed to support our clinical approval pathway for LO2A for the treatment of DES in patients with Sjögren’s within certain markets including the U.S., China and Israel. We enrolled our first patient in the Phase IV Study in the end of March 2018. Data obtained from this study will be submitted to the Israel Ministry of Health and will be included in the clinical data package submitted during interactions with the FDA. The study is considered necessary as the existing clinical data in this indication is considered of insufficient quality for submission to the regulatory agencies mentioned above.
 
Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 were approximately $694,000, for the year ended December 31, 2017 were approximately $450,000.

Raw Materials and Suppliers
 
We believe that the raw materials that would be required to manufacture LO2A are widely available from numerous suppliers and are generally considered to be generic industrial chemical supplies.
Manufacturing
 
There can be no assurance that LO2A can be manufactured in sufficient commercial quantities, in compliance with regulatory requirements and at an acceptable cost. We and our contract manufacturers are, and will be, subject to extensive governmental regulation in connection with LO2A. We and our manufacturer must ensure that all of the processes, methods and equipment are compliant with both cGMP, and current Good Laboratory Practices for drugs on an ongoing basis, as mandated by the applicable regulatory authorities, and conduct extensive audits of vendors, contract laboratories and suppliers. We have entered into agreements with a manufacturer in Germany relating to the manufacturing of LO2A. We have completed the production of LO2A for purposes of our ongoing Phase II clinical trial and expect to begin production for commercial use only after obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals in Israel to market LO2A and receive orders from the distributors (for more information, see “—Marketing, Sales and Distribution” below).
Marketing, Sales and Distribution 
 
We plan to engage local or multinational distributors to handle the distribution of LO2A. In particular, we intend to enter into agreements with pharmaceutical companies with relevant marketing capabilities in the field of pharmaceuticals in order to have them distribute and sell LO2A in the Licensed Territories. To date, we have entered into exclusive distribution agreements in Israel to market LO2A for the treatment of DES, and in Ukraine for the treatment of DES. The registration process in certain countries, including the United States, requires us to undertake additional clinical trials, in addition to the Phase II and Phase IV clinical trials that we are currently conducting. In August, 2015, LO2A received the approval of the Israel Ministry of Health for use in Israel as a medical preparation for the treatment of DES, under the brand name “Eyecon®”. In July 2017, we received our first order from the distributor in Israel, for an immaterial amount.
 
On November 3, 2017, Wize Israel entered into a framework agreement with the Chinese Distributor, whereby, subject to the negotiation and execution of a detailed distribution agreement and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals in China, the Chinese Distributor will act as exclusive distributor in China of LO2A. The framework agreement includes, among other things, minimum purchase obligations of the Chinese Distributor, which Wize Israel estimated to range, over the five-year period of the contemplated agreement, between $22.5 million to $39 million. The Chinese Distributor plans to import LO2A from one of the existing European countries, most likely Hungary, and thus the indications shall include DES and any additional indication already approved in the specific European country. If such indications are imported from Hungary, the indications would include DES, CCH and Sjögren’s. Clinical trials in China may be required by the China Food and Drug Administration (“CFDA”) as part of the regulatory requirements for approving LO2A in China. At this stage it is not certain whether such clinical trials will be required.
 
On May 31, 2018, we entered into an Exclusive Distribution Agreement with the Chinese Distributor (the “Chinese Distribution Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Chinese Distribution Agreement, Wize Israel has granted to the Chinese Distributor the exclusive right to sell and distribute LO2A Lacrycon® formula products (manufactured by Pharma Stulln GmbH) in the mainland of China (excluding Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan) subject to certain terms and conditions. Pursuant to the Chinese Distribution Agreement, the the Chinese Distributor will be responsible for all necessary regulatory approvals, registration procedures, licenses, permits and authorizations required for the marketing, importation, sale and service of LO2A in China. Wize Israel will assist the the Chinese Distributor in completing clinical trials, if such needed. Pursuant to the Chinese Distribution Agreement, the Chinese Distributor has the option of designating certain affiliates, dealers, distributors, medical institutions and other parties (the “Designated Entities), however the Chinese Distributor will remain fully liable for the activities or omissions of any such Designated Entities. Wize Israel is required, among others, to (i) utilize best efforts to obtain certain approvals with respect to Sjögren’s, DES and CCH, (ii) obtain a valid patent registration for the Uni-dose Products and the Multi-dose Products with respect to certain indications and (iii) obtain certain marketing approvals in Hungary, among other things. The Chinese Distribution Agreement includes certain product pricing terms and minimum binding order quantities. The Chinese Distribution Agreement has an initial term of 5 years and, thereafter, automatically renews for additional terms of 5 years each, subject to full compliance with the terms of the Chinese Distribution Agreement.

We intend to engage pharmaceutical companies or distributors around the world with relevant marketing capabilities in the pharmaceutical field, in order for such pharmaceutical companies to sell LO2A, with us prioritizing those countries where we may expedite the registration process of LO2A based on existing knowledge and studies previously conducted on LO2A, without requiring additional studies. In this respect, we have been studying the possibility of marketing LO2A for DES treatment only in the United States, but have not made any determinations regarding the best route that can be used to obtain FDA approval to market LO2A. Currently, we intend to approach the FDA as part of our preliminary request procedure (Pre-IND) and discuss possible alternatives for approving LO2A for treating DES in the United States. However, as this FDA process is both time consuming and costly, we do not intend to approach the FDA on a Pre-IND basis until we are able to secure additional funding.
 
Competition
 
The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly evolving technology, intense competition and a highly risky, costly and lengthy research and development process. Adequate protection of intellectual property, successful product development, adequate funding and retention of skilled, experienced and professional personnel are among the many factors critical to success in the pharmaceutical industry. We operate in markets featuring competition between competing manufacturers in the field of DES treatment, while, to our knowledge, no therapy is currently approved specifically for Sjögren’s or CCH.
 
The global DES market features three particularly dominant companies, which are responsible for an estimated 82% of all revenues: Novartis/Alcon (through its Celluvisc®, Hyalein®, Vismed® and Systane® drugs); Allergan (Restasis®, Refresh®) and Santen. In July 2016, the FDA approved an additional medicine, Xiidra®, produced by Shire Plc, for the treatment of DES, and sales began in August 2016.
 
To date, no therapeutic agent has received approval specifically for Sjögren’s. Drugs that are used for the symptomatic relief of ocular signs and symptoms associated with Sjögren’s include cholinergic agonists e.g. Salagen (pilocarpine) and Evoxac (cevilemine) and the immunomodulatory agent Restasis (cyclosporine). Systemic Immunomodulary treatments, usually for extra-glandular disease, which may be used include hydroxychloroquine (mild inflammatory symptoms of joints, muscles and skin), corticosteroids (rare but serious symptoms: vasculitic rash, interstitial lung disease, interstitial nephritis, glomerulonephritis), immunosuppressive agents e.g. methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide (used to treat serious internal organ manifestations) and biologic agents e.g. rituximab. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressants lead to broad, non-selective immunosuppression often associated with significant adverse events.
 
The pipeline of drugs in development for the indication of Sjögren’s is relatively small with only one product in Phase III, Orencia, being developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb. There are a number of drugs in Phase I or II stages of development including AMG/MEDI5872 developed by Amgen, BIIB063 developed by Biogen, CFZ533 and VAY736 developed by Novartis, GSK618960 developed by GSK, LY3090106 developed by Eli Lilly, MEDI4920 developed by MedImmune, RG7625 developed by Roche, RSLV developed by Resolve Therapeutics and Actemra developed by the University Hospital of Strasbourg. In addition, there is an ongoing Phase II combination study combining Benlysta and Rituxan.
 
We believe that LO2A has a number of advantages over competing products in the DES and Sjögren’s markets, including LO2A lacking preservatives, its ability to be used with any contact lenses, its anti-irritant properties and its non-Newtonian viscosity profile. On the other hand, other drugs on the market, including new drugs under development, may all be competitive to LO2A. In fact, some of these drugs are well established and accepted among patients and physicians in their respective markets, can be efficiently produced and marketed, and are relatively safe. Moreover, other companies of various sizes engage in activities similar to ours. Most, if not all, of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources available to them. Competitors include companies with marketed products and/or an advanced research and development pipeline.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our success depends in part on our ability (directly or through Resdevco) to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for LO2A and its underlying technology and know-how, and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing such proprietary rights.
 
19

 

The LO2A composition and use thereof for treating or alleviating DES was covered by US Patent No. 5,106,615, which has expired. Accordingly, we are currently focusing our marketing and commercial efforts with respect to CCH and Sjögren’s rather than DES, as more fully described elsewhere in this report. The use of LO2A for treating or alleviating CCH under US Patent No. 8,912,166 has been granted to us under the LO2A License Agreement.
 
The use of LO2A for treating or alleviating CCH is protected by the patent family of International Patent Application Publ. No. WO2012150583, filed on April 5, 2012, assigned to Resdevco, entitled EYE DROPS FOR TREATMENT OF CONJUNCTIVOCHALASIS. Corresponding members include US Patent No. 8,912,166, Israeli Patent No. 212725, Japanese Patent No. 5957517 and pending European Pat. Appl. 2704747. Granted patents and patents to issue of this patent family will expire, without extension, in 2032.
 
The use of LO2A for treating or alleviating irritation of the eye caused non-infectious diseases, such as Sjögren’s, is covered by Provisional Patent Application No. 62/467139, filed on March 5, 2017, assigned to Resdevco, entitled EYE DROPS FOR TREATMENT OF IRRITATION NOT DUE TO INFECTION. Patents to issue based on this provisional application will expire, without extension, in 2038.
 
Pursuant to the LO2A License Agreement, Resdevco has contractually agreed to be responsible for the payment of all relevant fees associated with the maintenance of its intellectual property rights. The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies, such as Resdevco and us, are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Resdevco’s ability to maintain and solidify its proprietary position for LO2A will depend on its success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. There is no certainty that any of Resdevco’s pending patent applications or those pending patent applications that it licenses will result in the issuance of any patents or that we will obtain rights to any further patents or patent applications. Any issued patents and those that may issue in the future may be challenged, narrowed, circumvented or found to be invalid or unenforceable, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or the length of term of patent protection that we may have for LO2A under the LO2A License Agreement. We cannot be certain that Resdevco was the first to invent the inventions claimed in its owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications. In addition, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by Resdevco, and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide Resdevco or us with any meaningful competitive advantages against these competitors. Please see under “RISK FACTORS – Risks Related to our Intellectual Property,” beginning on page 45 of this report.
 
Environmental Matters
 
We and our manufacturers, distributors and other service providers are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing air emissions, water and wastewater discharges, noise emissions, the use, management and disposal of hazardous, radioactive and biological materials and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites. We believe that our business, including those of our service providers, are being operated in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. Based on information currently available to us, we do not expect environmental costs and contingencies to have a material adverse effect on our business. However, significant expenditures may be imposed on those third party service providers should they be required to comply with new or more stringent environmental or health and safety laws, regulations or requirements, which may in turn adversely affect us.
Government Regulations
 
We operate in a highly controlled regulatory environment. Stringent regulations establish requirements relating to analytical, toxicological and clinical standards and protocols in respect of the testing of pharmaceuticals. Regulations also cover research, development, manufacturing and reporting procedures, both pre- and post-approval. In many markets, especially in Europe, marketing and pricing strategies are subject to national legislation or administrative practices that include requirements to demonstrate not only the quality, safety and efficacy of a new product, but also its cost-effectiveness relating to other treatment options. Failure to comply with regulations can result in stringent sanctions, including product recalls, withdrawal of approvals, seizure of products and criminal prosecution.
 
20

 

Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of LO2A or any of our future product candidates, we must demonstrate through clinical trials that any of our product candidates are safe and effective. Historically, the results from preclinical studies and early clinical trials often have not accurately predicted results of later clinical trials. In addition, a number of pharmaceutical products have shown promising results in clinical trials but subsequently failed to establish sufficient safety and efficacy results to obtain necessary regulatory approvals. We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial expense for, and devote a significant amount of time to, clinical trials. Many factors can delay the commencement and rate of completion of clinical trials, including the inability to recruit patients at the expected rate, the inability to follow patients adequately after treatment, the failure to manufacture sufficient quantities of materials used for clinical trials, and the emergence of unforeseen safety issues and governmental and regulatory delays. If a product candidate fails to demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical trials, this failure may delay development of other product candidates and hinder our ability to conduct related clinical trials. Additionally, as a result of these failures, we may also be unable to obtain additional financing.
 
Governmental authorities in all major markets require that a new pharmaceutical product be approved before it is marketed, and have established high standards for technical appraisal, which can result in an expensive and lengthy approval process. The time to obtain approval varies by country and some products are never approved. The lengthy process of conducting clinical trials, seeking approval and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, if approval is obtained, are very costly and require the expenditure of substantial resources.
 
A summary of the regulatory processes in countries where we are seeking or will seek regulatory approval follow below.
 
United States
 
In the United States, the Public Health Services Act and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the quality, safety and effectiveness standards for any of our product candidates and the raw materials and components used in the production of, testing, manufacture, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our products on a product-by-product basis.
 
Before the clinical studies, the FDA requires from the applicants to complete extensive preclinical laboratory tests, drug chemistry, animal (in vivo), formulation, stability and other studies.
 
Certain preclinical tests must be conducted in compliance with good laboratory practice (GLP) regulations. Non-compliance with GLP standard can, in some cases, lead to invalidation of the studies, requiring them to be replicated. After laboratory analysis and preclinical testing, a sponsor files an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application, with the FDA to begin human testing.
 
The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND may result in the FDA not allowing the clinical trials to commence or not allowing the clinical trials to commence on the terms originally specified in the IND. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during drug development, and the FDA must grant permission, either explicitly or implicitly by not objecting, before each clinical trial can begin.
 
Typically, a manufacturer conducts a three-phase human clinical testing program which itself is subject to numerous laws and regulatory requirements, including adequate monitoring, reporting, record keeping and informed consent.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be used. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An independent institutional review board (“IRB”), for each medical center proposing to conduct a clinical trial must also review and approve a plan for any clinical trial before it can begin at that center and the IRB must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”), requirements, including the requirements for informed consent.
 
21

 

All clinical research performed in the United States in support of a new drug application (“NDA”) must be authorized in advance by the FDA under the IND regulations and procedures described above. However, a sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to FDA in support of an NDA so long as the clinical trial is conducted in compliance with an international guideline for the ethical conduct of clinical research known as the Declaration of Helsinki and/or the laws and regulations of the country or countries in which the clinical trial is performed, whichever provides the greater protection to the participants in the clinical trial.
 
In Phase I, small clinical trials are conducted to determine the safety and proper dose ranges of any of our product candidates. In Phase II, clinical trials are conducted to assess safety and gain preliminary evidence of the efficacy of any of our product candidates. In Phase III, clinical trials are conducted to provide sufficient data for the statistically valid evidence of safety and efficacy and these studies include a large number of participants. The time and expense required for us to perform this clinical testing can vary and is substantial. We cannot be certain that we will successfully complete Phase I, Phase II or Phase III testing of any of our product candidates within any specific time period, if at all. Furthermore, the FDA, the IRB responsible for approving and monitoring the clinical trials at a given site, the Data Safety Monitoring Board, where one is used, or we may suspend the clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that subjects or patients are exposed to unacceptable health risk.
 
If the clinical data from these clinical trials (Phases I, II and III) is deemed to support the safety and effectiveness of the candidate product for its intended use, then we may proceed to seek to file with the FDA an NDA seeking approval to market a new drug for one or more specified intended uses. We cannot ascertain whether the clinical data will support and justify filing an NDA. Nevertheless, if and when we are able to ascertain that the clinical data supports and justifies filing an NDA, we intend to make such appropriate filings.
 
The purpose of an NDA is to provide the FDA with sufficient information so that it can assess whether it ought to approve the candidate product for marketing for specific intended uses. The NDA normally contains, among other things, sections describing the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls, non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology, human pharmacokinetics and bioavailability, microbiology, the results of the clinical trials, and the proposed labeling which contains, among other things, the intended uses of the candidate product.
 
We cannot take any action to market any new drug or biologic product in the United States until our appropriate marketing application has been approved by the FDA. The FDA has substantial discretion over the approval process and may disagree with our interpretation of the data submitted. The process may be significantly extended by requests for additional information or clarification regarding information already provided. As part of this review, the FDA may refer the application to an appropriate advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians. Satisfaction of these and other regulatory requirements typically takes several years, and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product. Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of potential products for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures on our activities. We cannot be certain that the FDA or other regulatory agencies will approve any of our products on a timely basis, if at all. Success in early stage clinical trials does not assure success in later-stage clinical trials. Even if a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific indications or uses and these limitations may adversely affect the commercial viability of the product. Delays in obtaining, or failures to obtain regulatory approvals, would have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
We may also seek approval under programs designed to accelerate the FDA’s review and approval of NDAs. For instance, a sponsor may seek FDA designation of a drug candidate as a “fast track product.” Fast track products are those products intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. If fast track designation is obtained, the FDA may initiate review of sections of an NDA before the application is complete. This “rolling review” is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for submission to the FDA of the remaining information. In some cases, a fast track product may be approved on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Approvals of this kind, referred to as accelerated approvals, typically include requirements for appropriate post-approval Phase IV clinical trials to validate the surrogate endpoint or otherwise confirm the effect of the clinical endpoint.

In addition, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, which was enacted and signed into law in 2012, established a new category of drugs referred to as “breakthrough therapies” that may be subject to accelerated approval. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a drug candidate as a “breakthrough therapy” if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drug candidates may also be eligible for “priority review,” or review within a six-month timeframe from the date a complete NDA is accepted for filing, if a sponsor shows that its drug candidate provides a significant improvement compared to marketed drugs. Fast track designation, accelerated approval, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. When appropriate, we intend to seek fast track designation, accelerated approval, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review, as applicable for our drug candidates. We cannot predict whether any of our drug candidates will obtain such designations or approvals, or the ultimate impact, if any, of such designations or approvals on the timing or likelihood of FDA approval of any of its proposed drugs.
 
Even after we obtain FDA approval, we may be required to conduct further clinical trials (i.e., Phase IV trials) and provide additional data on safety and effectiveness. We are also required to gain separate approval for the use of an approved product as a treatment for indications other than those initially approved. Before approving an application, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the finished drug product, and sometimes the active drug ingredient, is manufactured, and will not approve the drug unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. The FDA may also inspect the sites at which the clinical trials were conducted to assess their compliance, and will not approve the drug unless compliance with GCP requirements is satisfactory.
 
If, as a result of these inspections, the FDA determines that our facilities do not comply with applicable FDA regulations and conditions of product approval, the FDA may seek civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against us including the suspension of our manufacturing operations.
 
Drugs may be marketed only for the FDA approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials.
 
We have currently received no approvals to market our products from the FDA or other foreign regulators, besides Israel and the countries where LO2A is already marketed by Resdevco.
 
Post-Marketing Requirements
 
Following approval of a new product, a pharmaceutical company generally must engage in numerous specific monitoring and recordkeeping activities and continue to submit periodic and other reports to the applicable regulatory agencies, including any cases of adverse events and appropriate quality control records. Modifications or enhancements to the products or labeling or changes of site of manufacture are often subject to the approval of the FDA and other regulators, which may or may not be received or may result in a lengthy review process.
  
Prescription drug advertising is subject to federal, state and foreign regulations. In the United States, the FDA regulates prescription drug promotion, including direct-to-consumer advertising. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Any distribution of prescription drug products and pharmaceutical samples must comply with the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act, a part of the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
 
In the United States, once a product is approved, its manufacture is subject to comprehensive and continuing regulation by the FDA. The FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, and NDA holders must list their products and register their manufacturing establishments with the FDA. These regulations also impose certain organizational, procedural and documentation requirements with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities. NDA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms, and, in certain circumstances, qualified suppliers to these firms. These firms and, where applicable, their suppliers are subject to inspections by the FDA at any time, and the discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMPs, could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such facilities or the ability to distribute products manufactured, processed or tested by them.
 
23

 

Healthcare Laws and Regulations
 
We are also subject to various federal, state and international laws pertaining to health care “fraud and abuse,” including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. The federal Anti-kickback law, which governs federal healthcare programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid), makes it illegal to solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. Many states have similar laws that are not restricted to federal healthcare programs. Federal and state false claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid), claims for reimbursement, including claims for the sale of drugs or services, that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services.
 
If the government or other relevant party were to allege that we violated these laws there could be a material adverse effect on our stock price. Even an unsuccessful challenge could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. A finding of liability under these laws can have significant adverse financial implications for us and can result in payment of large penalties and possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs. We will consult counsel concerning the potential application of these and other laws to our business and our sales, marketing and other activities and will make good faith efforts to comply with them. However, given their broad reach and the increasing attention given by law enforcement authorities, we cannot assure you that some of our activities will not be challenged or deemed to violate some of these laws.
 
European Economic Area
 
We do not currently have license or right to distribute in countries in the European Union (“EU”). Although we are not currently seeking regulatory approval in the European Union (“EU”), we may do so in the future. As such, a summary of the EU regulatory processes follows below.
 
A medicinal product may only be placed on the market in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”), composed of the 28 EU member states, plus Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein, when a marketing authorization has been issued by the competent authority of a member state pursuant to Directive 2001/83/EC (as recently amended by Directive 2004/27/EC), or an authorization has been granted under the centralized procedure in accordance with Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004 or its predecessor, Regulation 2309/93. There are essentially three community procedures created under prevailing European pharmaceutical legislation that, if successfully completed, allow an applicant to place a medicinal product on the market in the EEA.
  
Centralized Procedure
 
Regulation 726/2004/EC now governs the centralized procedure when a marketing authorization is granted by the European Commission, acting in its capacity as the European Licensing Authority on the advice of the EMA. That authorization is valid throughout the entire community and directly or (as to Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) indirectly allows the applicant to place the product on the market in all member states of the EEA. The EMA is the administrative body responsible for coordinating the existing scientific resources available in the member states for evaluation, supervision and pharmacovigilance of medicinal products. Certain medicinal products, as described in the Annex to Regulation 726/2004, must be authorized centrally. These are products that are developed by means of a biotechnological process in accordance with Paragraph 1 to the Annex to the Regulation. Medicinal products for human use containing a new active substance for which the therapeutic indication is the treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorder or diabetes must also be authorized centrally. Starting on May 20, 2008, the mandatory centralized procedure was extended to autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. Finally, all medicinal products that are designated as orphan medicinal products pursuant to Regulation 141/2000 must be authorized under the centralized procedure. An applicant may also opt for assessment through the centralized procedure if it can show that the medicinal product constitutes a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or that the granting of authorization centrally is in the interests of patients at the community level. For each application submitted to the EMA for scientific assessment, the EMA is required to ensure that the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”), is given within 210 days after receipt of a valid application. This 210 days period does not include the time that the applicant to answer any questions raised during the application procedure, the so-called ‘clock stop’ period. If the opinion is positive, the EMA is required to send the opinion to the European Commission, which is responsible for preparing the draft decision granting a marketing authorization. This draft decision may differ from the CHMP opinion, stating reasons for diverging for the CHMP opinion. The draft decision is sent to the applicant and the member states, after which the European Commission takes a final decision. If the initial opinion of the CHMP is negative, the applicant is afforded an opportunity to seek a re-examination of the opinion. The CHMP is required to re-examine its opinion within 60 days following receipt of the request by the applicant. All CHMP refusals and the reasons for refusal are made public on the EMA website. Without a centralized marketing authorization it is prohibited to place a medicinal product that must be authorized centrally on the market in the EU.
 
24

 

National Procedure
 
This procedure is available for medicinal products that do not fall within the scope of mandatory centralized authorization and are intended for use in only one EU member state. Specific procedures and timelines differ between member states, but the duration of the procedure is generally 210 days and based on a risk/efficacy assessment by the competent authority of the member state concerned, followed by determination of Summary of Product Characteristics (“SmPC”) package leaflet and label text/layout and subsequently grant of the marketing authorization. Marketing authorizations granted on this basis are not mutually recognized by other member states.
 
The majority of medicines available in the EU were authorized at national level, either because they were authorized before EMA’s creation or they were not in the scope of the centralized procedure. Each EU Member State has its own national authorization procedures. If a company wishes to request marketing authorization in several EU Member States for a medicine that is outside the scope of the centralized procedure, it may use one of the following routes:
 

● | the mutual-recognition procedure, whereby a marketing authorization granted in one Member State can be recognized in other EU countries; or 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the decentralized procedure, whereby a medicine that has not yet been authorized in the EU can be simultaneously authorized in several EU Member States. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mutual Recognition and Decentralized Procedures
 
With the exception of products that are authorized centrally, the competent authorities of the member states are responsible for granting marketing authorizations for medicinal products placed on their national markets. If the applicant for a marketing authorization intends to market the same medicinal product in more than one member state, the applicant may seek an authorization progressively in the community under the mutual recognition or decentralized procedure. Mutual recognition is used if the medicinal product has already been authorized in a member state. In this case, the holder of this marketing authorization requests the member state where the authorization has been granted to act as reference member state by preparing an updated assessment report that is then used to facilitate mutual recognition of the existing authorization in the other member states in which approval is sought (the so-called concerned member state(s)). The reference member state must prepare an updated assessment report within 90 days of receipt of a valid application. This report together with the approved SmPC (which sets out the conditions of use of the product), and a labeling and package leaflet are sent to the concerned member states for their consideration. The concerned member states are required to approve the assessment report, the SmPC and the labeling and package leaflet within 90 days of receipt of these documents. The total procedural time is 180 days.
 
The decentralized procedure is used in cases where the medicinal product has not received a marketing authorization in the EU at the time of application. The applicant requests a member state of its choice to act as reference member state to prepare an assessment report that is then used to facilitate agreement with the concerned member states and the grant of a national marketing authorization in all of these member states. In this procedure, the reference member state must prepare, for consideration by the concerned member states, the draft assessment report, a draft SmPC and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. As in the case of mutual recognition, the concerned member states are required to approve these documents within 90 days of their receipt.
 
For both mutual recognition and decentralized procedures, if a concerned member state objects to the grant of a marketing authorization on the grounds of a potential serious risk to public health, it may raise a reasoned objection with the reference member state. The points of disagreement are in the first instance referred to the Co-ordination Group on Mutual Recognition and Decentralized Procedures (“CMD”), to reach an agreement within 60 days of the communication of the points of disagreement. If member states fail to reach an agreement, then the matter is referred to the EMA and CHMP for arbitration. The CHMP is required to deliver a reasoned opinion within 60 days of the date on which the matter is referred. The scientific opinion adopted by the CHMP forms the basis for a binding European Commission decision.
 
Irrespective of whether the medicinal product is assessed centrally, de-centrally or through a process of mutual recognition, the medicinal product must be manufactured in accordance with the principles of good manufacturing practice as set out in Directive 2003/94/EC and Volume 4 of the rules governing medicinal products in the European community. Moreover, community law requires the clinical results in support of clinical safety and efficacy based upon clinical trials conducted in the European community to be in compliance with the requirements of Directive 2001/20/EC, which implements good clinical practice in the conduct of clinical trials on medicinal products for human use. Clinical trials conducted outside the European community and used to support applications for marketing within the EU must have been conducted in a way consistent with the principles set out in Directive 2001/20/EC. The conduct of a clinical trial in the EU requires, pursuant to Directive 2001/20/EC, authorization by the relevant national competent authority where a trial takes place, and an ethics committee to have issued a favorable opinion in relation to the arrangements for the trial. It also requires that the sponsor of the trial, or a person authorized to act on his behalf in relation to the trial, be established in the community.
 
25

 

There are various types of applications for marketing authorizations:
 
Full Applications
 
A full application is one that is made under any of the community procedures described above and “stands alone” in the sense that it contains all of the particulars and information required by Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83 (as amended) to allow the competent authority to assess the quality, safety and efficacy of the product and in particular the balance between benefit and risk. Article 8(3)(l) in particular refers to the need to present the results of the applicant’s research on (i) pharmaceutical (physical-chemical, biological or microbiological) tests, (ii) preclinical (toxicological and pharmacological) studies and (iii) clinical trials in humans. The nature of these tests, studies and trials is explained in more detail in Annex I to Directive 2001/83/EC. Full applications would be required for products containing new active substances not previously approved by the competent authority, but may also be made for other products.
Abridged Applications
 
Article 10 of Directive 2001/83/EC contains exemptions from the requirement that the applicant provide the results of its own preclinical and clinical research. There are three regulatory routes for an applicant to seek an exemption from providing such results, namely (i) cross-referral to an innovator’s results without consent of the innovator, (ii) well established use according to published literature and (iii) consent to refer to an existing dossier of research results filed by a previous applicant.
Cross-referral to Innovator’s Data
 
Articles 10(1) and 10(2)(b) of Directive 2001/83/EC provide the legal basis for an applicant to seek a marketing authorization on the basis that its product is a generic medicinal product (a copy) of a reference medicinal product that has already been authorized, in accordance with community provisions. A reference product is, in principle, an original product granted an authorization on the basis of a full dossier of particulars and information. This is the main exemption used by generic manufacturers for obtaining a marketing authorization for a copy product. The generic applicant is not required to provide the results of preclinical studies and of clinical trials if its product meets the definition of a generic medicinal product and the applicable regulatory results protection period for the results submitted by the innovator has expired. A generic medicinal product is defined as a medicinal product:

● | having the same qualitative and quantitative composition in active substance as the reference medicinal product; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | having the same pharmaceutical form as the reference medicinal product; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | whose bioequivalence with the reference medicinal product has been demonstrated by appropriate bioavailability studies. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Applications in respect of a generic medicinal product cannot be made before the expiry of the protection period. Where the reference product was granted a national marketing authorization pursuant to an application made before October 30, 2005, the protection period is either six years or 10 years, depending upon the election of the particular member state concerned. Where the reference product was granted a marketing authorization centrally, pursuant to an application made before November 20, 2005, the protection period is 10 years. For applications made after these dates, Regulation 726/2004 and amendments to Directive 2001/83/EC provide for a harmonized protection period regardless of the approval route utilized. The harmonized protection period is in total 10 years, including eight years of research data protection and two years of marketing protection. The effect is that the originator’s results can be the subject of a cross-referral application after eight years, but any resulting authorization cannot be exploited for a further two years. The rationale of this procedure is not that the competent authority does not have before it relevant tests and trials upon which to assess the efficacy and safety of the generic product, but that the relevant particulars can, if the research data protection period has expired, be found on the originator’s file and used for assessment of the generic medicinal product. The 10-year protection period can be extended to 11 years where, in the first eight years post-authorization, the holder of the authorization obtains approval for a new indication assessed as offering a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing products.
 
26

 

If the copy product does not meet the definition of a generic medicinal product or if certain types of changes occur in the active substance(s) or in the therapeutic indications, strength, pharmaceutical form or route of administration in relation to the reference medicinal product, Article 10(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC provides that the results of the appropriate preclinical studies or clinical trials must be provided by the applicant.
 
Well-established Medicinal Use
 
Under Article 10a of Directive 2001/83/EC, an applicant may, in substitution for the results of its own preclinical and clinical research, present detailed references to published literature demonstrating that the active substance(s) of a product have a well-established medicinal use within the community with recognized efficacy and an acceptable level of safety. The applicant is entitled to refer to a variety of different types of literature, including reports of clinical trials with the same active substance(s) and epidemiological studies that indicate that the constituent or constituents of the product have an acceptable safety/efficacy profile for a particular indication. However, use of the published literature exemption is restricted by stating that in no circumstances will constituents be treated as having a well-established use if they have been used for less than 10 years from the first systematic and documented use of the substance as a medicinal product in the EU. Even after 10 years’ systematic use, the threshold for well-established medicinal use might not be met. European pharmaceutical law requires the competent authorities to consider among other factors the period over which a substance has been used, the amount of patient use of the substance, the degree of scientific interest in the use of the substance (as reflected in the scientific literature) and the coherence (consistency) of all the scientific assessments made in the literature. For this reason, different substances may reach the threshold for well-established use after different periods, but the minimum period is 10 years. If the applicant seeks approval of an entirely new therapeutic use compared with that to which the published literature refers, additional preclinical and/or clinical results would have to be provided.
 
Consent to refer to an existing dossier info
 
Under Article 10c of Directive 2001/83/EC, following the grant of a marketing authorization the holder of such authorization may consent to a competent authority utilizing the pharmaceutical, preclinical and clinical documentation that it submitted to obtain approval for a medicinal product to assess a subsequent application relating to a medicinal product possessing the same qualitative and quantitative composition with respect to the active substances and the same pharmaceutical form.
 
Law Relating to Pediatric Research
 
Regulation (EC) 1901/2006 (as amended by Regulation (EC) 1902/2006) was adopted on December 12, 2006. This Regulation governs the development of medicinal products for human use in order to meet the specific therapeutic needs of the pediatric population. It requires any application for marketing authorization made after July 26, 2008 in respect of a product not authorized in the European Community on January 26, 2007 (the time the Regulation entered into force), to include the results of all studies performed and details of all information collected in compliance with a pediatric investigation plan agreed by the Pediatric Committee of the EMA, unless the product is subject to an agreed waiver or deferral or unless the product is excluded from the scope of Regulation 1902/2006 (generics, hybrid medicinal products, biosimilars, homeopathic and traditional (herbal) medicinal products and medicinal products containing one or more active substances of well-established medicinal use). Waivers can be granted in certain circumstances where pediatric studies are not required or desirable. Deferrals can be granted in certain circumstances where the initiation or completion of pediatric studies should be deferred until appropriate studies in adults have been performed. Moreover, this regulation imposes the same obligation from January 26, 2009 on an applicant seeking approval of a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a product already authorized and still protected by a supplementary protection certificate granted under Regulation EC 469/2009 and its precursor (EEC) 1768/92 or by a patent that qualifies for the granting of such a supplementary protection certificate. The pediatric Regulation 1901/2006 also provides, subject to certain conditions, a reward for performing such pediatric studies, regardless of whether the pediatric results provided resulted in the grant of a pediatric indication. This reward comes in the form of an extension of six months to the supplementary protection certificate granted in respect of the product, unless the product is subject to orphan drug designation, in which case the 10-year market exclusivity period for such orphan products is extended to 12 years. If any of the non-centralized procedures for marketing authorization have been used, the six-month extension of the supplementary protection certificate is only granted if the medicinal product is authorized in all member states.
 
27

 

Post-authorization Obligations
 
In the pre-authorization phase the applicant must provide a detailed pharmacovigilance plan that it intends to implement post-authorization. An authorization to market a medicinal product in the EU carries with it an obligation to comply with many post-authorization organizational and behavioral regulations relating to the marketing and other activities of authorization holders. These include requirements relating to post-authorization efficacy studies, post-authorization safety studies, adverse event reporting and other pharmacovigilance requirements, advertising, packaging and labeling, patient package leaflets, distribution and wholesale dealing. The regulations frequently operate within a criminal law framework and failure to comply with the requirements may not only affect the authorization, but also can lead to financial and other sanctions levied on the company in question and responsible officers.
 
As a result of the currently on-going overhaul of EU pharmacovigilance legislation the financial and organizational burden on market authorization holders will increase significantly, such as the obligation to maintain a pharmacovigilance system master file that applies to all holders of marketing authorizations granted in accordance with Directive 2001/83/EC or Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. Marketing authorization holders must furthermore collect data on adverse events associated with use of the authorized product outside the scope of the authorization. Pharmacovigilance for biological products and medicines with a new active substance will be strengthened by subjecting their authorization to additional monitoring activities. The EU is currently in the process of issuing implementing regulations for the new pharmacovigilance framework.
 
Any authorization granted by member state authorities, which within three years of its granting is not followed by the actual placing on the market of the authorized product in the authorizing member state ceases to be valid. When an authorized product previously placed on the market in the authorizing member state is no longer actually present on the market for a period of three consecutive years, the authorization for that product shall cease to be valid. The same two three year periods apply to authorizations granted by the European Commission based on the centralized procedure.
 
Israel
 
In addition to regulations of other countries where we are seeking or will seek regulatory approval, Israeli government regulations will also govern the development of our product candidates.
Clinical Testing in Israel
 
In order to conduct clinical testing on humans in Israel, special authorization must first be obtained from the ethics committee and general manager of the institution in which the clinical studies are scheduled to be conducted, as required under the Guidelines for Clinical Trials in Human Subjects implemented pursuant to the Israeli Public Health Regulations (Clinical Trials in Human Subjects), as amended from time to time, and other applicable legislation. These regulations also require authorization from the Israel Ministry of Health, except in certain circumstances, and in the case of genetic trials, special fertility trials and similar trials, an additional authorization of the overseeing institutional ethics committee. The institutional ethics committee must, among other things, evaluate the anticipated benefits that are likely to be derived from the project to determine if it justifies the risks and inconvenience to be inflicted on the human subjects, and the committee must ensure that adequate protection exists for the rights and safety of the participants as well as the accuracy of the information gathered in the course of the clinical testing. Since we intend to perform a portion of the clinical studies on certain of our therapeutic candidates in Israel, we will be required to obtain authorization from the ethics committee and general manager of each institution in which we intend to conduct our clinical trials, and in most cases, from the Israel Ministry of Health.
Israel Ministry of Health
 
Israel’s Ministry of Health, which regulates medical testing, has adopted protocols that correspond, generally, to those of the FDA and the EMA, making it comparatively straightforward for studies conducted in Israel to satisfy FDA and the EMA requirements, thereby enabling medical technologies subjected to clinical trials in Israel to reach U.S. and EU commercial markets in an expedited fashion. Many members of Israel’s medical community have earned international prestige in their chosen fields of expertise and routinely collaborate, teach and lecture at leading medical centers throughout the world. Israel also has free trade agreements with the United States and the European Union.

China
 
Historically the regulatory environment for the medicinal products in China has been considered a challenging one, due to:
 

● | discrepancies between national and international quality standards; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | timeframes for review and approval of new drugs that is longer than in most major countries; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a lack of capacity of the regulatory bodies that has resulted in a backlog of applications. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In August 2015, the China State Council issued “Opinions on Reforming the Review and Approval System for Drugs and Medical Devices.” The overarching intention of this initiative was to promote transformation and upgrade of the pharmaceutical industry and bring marketed products up to international standards in terms of efficacy, safety and quality, so as to better meet the public needs for drugs. For future NDAs, the CFDA requires applicants to include a clinical trial self-inspection report, which the CFDA will further review.
 
Review Process
 
In February 2016, the CFDA initiated a priority review procedure, pursuant to which the following medicinal product categories will be eligible for the priority review status:
 

● | Innovative drugs not approved anywhere worldwide;
--+--------------------------------------------------


● | Innovative drugs where there is a plan to transfer the manufacturing site to China; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Global clinical trial application (“CTA”) to China in parallel with the US or EU; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Innovative drugs for HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis, rare disease(s), malignant tumors and pediatric indications; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Newly launched generic drugs.
--+------------------------------

 
After the CFDA approves the priority review process request, applicants are given priority reviewer resources allocated by the Center for Drug Evaluation (“CDE”) and additional channels to communicate with and obtain quick feedback from the CDE/CFDA. Target approval time from submission is within six months.
 
China started to implement a pilot program MAH System in ten provinces in 2015. The MAH system will be implemented throughout China and the Drug Administration Law of China will be amended accordingly. Under such program, a research and development organization or its personnel can be an MAH. The MAH will be fully responsible for any liability with respect to the drug during the lifecycle. The parties authorized by the MAH to conduct relevant work, including research and production, will bear liability in accordance with the law and the applicable agreements. In addition, the MAH will also be required to establish a system to directly report adverse drug reactions or adverse drug events.
 
29

 

CFDA has also created a new classification “new to the world”, to replace the previous “new to China” category. This is based on the global marketing authorization approval status and the location of the manufacturing sites inside or outside of China. This removes the previous definitions that were based on the specific status in China and aligns classification more closely to other regulatory agencies.
 
On October 10, 2017, the CFDA issued the Decision to Adjust Relevant Items concerning Imported Drug Registration (the “Imported Drug Decision”). The Imported Drug Decision implemented changes to facilitate the review and approval process for imported drugs, particularly for innovative imported drugs. Pursuant to the Imported Drug Decision, the CFDA will accept foreign clinical trial data as part of international multi-center clinical trials. In addition, the Imported Drug Decision provides that an overseas applicant intending to conduct an international multi-center clinical trial in China can simultaneously conduct a Phase I clinical trial inside and outside China, which essentially means foreign Phase I clinical trial data can be used for the approval application of imported drugs.
 
The Submission Policy
 
Previously, the CFDA required that a foreign-developed drug must be approved in another country, and then proceed to China for NDA/MAA submission. Even if there is multinational clinical trial (“MNCT”) data in China, the applicant had to wait for the Certificates of Pharmaceutical Product (“CPP”) from the US, EU or other countries, and only then could there be a second submission (submission to the CFDA to request clinical trial waiver).
 
Under the new policy, there is no need for the CPP. After completing the MNCT with the necessary relevant clinical study report (CSR), a sponsor can make an NDA/MAA submission to the CFDA without CPP. This means, theoretically, that the China NDA/MAA submission and approval can be in parallel with (or even precede) the foreign MAA approval. These changes more closely align China to global standards, processes and timelines and should have a substantial impact on the China local pharmaceutical market and on the global pharmaceutical industry.
 
This new policy is expected to have a strong positive impact on foreign-developed new drug innovators who can have a full clinical development program inside China, with significantly shortened regulatory review processes. The CFDA marketing authorization approval can be in parallel with the US, EU or any other country’s approval.
 
During 2017, the CFDA announced the following policies which may also positively impact the product registration process in China:
 

● | Policy on reform of clinical trial management. The CFDA will no longer accredit clinical sites with GCP. This opens clinical sites to all qualified hospitals, meaning a likely increase in the number of sites able to manage clinical trials in order to meet the need of increase of drug and medical device trials in China. The CFDA retains responsibility for site inspections. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Policy on acceleration of drug and medical device registration review process. For medicinal products indicated for serious life-threatening conditions or for significant unmet medical needs, where early or mid-stage clinical data can predict clinical benefits, the CFDA will be able to grant a conditional approval to allow early marketing in China, with a defined risk management plan and commitment to complete required clinical trial(s) based on the CFDA’s review and conclusion. China’s Ministry of Health will issue a rare disease list for China and set up a rare disease patient registration process. The orphan drug and medical device manufacturer/applicant can apply for a clinical trial waiver or an agreed decrease in trial subject numbers. For orphan drugs or medical devices that are already approved outside of China, the CFDA can issue a conditional approval to allow marketing in China, while the sponsor completes commitment for clinical trial based on the CFDA’s review and conclusion.

In general, positive changes for China’s regulatory environment are expected to better align China with global regulatory norms by achieving the following:
 

● | Shortening the new IND and NDA review timeline. This may reverse the previous reluctance to include China in global studies or programs because of the long IND timelines. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increasing transparency and globalization. The CFDA is encouraging foreign sponsors to undertake global studies in China and recommending that local clinical sites join global studies to help ensure clinical trial data meet the requirements needed for China and global registration. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Minimizing the drug lag. The change in the foreign drug registration process by eliminating the CPP requirement may allow the drug approval process in China to be in parallel with the US and/or the EU.

Other Countries
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, the EU, Israel and China, we may be subject to a variety of other regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of drugs in other countries. Whether or not our products receive approval from the FDA or EMA approval of such products must be obtained by the comparable regulatory authorities of countries other than the United States or European Union before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA or EMA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and product licensing vary greatly from country to country.
 
The requirements that we and our collaborators must satisfy to obtain regulatory approval by government agencies in other countries prior to commercialization of our products in such countries can be rigorous, costly and uncertain. In the European countries, Canada and Australia, regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar in principle to those in the United States. Additionally, depending on the type of drug for which approval is sought, there are currently two potential tracks for marketing approval in the European countries: mutual recognition and the centralized procedure. These review mechanisms may ultimately lead to approval in all European Union countries, but each method grants all participating countries some decision-making authority in product approval. Foreign governments also have stringent post-approval requirements including those relating to manufacture, labeling, reporting, record keeping and marketing. Failure to substantially comply with these on-going requirements could lead to government action against the product, us and/or our representatives.
 
Related Matters
 
From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in governmental bodies that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA or EMA and other applicable regulatory bodies to which we are subject. In addition, regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the national agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our therapeutic candidates. It is impossible to predict whether such legislative changes will be enacted, whether FDA or EMA regulations, guidance or interpretations will change, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. We may need to adapt our business and therapeutic candidates and products to changes that occur in the future.
Seasonality
 
Our business and operations are generally not affected by seasonal fluctuations or factors.

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
 
We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:

● | a requirement to provide only two years of audited financial statements in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements with correspondingly reduced “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” disclosure; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | reduced disclosure about executive compensation arrangements; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | no non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of internal control over financial reporting. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We may take advantage of these provisions for up to five years or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company on the date that is the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we had total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our initial public offering; (iii) the date on which we had issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC.
 
To the extent that we continue to qualify as a “smaller reporting company,” as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, after we cease to qualify as an emerging growth company, certain of the exemptions available to us as an emerging growth company may continue to be available to us as a smaller reporting company, including: (1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act; (2) scaled executive compensation disclosures; and (3) the requirement to provide only two years of audited financial statements, instead of three years.
 
Employees
 
We currently have one full time employee, Or Eisenberg, our Acting Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and one part time employee. In addition, we engage certain outside consultants that are, in general, compensated on an hourly basis, with compensation taking the form of both cash and share-based payment.
