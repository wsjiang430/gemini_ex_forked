Our industry-based, consultative approach helps customers envision, build and run more innovative and efficient businesses. Our services include digital services and solutions, consulting, application development, systems integration, application testing, application maintenance, infrastructure services and business process services. Digital services are becoming an increasingly important part of our portfolio of services and solutions and are often integrated or delivered along with our other services. We tailor our services and solutions to specific industries and use an integrated global delivery model that employs customer service teams based at customer locations and delivery teams located at customer locations and dedicated global and regional delivery centers.
Business Segments
We go to market across our four industry-based business segments. Our customers seek to partner with service providers that have a deep understanding of their businesses, industry initiatives, clients, markets and cultures and the ability to create solutions tailored to meet their individual business needs. We believe that our deep knowledge of the industries we serve and our clients’ businesses has been central to our revenue growth and high customer satisfaction. Our business segments are as follows:

• Banking• Insurance | • Healthcare• Life Sciences | • Retail and Consumer Goods• Manufacturing and Logistics • Travel and Hospitality • Energy and Utilities | • Communications and Media• Technology

Our Financial Services segment includes banking, capital markets and insurance companies.

Our Healthcare segment consists of healthcare providers and payers as well as life sciences companies, including pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device companies.

 Our Products and Resources segment includes manufacturers, retailers, travel and hospitality companies, as well as companies providing logistics, energy and utility services. Demand in this segment is driven by our customers’ focus on improving the efficiency of their operations, the enablement and integration of mobile platforms to support sales and other omni channel commerce initiatives, and their adoption and integration of digital technologies, such as the application of intelligent systems to manage supply chain and enhance overall customer experiences.

See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to disaggregation of revenues by customer location, service line and contract-type for each of our business segments. 
Services and Solutions
Our services include digital services and solutions, consulting, application development, systems integration, application testing, application maintenance, infrastructure services and business process services. Additionally, we develop, license, implement and support proprietary and third-party software products and platforms for the healthcare industry. Digital services and solutions, such as analytics and artificial intelligence, digital engineering, intelligent process automation, interactive and hybrid cloud, are becoming an increasingly important part of our portfolio of services and solutions. In many cases, our customers' new digital systems are built upon the backbone of their existing legacy systems. Also, customers often look for efficiencies in the way they run their operations so they can fund investments in new digital capabilities. We believe our deep knowledge of their infrastructure and systems provides us with a significant advantage as we work with them to build new digital capabilities and apply digital technologies to make their operations more efficient. We deliver all our services and solutions across our four industry-based business segments to best address our customers individual needs.
We seek to drive organic growth through investments in our digital capabilities, including the extensive training and re-skilling of our technical teams and the expansion of our local workforces in the United States and other markets around the world where we operate. Additionally, we pursue select strategic acquisitions, joint ventures, investments and alliances that can expand our digital capabilities or the geographic or industry coverage of our business. In 2018, we completed five such acquisitions: Bolder Healthcare Solutions, a provider of revenue cycle management solutions to the healthcare industry in the United States; Hedera Consulting, a business advisory and data analytics service provider in Belgium and the Netherlands; Softvision, a digital engineering and consulting company with significant operations in Romania and India that focuses on agile development of custom cloud-based software and platforms for customers primarily in the United States; ATG, a United States based consulting company that helps companies plan, implement, and optimize automated cloud-based quote-to-cash business processes and technologies; and SaaSfocus, a Salesforce services provider in Australia.
We have organized our services and solutions into three practice areas: Digital Business, Digital Operations, and Digital Systems and Technology. These practice areas are supported by Cognizant Consulting, our Global Technology Office and Cognizant Accelerator.

Cognizant Digital Business 
Our digital business practice helps customers rethink their business models, working with customers to reinvent existing businesses and create new ones by innovating products, services, and experiences. Areas of focus within this practice area are digital strategy, artificial intelligence and analytics, connected products, interactive user experiences and digital engineering that builds next-generation applications and experiences at speed and scale. These services are often delivered along with our application development, systems integration and digital services. 
Cognizant Digital Operations
Our digital operations practice helps customers rethink their operating models and modernize their business operations by re-engineering and managing their most essential business processes resulting in lower operating costs, better employee and customer outcomes and improved top-line growth. Areas of focus within this practice area are intelligent process automation, industry and platform solutions and enterprise services. We have extensive knowledge of core front office, middle office and back office processes, including finance and accounting, procurement, data management, and research and analytics, which we integrate with our industry and technology expertise to deliver targeted business process services and solutions. Our highly specialized domain expertise is important in creating industry-aligned solutions for our customers' needs in areas such as clinical data management, pharmacovigilance, equity research support, commercial operations and order management.
Cognizant Digital Systems & Technology
Our digital systems and technology practice helps customers reshape their technology models to simplify, modernize and secure the enabling systems that form the backbone of their business. Areas of focus within this practice area include system integration services, infrastructure services (including cloud), quality engineering and assurance, and security and application services. Our application services include traditional development, testing and maintenance and agile development of new software and applications that transform existing businesses at speed and scale.
Cognizant Consulting, Global Technology Office, and Cognizant Accelerator
Supporting our three practice areas, the Cognizant Consulting team provides global business, process, operations and technology consulting services to our customers. Our consulting professionals and domain experts from our industry-focused business segments work closely with our practice areas to create frameworks, platforms and solutions that customers find valuable as they pursue new efficiencies and look to leverage digital technologies across their operations. Our Global Technology Office and Cognizant Accelerator focus on utilizing new technologies to develop innovative and practical offerings for customers' emerging needs and support our business segments and practice areas. 
Global Delivery Model
We utilize a global delivery model, with delivery centers worldwide, to provide the full range of services we offer to our customers. Our global delivery model includes four distinct delivery methods, with most customer engagements utilizing several or all of these delivery methods. Our global delivery model includes employees located in the following locations: customers’ sites, local or in-country delivery centers, regional delivery centers and offshore delivery centers. As we scale our digital services and solutions, we are focused on hiring in the United States and other countries to expand our in-country delivery capabilities. Our extensive facilities, technology and communications infrastructure are designed to enable the effective collaboration of our global workforce across locations and geographies.
Sales and Marketing
We market and sell our services directly through our professional staff, senior management and direct sales personnel operating out of our global headquarters and business development offices, which are strategically located around the world. The sales and marketing group works with our customer delivery team as the sales process moves closer to a customer’s selection of a services provider. The duration of the sales process may vary widely depending on the type and complexity of services.

Customers
The services we provide are distributed among a number of customers in each of our business segments. A loss of a significant customer or a few significant customers in a particular segment could materially reduce revenues for that segment. However, the services we provide to our larger customers are often critical to their operations and a termination of our services would typically require an extended transition period with gradually declining revenues. The volume of work performed for specific customers is likely to vary from year to year, and a significant customer in one year may not use our services in a subsequent year. Revenues from our top customers as a percentage of total revenues were as follows:

 | For the years ended December 31,
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Top five customers | 8.6 | % | | 8.9 | % | 10.0 | %
Top ten customers | 15.4 | % | | 14.9 | % | 16.7 | %

Competition
The markets for our services are highly competitive, characterized by a large number of participants and subject to rapid change. Competitors may include systems integration firms, contract programming companies, application software companies, cloud computing service providers, traditional consulting firms, professional services groups of computer equipment companies, infrastructure management and outsourcing companies and boutique digital companies. Our direct competitors include, among others, Accenture, Atos, Capgemini, Deloitte Digital, DXC Technology, EPAM Systems, Genpact, HCL Technologies, IBM Global Services, Infosys Technologies, Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro. In addition, we compete with numerous smaller local companies in the various geographic markets in which we operate.
The principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our services include the provider’s reputation and experience, vision and strategic advisory ability, digital services capabilities, performance and reliability, responsiveness to customer needs, financial stability, corporate governance and competitive pricing of services. Accordingly, we rely on the following to compete effectively:

• | investments to scale our digital services;


• | our recruiting, training and retention model;


• | our global service delivery model;


• | an entrepreneurial culture and approach to our work;


• | a broad customer referral base;


• | investment in process improvement and knowledge capture;


• | financial stability and good corporate governance;


• | continued focus on responsiveness to customer needs, quality of services and competitive prices; and


• | project management capabilities and technical expertise.

Intellectual Property
We provide value to our customers based, in part, on our proprietary innovations, methodologies, reusable knowledge capital and other intellectual property ("IP") assets. We recognize the importance of IP and its ability to differentiate us from our competitors. We seek IP protection for some of our innovations and rely on a combination of IP laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our IP and our brand. We have registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, domain names and copyrights. We own or are licensed under a number of patents, trademarks, copyrights, and licenses, which vary in duration, relating to our products and services. While our proprietary IP rights are important to our success, we believe our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular IP right, or any particular group of patents, trademarks, copyrights or licenses.
Employees
We had approximately 281,600 employees at the end of 2018, with approximately 50,000 in North America, approximately 18,300 in Europe and approximately 213,300 in various other locations throughout the rest of the world, including approximately 194,700 in India.
