 ﻿
 EVANS BANCORP, INC.
 ﻿
 Evans Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”) is a New York business corporation which is registered as a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHCA”).  The principal office of the Company is located at One Grimsby Drive, Hamburg, NY 14075 and its telephone number is (716) 926-2000.  This facility is occupied by the Office of the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, as well as the Administrative and Loan Divisions of Evans Bank.  The Company was incorporated on October 28, 1988, but the continuity of its banking business is traced to the organization of the Evans National Bank of Angola on January 20, 1920.  Except as the context otherwise requires, the Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries are collectively referred to in this report as the “Company.”  The Company’s common stock is traded on the NYSE American, LLC under the symbol “EVBN.”
 ﻿
 At December 31, 2018, the Company had consolidated total assets of $1.4 billion, deposits of $1.2 billion and stockholders’ equity of $132 million.
 ﻿
 The Company’s primary business is the operation of its subsidiaries.  It does not engage in any other substantial business activities.  The Company has two direct wholly-owned subsidiaries: (1) Evans Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”), which provides a full range of banking services to consumer and commercial customers in Western New York; and (2) Evans National Financial Services, LLC (“ENFS”), which owns 100% of the membership interests in The Evans Agency, LLC (“TEA”), which sells various premium-based insurance policies on a commission basis.  At December 31, 2018, the Bank represented 99% and ENFS represented 1% of the consolidated assets of the Company.  Further discussion of our segments is included in Note 19 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 ﻿
 Evans Bank, N.A.

 MARKET AREA
 ﻿
 The Company’s primary market area is Erie County, Niagara County, northern Chautauqua County and northwestern Cattaraugus County, NY.  This primary market area is the area where the Bank principally receives deposits and makes loans and TEA sells insurance.
 ﻿
 MARKET RISK
 ﻿
 For information about, and a discussion of, the Company's "Market Risk," see Part II, Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Market Risk" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 ﻿
 COMPETITION
 ﻿
 All phases of the Company’s business are highly competitive.  The Company competes actively with local, regional and national financial institutions, as well as with bank branches and insurance agency offices in the Company’s primary market area of Erie County, Niagara County, northern Chautauqua County, and northwestern Cattaraugus County, NY.  These Western New York counties have a high density of financial institutions, many of which are significantly larger and have greater financial resources than the Company.  The Company faces competition for loans and deposits from other commercial banks, savings banks, internet banks, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking companies, credit unions, and other financial services companies.  The Company faces additional competition from non-depository competitors such as the mutual fund industry, securities and brokerage firms, and insurance companies and brokerages.   In the personal insurance area, the majority of TEA’s competition comes from direct writers, as well as some small local agencies located in the same towns and villages in which TEA has offices.  In the commercial business segment, the majority of the competition comes from larger agencies located in and around Buffalo, NY.  By offering the large number of carriers which it has available to its customers, TEA has attempted to remain competitive in all aspects of its business.
 ﻿
 As an approximate indication of the Company’s competitive position, the Bank had the sixth most deposits in the Buffalo, NY metropolitan statistical area according to the FDIC’s annual deposit market share report as of June 30, 2018 with 3% of the total market’s deposits of $43 billion.  By comparison, the market leaders, M&T Bank and Key Bank, had 79% of the Buffalo, NY metropolitan statistical area deposits combined.  The Company attempts to be generally competitive with all financial institutions in its service area with respect to interest rates paid on time and savings deposits, service charges on deposit accounts, and interest rates charged on loans.

 ﻿
 SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
 ﻿
 Bank holding companies and banks are extensively regulated under both federal and state laws and regulations that are intended to protect depositors and customers.  Additionally, because the Company is a public company with shares traded on the NYSE American, it is subject to regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as the listing standards required by NYSE American.  To the extent that the following summary describes statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions.  Any change in the applicable law or regulation, or a change in the way such laws or regulations are interpreted by regulatory agencies or courts, may have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.
 ﻿
 Bank Holding Company Regulation (BHCA)
 ﻿
 As a financial holding company registered under the BHCA, the Company and its non-banking subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision under the BHCA by the FRB.  The FRB requires periodic reports from the Company, and is authorized by the BHCA to make regular examinations of the Company and its subsidiaries.  
 ﻿
 The Company is required to obtain the prior approval of the FRB before merging with or acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of, or direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of, a bank or bank holding company.  The FRB will not approve any acquisition, merger or consolidation that would have a substantial anti-competitive result, unless the anti-competitive effects of the proposed transaction are outweighed by a greater public interest in meeting the needs and convenience of the public.
 ﻿
 Subject to various exceptions, the BHCA and the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, together with related regulations, require FRB approval before any person or company acquires “control” of a bank holding company.  Control is conclusively presumed to exist if an individual or company acquires 25% or more of any class of voting securities of the bank holding company.  Rebuttable control is presumed to exist if a person or company acquires 10% or more, but less than 25%, of any class of the bank holding company’s voting securities.
 ﻿
 The FRB also considers managerial, capital and other financial factors in acting on acquisition or merger applications.  A bank holding company may not engage in, or acquire direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company engaged in any non-banking activity, unless such activity has been determined by the FRB to be closely related to banking or managing banks.  The FRB has identified by regulation various non-banking activities in which a bank holding company may engage with notice to, or prior approval by, the FRB.
 ﻿
 The FRB has enforcement powers over financial holding companies and their subsidiaries, among other things, to enjoin activities that represent unsafe or unsound practices or constitute violations of law, rule, regulation, administrative orders, or written agreements with a federal bank regulator.  These powers may be exercised through the issuance of cease and desist orders, civil monetary penalties or other actions.
 ﻿
 Under Regulation Y, a bank holding company must serve as a source of financial and managerial strength for its subsidiary banks and must not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner.  Additionally, Regulation Y requires a bank holding company to give the FRB prior notice of any redemption or repurchase of its own equity securities, if the consideration to be paid, together with the consideration paid for any repurchases in the preceding year, is equal to 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth.  The FRB may oppose the transaction if it believes that the transaction would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law or regulation.  There is an exception for bank holding companies that are well-managed, well capitalized, and not subject to any unresolved supervisory issues.  To date, the Company has qualified for this exception.  As another example, a bank holding company may not impair its subsidiary bank’s soundness by causing it to make funds available to non-banking subsidiaries or their customers if the FRB believed it would not be prudent to do so.
 ﻿
 Bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks are also subject to the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”).  Under the terms of the CRA, the FRB (or other appropriate bank regulatory agency, in the case of the Bank, the OCC) is required, in connection with its examination of a bank, to assess such bank’s record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by that bank, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods.  Furthermore, such assessment is taken into account in evaluating any application made by a bank holding company or a bank for, among other things, approval of a branch or other deposit facility, office relocation, a merger or an acquisition of bank shares.

 ﻿
 Supervision and Regulation of Bank Subsidiaries
 ﻿
 The Bank is a nationally chartered banking corporation subject to supervision, examination and regulation by the FRB, the FDIC and the OCC.  These regulators have the power to enjoin “unsafe or unsound practices,” require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, direct an increase in capital, restrict the growth of a bank, assess civil monetary penalties, and remove a bank’s officers and directors.
 ﻿
 The operations of the Bank are subject to numerous statutes and regulations.  Such statutes and regulations relate to required reserves against deposits, investments, loans, mergers and consolidations, issuance of securities, payment of dividends, establishment of branches, and other aspects of the Bank’s operations.  Various consumer laws and regulations also affect the operations of the Bank, including state usury laws, laws relating to fiduciaries, consumer credit and equal credit, fair credit reporting, and privacy of non-public financial information.
 ﻿
 The Bank is subject to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W thereunder, which govern certain transactions, such as loans, extensions of credit, investments and purchases of assets between member banks and their affiliates, including their parent holding companies.  These restrictions limit the transfer from its subsidiaries, including the Bank, of funds to the Company in the form of loans, extensions of credit, investments or purchases of assets (collectively, “Transfers”), and they require that the Bank’s transactions with the Company be on terms no less favorable to the Bank than comparable transactions between the Bank and unrelated third parties.  Transfers by the Bank to any affiliate (including the Company) are limited in amount to 10% of the Bank’s capital and surplus, and transfers to all affiliates are limited in the aggregate to 20% of the Bank’s capital and surplus.  Furthermore, such loans and extensions of credit are also subject to various collateral requirements.  These regulations and restrictions may limit the Company’s ability to obtain funds from the Bank for its cash needs, including funds for acquisitions, and the payment of dividends, interest and operating expenses.
 ﻿
 The Bank is prohibited from engaging in certain tying arrangements in connection with any extension of credit, lease or sale of property or furnishing of services.  For example, the Bank may not generally require a customer to obtain other services from the Bank or the Company, and may not require the customer to promise not to obtain other services from a competitor as a condition to an extension of credit.  The Bank is also subject to certain restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, principal stockholders or any related interest of such persons.  Extensions of credit: (i) must be made on substantially the same terms (including interest rates and collateral) as those prevailing at the time for, and following credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than those applicable to, comparable transactions with persons not covered above and who are not employees, and (ii) must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features.  The Bank is also subject to certain lending limits and restrictions on overdrafts to such persons.  A violation of these restrictions may result in the assessment of substantial civil monetary penalties on the Bank or any officer, director, employee, agent or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of the Bank or the imposition of a cease and desist order.
 ﻿
 As insurer, the FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by, insured institutions.  It may also prohibit an insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the FDIC.  The FDIC also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against insured institutions.  The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution, including the Bank, if it determines after a hearing that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order or any condition imposed by an agreement with the FDIC.
 ﻿
 The FDIC has adopted a risk-based premium system that provides for quarterly assessments based on an insured institution’s ranking in one of four risk categories based on their examination ratings and capital ratios.  In addition, all FDIC-insured institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation (“FICO”), a mixed-ownership Federal government corporation established to recapitalize the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation.  The current annualized FICO assessment rate is 0.14 basis points, or approximately 0.04 basis points per quarter.  These assessments will continue until the interest payments are fully funded for the Financing Corporation bonds, which mature in September 2019.  Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”), the deposit insurance assessment base was redefined in 2011 to reflect average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity.  The result is that larger financial institutions, which have more assets leveraged with non-deposit wholesale funds, generally have paid a greater percentage of the aggregate insurance assessment and smaller banks, including the Bank, have paid less.

 ﻿
 Regulations promulgated by the FDIC pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 place limitations on the ability of certain insured depository institutions to accept, renew or rollover deposits by offering rates of interest which are significantly higher than the prevailing rates of interest on deposits offered by other depository institutions having the same type of charter in such depository institutions’ normal market area.  Under these regulations, well-capitalized institutions may accept, renew or rollover such deposits without restriction, while adequately capitalized institutions may accept, renew or rollover such deposits with a waiver from the FDIC (subject to certain restrictions on payment of rates).  Undercapitalized institutions may not accept, renew or rollover such deposits.
 ﻿
 Under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, a depository institution insured by the FDIC can be held liable for any loss incurred by, or reasonably expected to be incurred by, the FDIC in connection with: (i) the default of a commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institution, or (ii) any assistance provided by the FDIC to a commonly controlled FDIC-insured institution in danger of default.  “Default” is defined generally as the appointment of a conservator or receiver, and “in danger of default” is defined generally as the existence of certain conditions indicating that, in the opinion of the appropriate banking agency, a “default” is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance.
 ﻿
 In addition to the foregoing, federal regulators have adopted regulations and examination procedures promoting the safety and soundness of institutions by specifically addressing, among other things: (i) internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems; (ii) loan documentation; (iii) credit underwriting; (iv) interest rate exposure; (v) asset growth; (vi) ratio of classified assets to capital; (vii) minimum earnings; and (viii) compensation and benefits standards for management officials.  FRB regulations, for example, generally require a bank holding company to give the FRB prior notice of any redemption or repurchase of the bank holding company’s equity securities, if the consideration to be paid, together with the consideration paid for any repurchases or redemptions in the preceding year, is equal to 10% or more of the company's consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board has broad authority to prohibit activities of bank holding companies and their non-banking subsidiaries which represent unsafe and unsound banking practices or which constitute violations of laws or regulations, and can assess civil money penalties for certain activities conducted on a knowing and reckless basis, if those activities caused a substantial loss to a depository institution.
 ﻿
 Dividends paid by the Bank have been the Company's primary source of operating funds and are expected to be for the foreseeable future. Capital adequacy requirements serve to limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the Bank.  Under OCC regulations, the Bank may not pay a dividend, without prior OCC approval, if the total amount of all dividends declared during the calendar year, including the proposed dividend, exceed the sum of its retained net income to date during the calendar year and its retained net income over the preceding two years.  As of December 31, 2018, approximately $22 million was available for the payment of dividends without prior OCC approval.  The Bank’s ability to pay dividends is also subject to the Bank being in compliance with regulatory capital requirements.  At December 31, 2018, the Bank was in compliance with these requirements.
 ﻿
 Because the Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank, the Company's right to participate in the distribution of assets of the Bank in the event of the Bank's liquidation or reorganization would be subject to the prior claims of the Bank's creditors. In the event of a liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors and other general or subordinated creditors are entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including a parent bank holding company (such as the Company) or any shareholder or creditor thereof.
 ﻿
 The FRB, the OCC and other federal banking agencies have broad enforcement powers, including the power to terminate deposit insurance, to impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties, and to appoint a conservator or receiver for the assets of a regulated entity.  Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and supervisory agreements could subject the Company or its subsidiaries, as well as officers, directors and other institution-affiliated parties of these organizations, to administrative sanctions and potential civil monetary penalties.
 ﻿
 Capital Adequacy
 ﻿
 The Company and its subsidiary bank are required to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards established by the federal banking agencies.  In July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC, and the FDIC approved final rules (the “Capital Rules”) establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations.  These rules went into effect as to the Company and the Bank on January 1, 2015, subject to phase-in periods for certain components and other provisions.
 ﻿
 Basel III and the Capital Rules.  The Capital Rules generally implemented the Basel Committee’s December 2010 final capital framework referred to as “Basel III” for strengthening international capital standards.  The Capital Rules substantially revised the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries, including Evans Bancorp, Inc., and Evans Bank N.A., as compared to the U.S. general risk-based capital rules that were applicable to the Company through December 31, 2014.  The Capital Rules revised the definitions and the components of regulatory capital, and addressed other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios. The Capital Rules also addressed asset risk weights and other matters affecting the denominator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios.


 
9

 
﻿
 Among other matters, the Capital Rules: (i) introduce a new capital measure called “Common Equity Tier 1” (“CET1”) and related regulatory capital ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets; (ii) specified that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and “Additional Tier 1 capital” instruments meeting certain revised requirements; (iii) mandated that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital; and (iv) expanded the scope of the deductions from and adjustments to capital as compared to the previous regulations.
 ﻿
 Pursuant to the Capital Rules, the minimum capital ratios as of January 1, 2015 (subject to the phase-in of additional requirements as described below) were as follows:

﻿ | 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ | 
 | 4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets; 
﻿ | 
 | 6.0% Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets; 
﻿ | 
 | 8.0% Total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets; and 
﻿ | 
 | 4.0% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on the consolidated financial statements (known as the “leverage ratio”).

  ﻿
 The Capital Rules also introduced a new “capital conservation buffer,” composed entirely of CET1, on top of the minimum risk-weighted asset ratios described above, which was designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress.  Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer face constraints on dividends, equity and other capital instrument repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall.  The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at 0.625% and increased by 0.625% on each subsequent January 1 until it was fully phased-in on January 1, 2019.  The capital standards applicable to the Company, as fully phased-in include an additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of CET1, effectively resulting in minimum ratios inclusive of the capital conservation buffer of (i) CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5%; (iii) Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5% and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets.
 ﻿
 The Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1.  These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such items, in the aggregate, exceed 15% of CET1.
 ﻿
 In addition, the Capital Rules include certain exemptions to address concerns about the regulatory burden on community banks.  For example, banking organizations with less than $15 billion in consolidated assets as of December 31, 2009 are permitted to include in Tier 1 capital trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock issued and included in Tier 1 capital prior to May 19, 2010 on a permanent basis, without any phase out (subject to a limit of 25% of Tier 1 capital).  Also, community banks were able to elect on a one time basis in their March 31, 2015 quarterly filings to opt-out of the onerous requirement to include most accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) components in the calculation of common equity Tier 1 capital and, in effect, retain the AOCI treatment under the current capital rules.  Under the Capital Rules, the Company made a one-time, permanent election to continue to exclude AOCI from capital.

 ﻿
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the “FDIA”) establishes a system of regulatory remedies to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions, referred to as the prompt corrective action.  The federal banking regulators have established five capital categories (“well-capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized”) and must take certain mandatory supervisory actions, and are authorized to take other discretionary actions, with respect to institutions which are undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized.  The severity of these mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed.  Generally, subject to a narrow exception, the FDIA requires the banking regulator to appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized.  The FDIC has specified by regulation the relevant capital levels for each category, which are printed below. The Federal Reserve Board and the OCC have specified the same or similar levels for each category.

﻿ | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ | 
“Well-Capitalized” | “Adequately Capitalized” 
CET1 ratio of 6.5% Leverage Ratio of 5%, Tier 1 Capital ratio of 8%, Total Capital ratio of 10%, and Not subject to a written agreement, order, capital directive or regulatory remedy directive requiring a specific capital level. | CET1 ratio of 4.5% Leverage Ratio of 4%, Tier 1 Capital ratio of 6%, and Total Capital ratio of 8%. 
﻿ 
“Undercapitalized” | “Significantly Undercapitalized” 
CET1 Ratio of less than 4.5% Leverage Ratio less than 4%, Tier 1 Capital ratio less than 6%, or Total Capital ratio less than 8%. | CET1 Ratio of less than 3% Leverage Ratio less than 3%, Tier 1 Capital ratio less than 4%, or Total Capital ratio less than 6%. 
﻿ 
“Critically undercapitalized” | 
Tangible equity to total assets less than 2%. | 

  ﻿
 For purposes of these regulations, the term “tangible equity” includes core capital elements counted as Tier 1 Capital for purposes of the risk-based capital standards plus the amount of outstanding cumulative perpetual preferred stock (including related surplus), minus all intangible assets with certain exceptions.
 ﻿
 An institution that is classified as well-capitalized based on its capital levels may be classified as adequately capitalized, and an institution that is adequately capitalized or undercapitalized based upon its capital levels may be treated as though it were undercapitalized or significantly undercapitalized, respectively, if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment.
 ﻿
 An institution that is categorized as undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking regulator.  Under the FDIA, in order for the capital restoration plan to be accepted by the appropriate federal banking agency, a BHC must guarantee that a subsidiary depository institution will comply with its capital restoration plan, subject to certain limitations.  The BHC must also provide appropriate assurances of performance.  The obligation of a controlling BHC under the FDIA to fund a capital restoration plan is limited to the lesser of 5.0% of an undercapitalized subsidiary’s assets or the amount required to meet regulatory capital requirements.  An undercapitalized institution is also generally prohibited from increasing its average total assets, making acquisitions, establishing any branches or engaging in any new line of business, except in accordance with an accepted capital restoration plan or with the approval of the FDIC.  Institutions that are significantly undercapitalized or undercapitalized and either fail to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan or fail to implement an approved capital restoration plan may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks.  Critically undercapitalized depository institutions failing to submit or implement an acceptable capital restoration plan are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator.
 ﻿
 The Company’s regulatory capital ratios under risk-based capital rules in effect through December 31, 2018 are presented in Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 ﻿
 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act)
 The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in 2010, is widely regarded as the most sweeping change to financial regulation since the Great Depression.  The law was intended to promote robust supervision and regulation of financial firms; establish comprehensive supervision of financial markets; protect consumers and investors from financial abuse; provide the government with the tools to manage a financial crisis; and raise international regulatory standards and improve international cooperation.  Some of the most significant aspects of The Dodd-Frank Act include:
I. | The creation of a new oversight regulator, the Financial Stability Oversight Council. The council of regulators monitors the financial system for systemic risk and will determine which entities pose significant systemic risk and should be subject to greater federal regulation and oversight. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

II. | The Collins Amendment, which requires the federal banking agencies to establish minimum leverage capital and risk-based capital requirements for insured depository institutions, depository institution holding companies and non-bank financial companies supervised by the FRB (also known as systemically significant financial institutions). The Collins Amendment provides that certain hybrid financial instruments, such as trust preferred securities, issued on or after May 19, 2010, are excluded from Tier 1 capital. For certain large depository institution holding companies (greater than $15 billion in assets at December 31, 2009), hybrid financial instruments issued before May 19, 2010 were phased out of Tier 1 capital over a three-year period beginning January 1, 2013. The Company was well below this threshold at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2018, the Company had $11.3 million in trust preferred securities included in Tier 1 capital.

III. | The Durbin Amendment, which provided that interchange fees that a card issuer or payment network receives or charges for debit transactions will now be regulated by the FRB and must be “reasonable and proportional” to the cost incurred by the card issuer in authorizing, clearing and settling the transaction. The pricing provisions of the Durbin Amendment apply to card issuing financial institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. The Durbin Amendment also prohibits all issuers and networks from restricting the number of networks over which electronic debit transactions may be processed to less than two unaffiliated networks, and prohibits issuers and networks from inhibiting a merchant’s ability to direct the routing of the electronic debit transaction over any network that the issuer has enabled to process them. Although the Bank is exempt from the pricing provisions of the Durbin Amendment, it has been indirectly impacted as it competes with other institutions who are directly impacted by the Durbin Amendment.

IV. | A number of deposit insurance reforms, which have generally benefited the Bank. First, the Dodd-Frank Act redefined the deposit insurance assessment base to reflect consolidated total assets less average tangible equity. The result is that larger financial institutions, which have more assets leveraged with non-deposit wholesale funds, have paid a greater percentage of the aggregate insurance assessment, while smaller banks (such as the Bank) have paid less than they would have under the prior rules. The Dodd-Frank Act also increased the minimum reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund from 1.15% to 1.35%, but exempted institutions with assets less than $10 billion from funding the cost of the increase. The act also permanently increased deposit insurance coverage to $250,000 per account (subject to certain limitations).

V. | A permanent exemption from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“SOX”), which requires that public companies receive an opinion from their external auditors as to the effectiveness of their internal control over financial reporting, for companies with a public market capitalization under $75 million. The Company does not qualify for this exemption.

VII. | The imposition of new regulations on mortgage loan originators, including the imposition of new disclosure requirements and appraisal reforms, such as: the creation of a mortgage originator duty of care; the establishment of certain underwriting requirements designed to ensure that at the time of origination the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay the loan; the creation of document requirements intended to eliminate “no document” and “low document” loans; the prohibition of steering incentives for mortgage originators; a prohibition on yield spread premiums and prepayment penalties in some cases; and a provision that allows borrowers to assert as a foreclosure defense a contention that the lender violated the anti-steering restrictions or the reasonable repayment requirements.

VIII. | In December 2013, five federal agencies (including the FRB and the OCC) adopted a final regulation implementing the “Volcker Rule” provision of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Volcker Rule generally prohibits insured banks and their affiliates from proprietary trading or from acquiring or retaining any equity, partnership or other ownership interest in, sponsoring or having certain other relationships with a hedge fund or a private equity fund, subject to certain exceptions. The Volcker Rule has not had an impact on the operations of the Company or the Bank, as they do not engage in the activities prohibited by the Volcker Rule.

  2018 Regulatory Reform – The EGRRCPA
 In May 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the “EGRRCPA”), was enacted to modify or remove certain financial reform rules and regulations, including some of those implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act.  While the EGRRCPA maintains most of the regulatory structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act, it amends certain aspects of the regulatory framework for small depository institutions with assets of less than $10 billion and for large banks with assets of more than $50 billion.  Many of these changes could result in meaningful regulatory relief for community banks such as the Bank.
 The EGRRCPA, among other matters, expands the definition of qualified mortgages which may be held by a financial institution and simplifies the regulatory capital rules for financial institutions and their holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion by instructing the federal banking regulators to establish a single “Community Bank Leverage Ratio” of between 8-10%. Any qualifying depository institution or its holding company that exceeds the “community bank leverage ratio” will be considered to have met generally applicable leverage and risk-based regulatory capital requirements and any qualifying depository institution that exceeds the new ratio will be considered to be “well capitalized” under the prompt corrective action rules.  The EGRRCPA also expands the category of holding companies that may rely on the “Small Bank Holding Company and Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement” (the “HC Policy Statement”) by raising the maximum amount of assets a qualifying holding company may have from $1 billion to $3 billion.  This expansion also excludes such holding companies from the minimum capital requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act.  In addition, the EGRRCPA includes regulatory relief for community banks regarding regulatory examination cycles, call reports, the Volcker Rule, mortgage disclosures and risk weights for certain high-risk commercial real estate loans.
 The EGRRCPA requires the enactment of a number of implementing regulations, the details of which may have a material effect on the ultimate impact of the law.  It is difficult at this time to predict when or how any new standards under the EGRRCPA will ultimately be applied to us or what specific impact the EGRRCPA, and the yet-to-be-written implementing rules and regulations, will have on community banks.

 ﻿
 Monetary Policy and Economic Control
 ﻿
 The commercial banking business is affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the monetary policies of the FRB.  Changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowing, availability of borrowing at the “discount window,” open market operations, the imposition of changes in reserve requirements against member banks’ deposits and assets of foreign branches and the imposition of, and changes in, reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates are some of the instruments of monetary policy available to the FRB.  These monetary policies are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distributions of bank loans, investments and deposits, and this use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.  The monetary policies of the FRB have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks and are expected to continue to do so in the future.  The monetary policies of these agencies are influenced by various factors, including inflation, unemployment, and short-term and long-term changes in the international trade balance and in the fiscal policies of the United States Government.  Future monetary policies and the effect of such policies on the future business and earnings of the Company cannot be predicted.
 ﻿
 Consumer Laws and Regulations
 ﻿
 In addition to the laws and regulations discussed herein, the Bank is also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, the Bank Secrecy Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Federal Financial Privacy Laws, Interagency Guidelines Establishing Information Security Standards, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, and the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Reporting Act. These laws and regulations regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits or making loans to such customers.

 ﻿
 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
 ﻿
 The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”), which represents one of the most significant overhauls to the United States federal tax code since 1986, was signed into law on December 22, 2017.  The most significant impact of the TCJA has been on the Company’s marginal federal tax rate in 2018 and beyond, which decreased from 35% to 21%. The change in the corporate tax rate resulted in a $2.1 million expense related to the remeasurement of the Company’s deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2017.  Approximately $0.6 million of the $2.1 million expense is associated with deferred taxes related to unrealized gains on available-for-sale investment securities and the unamortized actuarial losses on the Pension Plan and the SERPs which were originally created through other comprehensive income (“OCI”).  The Company reclassified the $0.6 million charge related to deferred tax expense for items originally recorded through OCI from OCI to retained earnings per ASU 2018-02, “Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income,” released in February 2018 and early adopted by the Company for the period ended December 31, 2017.  
 ﻿
 Other significant aspects of the TCJA that have a direct impact on the Company include:
 ﻿

· | The Company is active in the historic rehabilitation tax credit (“HTC”) market. Before TCJA, HTC’s were allowed for 20% of qualified rehabilitation expenses (“QRE”) in the year the property is placed in service. For properties owned before December 31, 2017 on which construction was started by June 22, 2018 and completed by December 22, 2019, the old rules still apply. The Company has two remaining projects that fit these criteria. For all other projects, the HTC for 20% of QRE will now be taken over a 5 year period rather than all in the first year. This delay in cash flows to investors has negatively impacted the pricing on HTC’s. The Company earned $1.2 million in net income on HTC investments in 2018 and had historic tax credit investments valued at $1.2 million as of December 31, 2018. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The TCJA limits the deductibility of executive compensation. The TCJA expands the definition of “covered employees” for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code to include the CFO, CEO, and the three most highly compensated officers for the tax year and, once designated as a covered employee, an individual is a covered employees for all future years. Previously, if a covered employee retired, the individual would no longer be considered “covered” in retirement and therefore post-retirement payments to that individual would not be limited by Section 162(m). This change impacts the SERP for one of the Company’s executive officers, who elected to receive his benefit in a lump sum payment. In August 2018, the IRS issued Notice 2018-68, which provided guidance with respect to the amendments made to Section 162(m) and provided a transition rule applicable to certain outstanding arrangements (referred to as the “grandfather rule”). Notice 2018-68 defines the term “written binding contract” for purposes of grandfathering. Remuneration is grandfathered if it is payable under a written binding contract that was in effect on November 2, 2017, and not materially modified after that date, only to the extent the corporation is obligated under applicable law to pay the remuneration under the contract if the employee performs services or satisfies the vesting conditions. Therefore, for the executive in question, the Company is treating the vested portion of the SERP benefit on November 2, 2017, as subject to the grandfather rule of the new Section 162(m) so that vested portion of the SERP benefit is outside the scope of Section 162(m) and therefore deductible. Any increase in the executive’s SERP obligation after November 2, 2017 will be subject to the Section 162(m) limits on deductibility.

  ﻿

· | The TCJA allows for 100% deduction of the cost of qualified property acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017 and before January 1, 2023. This benefit is scheduled to phase out in full by 2027. Management expects that this will allow the Company to deduct capital expenses in full in the year of acquisition rather than over a period of time (3-7 years). This is expected to delay tax payments for the Company but is unlikely to have a material effect on results of operations. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | The TCJA repeals the 50% deduction for entertainment, amusement, or recreation activities and disallows employer deductions for meals provided for the convenience of the employer. The impact of this change has not been material to the Company. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 Given the complexity of the TCJA and on-going guidance from the U.S. Treasury regarding implementation of the TCJA it is possible there will be adjustments to the Company’s results of operations to reflect any such guidance provided.

﻿
 Item 1A.RISK FACTORS
 ﻿
 The following factors identified by the Company's management represent significant potential risks that the Company faces in its operations.
 ﻿
 The Company’s Business May Be Adversely Affected by Conditions in the Financial Markets and Economic Conditions Generally
 The Company’s financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where the Company operates, in Western New York and in the United States as a whole. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, economic growth, efficient capital markets, low inflation, high business and investor confidence, and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by: declines in economic growth, declines in housing and real estate valuations, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; natural disasters; or a combination of these or other factors.
 Economic conditions in the United States remained positive in 2018, which included national and local unemployment rates of 3.9% and 4.1%, respectively, as of December 31, 2018.  Although conditions in Western New York and the United States are currently good, a slowdown of the economy could occur in the future.  The last recession ended in 2009 and has been followed by 114 months of economic expansion.  In the post-World War II era, the average period of economic expansion has been 57 months.  This could indicate that we are in a longer than normal period of economic expansion and that there is increased risk of recession.   Even though the Company is a community institution servicing a local market, in a global economy, any deteriorating conditions in other parts of the world could affect the United States economically.  Such conditions could materially adversely affect the credit quality of the Company’s loans, and therefore, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.
 ﻿
 Commercial Real Estate and Commercial Business Loans Expose the Company to Increased Credit Risks
 At December 31, 2018, the Company's portfolio of commercial real estate loans totaled $698 million, or 60% of total loans outstanding, and the Company's portfolio of commercial and industrial (“C&I”) loans totaled $226 million, or 20% of total loans outstanding.  The Company plans to continue to emphasize the origination of commercial loans as they generally earn a higher rate of interest than other loan products offered by the Bank.  However, commercial loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans because repayment of commercial real estate and C&I loans often depends on the successful operations and the income stream of the borrowers.  Commercial mortgages are collateralized by real property while C&I loans are typically secured by business assets such as equipment and accounts receivable.  Commercial loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one-to-four-family residential mortgage loans.  Also, many of the Company's commercial borrowers have more than one commercial real estate or C&I loan outstanding with the Company.  Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose the Company to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one-to-four-family residential mortgage loan.  Commercial real estate loans in non-accrual status at December 31, 2018 were $14.6 million, compared with $8.9 million at December 31, 2017.  C&I loans in non-accrual status at December 31, 2018 were $1.7 million, unchanged from December 31, 2017.  Increases in the delinquency levels of commercial real estate and C&I loans could result in an increase in non-performing loans and the provision for loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.
 ﻿
 Continuing Concentration of Loans in the Company's Primary Market Area May Increase the Company's Risk
 ﻿
 Unlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified, the Company provides banking and financial services to customers located primarily in western New York State (“WNY”).  Therefore, the Company's success depends primarily on the general economic conditions in WNY.  The Company's business lending and marketing strategies focus on loans to small and medium-sized businesses in this geographic region.  Moreover, the Company's assets are heavily concentrated in mortgages on properties located in WNY.  Accordingly, the Company's business and operations are vulnerable to downturns in the economy of WNY.  The concentration of the Company's loans in this geographic region subjects the Company to the risk that a downturn in the economy or recession in this region could result in a decrease in loan originations and increases in delinquencies and foreclosures, which would more greatly affect the Company than if the Company's lending were more geographically diversified.  In addition, the Company may suffer losses if there is a decline in the value of properties underlying the Company's mortgage loans which would have a material adverse impact on the Company's operations.

 ﻿
 In the Event the Company's Allowance for Loan Losses is Not Sufficient to Cover Actual Loan Losses, the Company's Earnings Could Decrease
 ﻿
 The Company maintains an allowance for loan losses in order to capture the probable losses inherent in its loan portfolio.  There is a risk that the Company may experience significant loan losses which could exceed the allowance for loan losses.  In determining the amount of the Company's recorded allowance, the Company makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of its loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of its borrowers, the effect of changes in the local economy on the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans, the effects on the Company's loan portfolio of current economic indicators and their probable impact on borrowers, and the Company's loan quality reviews.  The emphasis on the origination of commercial real estate and C&I loans is a significant factor in evaluating the allowance for loan losses.  As the Company continues to increase the amount of these loans in the portfolio, additional or increased provisions for loan losses may be necessary and would adversely affect the results of operations.  In addition, bank regulators periodically review the Company's loan portfolio and credit underwriting procedures, as well as its allowance for loan losses, and may require the Company to increase its provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs.  At December 31, 2018, the Company had a gross loan portfolio of $1.2 billion and the allowance for loan losses was $14.8 million, which represented 1.28% of the total amount of gross loans.  If the Company's assumptions and judgments prove to be incorrect or bank regulators require the Company to increase its provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs, the Company may have to increase its allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs which could have an adverse effect on the Company's operating results and financial condition.  Additionally, there can be no assurances that the Company's allowance for loan losses will be adequate to protect the Company against loan losses that it may incur.
 ﻿
 Changes in Interest Rates Could Adversely Affect the Company's Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 ﻿
 The Company's results of operations and financial condition are significantly affected by changes in interest rates.  The Company's results of operations depend substantially on its net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on its interest-earning assets and the interest expense paid on its interest-bearing liabilities.  Because the Company's interest-bearing liabilities generally re-price or mature more quickly than its interest-earning assets, an increase in interest rates could result in a decrease in its net interest income.
 ﻿
 Changes in interest rates also affect the value of the Company's interest-earning assets, and in particular, the Company's securities portfolio.  Generally, the value of securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates.  At December 31, 2018, the Company's securities available for sale totaled $134 million.  Net unrealized losses on securities available for sale amounted to $2.3 million, net of tax.  Decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale could have an adverse effect on stockholders' equity or earnings.
 ﻿
 The Company also is subject to reinvestment risk associated with changes in interest rates.  Changes in interest rates may affect the average life of loans and mortgage-related securities.  Decreases in interest rates can result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities, as borrowers refinance to reduce borrowing costs.  Under these circumstances, the Company is subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that it is unable to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates on existing loans and securities.  Additionally, increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans.
 ﻿
 As of December 31, 2018, the FRB had raised the targeted federal funds rate a total of 1.00% since December 2017.  These actions have begun to put pressure on the Company’s funding costs.  The cost of the Company’s interest-bearing liabilities increased in 2018 as the Company’s reliance on time deposits increased and low-cost savings deposit growth lagged.  There is risk that funding costs could continue to increase and that margin compression could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.
 ﻿
 The Company May Be Adversely Affected by the Soundness of Other Financial Institutions
 ﻿
 Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of counterparty relationships.  The Company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry.  As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions and impact our business.  Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or customer.  In addition, our credit risk may be further increased when the collateral held by us cannot be relied upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to us.  Any such losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.

 ﻿
 The most important counterparty for the Company, in terms of liquidity, is the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (“FHLBNY”).  The Company uses FHLBNY as its primary source of borrowed overnight funds and also has several long-term advances with FHLBNY.  At December 31, 2018, the Company had a total of $10 million in borrowed funds with FHLBNY.  The Company has placed sufficient collateral in the form of commercial and residential real estate loans at FHLBNY.  As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, the Bank is required to hold stock in FHLBNY.  The Bank held FHLBNY stock with a fair value of $1.5 million as of December 31, 2018.
 ﻿
 There are 12 branches of the FHLB, including New York.  If a branch were at risk of breaching risk-based capital requirements, it could suspend dividends, cut dividend payments, and/or not buy back excess FHLB stock that members hold.  FHLBNY has stated that they expect to be able to continue to pay dividends, redeem excess capital stock, and provide competitively priced advances in the future.  Nonetheless, the 12 FHLB branches are jointly liable for the consolidated obligations of the FHLB system.  To the extent that one FHLB branch cannot meet its obligations to pay its share of the system’s debt; other FHLB branches can be called upon to make the payment.
 Systemic weakness in the FHLB could result in higher costs of FHLB borrowings, reduced value of FHLB stock, and increased demand for alternative sources of liquidity that are more expensive, such as brokered time deposits, the discount window at the Federal Reserve, or lines of credit with correspondent banks First Tennessee Bank and M&T Bank.
 A Decline in the Value of the Company’s Deferred Tax Assets Could Adversely Affect the Company’s Operating Results and Regulatory Capital Ratios. 
 The Company’s tax strategies depend on the ability to generate taxable income in future periods. The Company’s tax strategies will be less effective in the event the Company fails to generate anticipated amounts of taxable income. The value of the Company’s deferred tax assets is subject to an evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that they will be realized for financial statement purposes. In making this determination, management considers all positive and negative evidence available, including the Company’s historical levels of taxable income, the opportunity for net operating loss carrybacks, and projections for future taxable income over the statutory tax loss carryover period. If the Company were to conclude that a significant portion of deferred tax assets were not more likely than not to be realized, the required valuation allowance could adversely affect the Company’s financial position, results of operations and regulatory capital ratios. In addition, the value of the Company’s deferred tax assets could be adversely affected by a change in statutory tax rates.
 ﻿
 The TCJA Included Significant Changes in Tax Legislation Which Could Result in Significant Changes to the Company’s Future Tax Positions, Consumer Behavior, the Economy and Competition.  
 Given the significant change in the US tax law under the TCJA, there could be any number of consequences to the US economy and therefore the Company.  While corporations will benefit from the reduction in the federal income tax rate, the implications could result in more aggressive loan and deposit pricing or increased advertising by direct competitors of the Company or wage inflation that would increase the Company’s salaries and benefits costs.  Further, changes in the federal tax code for individuals could drive changes in consumer behavior that could impact the Company.  For example, new caps on the deductibility of mortgage interest could adversely affect the residential real estate market including a reduction in home prices (including homes serving as collateral for the Bank’s current residential mortgage loans) and a preference for renting rather than owning a home.  Any such occurrences could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 HTC rules also changed under the TCJA, with new credits now being taken over five years rather than all in the year in which the project is placed in service.  This delay in cash flows to investors in HTC projects, has negatively impacted the pricing on HTC’s.  It is possible that when the Company and other HTC investors lower their price on potential HTC opportunities, developers may not have sufficient funding to complete rehabilitation projects in the future and the HTC market could continue to be diminished. 
 ﻿
 Strong Competition Within the Company's Market Area May Limit the Company’s Growth and Profitability
 ﻿
 Competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense.  The Company competes with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally within the Company's market area and elsewhere.  Many of these competitors (whether regional or national institutions) have substantially greater resources and lending limits than the Company does, and may offer certain services that the Company does not or cannot provide.  The Company's profitability depends upon its continued ability to successfully compete in this market area.
 ﻿
 Expansion of the Company’s Branch Network May Adversely Affect its Financial Results
 ﻿
 The Company cannot assure that the opening of new branches will be accretive to earnings or that it will be accretive to earnings within a reasonable period of time.  Numerous factors contribute to the performance of a new branch, such as suitable location, qualified personnel, and an effective marketing strategy.  Additionally, it takes time for a new branch to gather sufficient loans and deposits to generate income sufficient to cover its operating expenses.  Difficulties the Company experiences in opening new branches may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.

﻿
 The Company Operates in a Highly Regulated Environment and May Be Adversely Affected By Changes in Laws and Regulations
 ﻿
 The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC, FRB, and by the FDIC, as insurer of its deposits.  Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which a bank and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance funds and depositors.  Regulatory requirements affect the Company's lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth.  These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of a bank, the imposition of deposit insurance premiums and other assessments, the classification of assets by a bank and the adequacy of a bank's allowance for loan losses.  Any change in such regulation and oversight could have a material adverse impact on the Bank, the Company and its business, financial condition and results of operations.
 ﻿
 Lack of System Integrity or Credit Quality Related to Funds Settlement Could Result in a Financial Loss
 ﻿
 The Bank settles funds on behalf of financial institutions, other businesses and consumers and receives funds from clients, card issuers, payment networks and consumers on a daily basis for a variety of transaction types.  Transactions facilitated by the Bank include debit card, credit card and electronic bill payment transactions, supporting consumers, financial institutions and other businesses.  These payment activities rely upon the technology infrastructure that facilitates the verification of activity with counterparties and the facilitation of the payment.  If the continuity of operations or integrity of processing were compromised this could result in a financial loss to the Bank, and therefore the Company, due to a failure in payment facilitation.  In addition, the Bank may issue credit to consumers, financial institutions or other businesses as part of the funds settlement.  A default on this credit by a counterparty could result in a financial loss to the Bank, and therefore to the Company.
 ﻿
 Financial Services Companies Depend on the Accuracy and Completeness of Information about Customers and Counterparties
 ﻿
 In deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, the Company may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements, credit reports, and other financial information.  The Company may also rely on representations of those customers, counterparties, or other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information.  Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements, credit reports, or other financial information could cause the Company to enter into unfavorable transactions, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.
 ﻿
 Loss of Key Employees May Disrupt Relationships with Certain Customers
 ﻿
 The Company’s business is primarily relationship-driven in that many of the key employees of the Bank and TEA have extensive customer relationships.  Loss of a key employee with such customer relationships may lead to the loss of business if the customers were to follow that employee to a competitor.  While management believes that the Company’s relationships with its key business producers are good, the Company cannot guarantee that all of its key personnel will remain with the organization.  Loss of such key personnel, particularly if they enter into an employment relationship with one of the Company’s competitors, could result in the loss of some of the Company’s customers.  Such losses could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

 Future FDIC Insurance Premium Increases May Adversely Affect the Company’s Earnings 
 ﻿
 The Company is generally unable to control the amount of premiums that it is required to pay for FDIC insurance.  If there are additional bank or financial institution failures or other similar occurrences, the FDIC may again increase the premiums assessed upon insured institutions.  Such increases and any future increases or required prepayments of FDIC insurance premiums may adversely impact the Company’s results of operations.
 ﻿
 The Company is a Financial Holding Company and Depends on Its Subsidiaries for Dividends, Distributions and Other Payments 
 ﻿
 The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries. The Company’s principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends to the Company’s stockholders and principal and interest on its outstanding debt, is dividends from the Bank.  There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by the Bank, as well as the payment of dividends by the Company to its stockholders.  Regulations of the OCC affect the ability of the Bank to pay dividends and other distributions and to make loans to the Company.  If the Bank is unable to make dividend payments and sufficient capital is not otherwise available, the Company may not be able to make dividend payments to its common stockholders or principal and interest payments on its outstanding debt.

 Because the Nature of the Financial Services Business Involves a High Volume of Transactions, the Company Faces Significant Operational Risks
 ﻿
 The Company relies on the ability of its employees and systems to process a high number of transactions.  Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from the Company’s operations, including but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside of the Company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements, and business continuation and disaster recovery.  This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity.  In the event of a breakdown in the internal control system, improper operation of systems or improper employee actions, the Company could suffer financial loss, face regulatory action and suffer damage to its reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operation.
 ﻿
 The Company’s Information Systems May Experience an Interruption or Breach in Security
 ﻿
 The Company relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business.  As a financial institution, we process a significant number of customer transactions and possess a significant amount of sensitive customer information.  As technology advances, the ability to initiate transactions and access data has become more widely distributed among mobile phones, personal computers, automated teller machines, remote deposit capture sites and similar access points.  Any failure, interruption, or breach in security or operational integrity of our communications and information systems, or the systems of third parties on which we rely to process transactions, could result in failures or disruptions in the Company’s customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan, and other systems.  There can be no assurance that failures, interruptions, or security breaches of the Company’s information systems will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed.  Unauthorized third parties regularly seek to gain access to nonpublic, private and other information through computer systems. If customers’ personal, nonpublic, confidential, or proprietary information in the Company’s possession were to be mishandled or misused, we could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage, and financial loss.  Such mishandling or misuse could include, for example, if such information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of the Company’s systems, employees or counterparties, or where such information is intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties.  The occurrence of any failures, interruptions, or security breaches of the Company’s information systems could, among other consequences, damage the Company’s reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject the Company to additional regulatory scrutiny, result in increased insurance premiums, or expose the Company to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.
 ﻿
 In addition, as cybersecurity and data privacy risks for banking organizations and the broader financial system have significantly increased in recent years, cybersecurity and data privacy issues have become the subject of increasing legislative and regulatory focus. The federal bank regulatory agencies have proposed enhanced cyber risk management standards, which would apply to a wide range of large financial institutions and their third-party service providers, and would focus on cyber risk governance and management, management of internal and external dependencies, and incident response, cyber resilience and situational awareness.  We may become subject to new legislation or regulation concerning cybersecurity or the privacy of personally identifiable information and personal financial information or of any other information we may store or maintain.  We could be adversely affected if new legislation or regulations are adopted or if existing legislation or regulations are modified such that we are required to alter our systems or require changes to our business practices or privacy policies.  If cybersecurity, data privacy, data protection, data transfer or data retention laws are implemented, interpreted or applied in a manner inconsistent with our current practices, we may be subject to fines, litigation or regulatory enforcement actions or ordered to change our business practices, policies or systems in a manner that adversely impacts our operating results  In addition, increased cost of compliance with cybersecurity regulations, at the federal and state level, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.  
 ﻿
 The Potential for Business Interruption Exists Throughout the Company’s Organization
 ﻿
 Integral to the Company’s performance is the continued efficacy of our technical systems, operational infrastructure, relationships with third parties and the vast array of associates and key executives in the Company’s day-to-day and ongoing operations.  Failure by any or all of these resources subjects the Company to risks that may vary in size, scale and scope.  This includes, but is not limited to, operational or technical failures, pandemics, ineffectiveness or exposure due to interruption in third party support as expected, as well as the loss of key individuals or failure on the part of key individuals to perform properly.  The occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.

 ﻿
 Environmental Factors May Create Liability
 ﻿
 In the course of its business, the Bank has acquired, and may acquire in the future, property securing loans that are in default.  There is a risk that the Bank could be required to investigate and clean-up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at such properties after acquisition by the Bank in a foreclosure action, and that the Bank may be held liable to a governmental entity or third parties for property damage, personal injury and investigation and clean-up costs incurred by such parties in connection with such contamination.  The Bank may in the future be required to perform an investigation or clean-up activities in connection with environmental claims.  Any such occurrence could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 ﻿
 Anti-Takeover Laws and Certain Agreements and Charter Provisions May Adversely Affect Share Value
 ﻿
 Certain provisions of the Company’s certificate of incorporation and state and federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of the Company without approval of the Company’s board of directors.  Under federal law, subject to certain exemptions, a person, entity or group must notify the FRB before acquiring control of a bank holding company.  Acquisition of 10% or more of any class of voting stock of a bank holding company, including shares of the Company’s common stock, creates a rebuttable presumption that the acquiror “controls” the bank holding company. Also, a bank holding company must obtain the prior approval of the FRB before, among other things, acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any bank, including the Bank. There also are provisions in the Company’s certificate of incorporation that may be used to delay or block a takeover attempt.  Taken as a whole, these statutory provisions and provisions in the Company’s certificate of incorporation could result in the Company being less attractive to a potential acquiror and thus could adversely affect the market price of the Company’s common stock.
 ﻿
 Damage to the Company’s Reputation Could Adversely Impact our Business
 ﻿
 The Company’s business reputation is important to its success.  The ability to attract and retain customers, investors, employees and advisors may depend upon external perceptions of the Company.  Damage to the Company’s reputation could cause significant harm to its business and prospects and may arise from numerous sources, including litigation or regulatory actions, failing to deliver minimum standards of service and quality, compliance failures, unethical behavior and the misconduct of employees, advisors and counterparties.  Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters could damage the Company’s reputation among existing and potential customers, investors, employees and advisors.  Adverse developments with respect to the financial services industry may also, by association, negatively impact the Company’s reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against the Company.  Preserving and enhancing the Company’s reputation also depends on maintaining systems and procedures that address known risks and regulatory requirements, as well as its ability to identify and mitigate additional risks that arise due to changes in businesses and the marketplaces in which the Company operates, the regulatory environment and client expectations.  If any of these developments has a material effect on the Company’s reputation, its business could suffer.
