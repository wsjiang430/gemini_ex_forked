Item 1. Business
 
The ONE Group Hospitality, Inc., a Delaware corporation, develops, owns and operates, manages or licenses upscale, high-energy restaurants and lounges and provides turn-key food and beverage services for hospitality venues including hotels, casinos and other high-end locations globally. We define turn-key food and beverage (“F&B”) services as services that can be scaled and implemented by us at a particular hospitality venue and customized for our clients. We became The ONE Group Hospitality, Inc. through a reverse merger completed in October 2013. Our stock trades on the NASDAQ under the symbol “STKS”.
 
The Company was established with the vision of becoming a global market leader in the hospitality industry by melding high-quality service, ambiance, high-energy and cuisine into one great experience that we refer to as “Vibe Dining.” Our primary restaurant brand is STK, a multi-unit steakhouse concept that combines a high-energy, social atmosphere with the quality and service of a traditional upscale steakhouse. Our F&B hospitality management services include developing, managing and operating restaurants, bars, rooftop lounges, pools, banqueting and catering facilities, private dining rooms, room service and mini bars tailored to the specific needs of high-end hotels and casinos. Our F&B hospitality clients operate global hospitality brands such as the W Hotel, Hippodrome Casino, and ME Hotels.
 
We opened our first restaurant in January 2004 in New York City and as of December 31, 2018, we owned, operated, managed or licensed 27 venues including 17 STKs in major metropolitan cities in North America, Europe and the Middle East. In addition, we provided food and beverage services in four hotels and casinos. We generate management and incentive fee revenue (profit sharing) from those restaurants and lounges that we do not own, but instead manage on behalf of our F&B hospitality clients. All our restaurants, lounges and F&B services are designed to create a social dining and high-energy entertainment experience within a destination location. We believe that this design and operating philosophy separates us from more traditional restaurant and foodservice competitors.

We expect to continue to expand our operations domestically and internationally primarily through a mix of licensed and managed restaurants using a disciplined and targeted site selection process. We refer to this as our “capital light strategy” because it requires significantly less capital than expansion through owned restaurants. We currently anticipate that our expansion plans will require capital expenditures, net of improvement allowances, of $1.0 million to $1.5 million over the next 12 months.
 
STK
 
STK is a global steakhouse restaurant concept with locations in major metropolitan cities. STK artfully blends the modern steakhouse and a chic lounge, offering a high-energy, fine dining experience in a social atmosphere with the quality and service of a traditional upscale steakhouse. Each STK location features a large, open restaurant and bar area with a DJ playing music throughout the restaurant, offering our customers a high-energy, fun “destination” environment that encourages social interaction. We believe this Vibe Dining concept truly differentiates us from other upscale steakhouses. Our menu provides a variety of portion sizes and signature options to appeal to a broad customer demographic. We operate nine owned, four managed and four licensed STK restaurants in major metropolitan cities, including Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Dubai, Ibiza, Las Vegas, London, Los Angeles, Mexico City, Miami, Milan, New York, Orlando and Toronto. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2019, we opened an owned STK restaurant in Nashville, Tennessee and a licensed STK restaurant in Doha, Qatar.
 
We expect to continue to grow in 2019 with the planned openings of licensed STK locations in Puerto Rico and Guadalajara, Mexico and a managed STK location in Scottsdale, Arizona.
 
Our STK restaurants average approximately 10,000 square feet and we typically target locations that range in size from 8,000 to 10,000 square feet. In 2018, the average restaurant volume, domestic check average and beverage mix for owned and managed STK restaurants that have been open 18 months at December 31, 2018 were $11.0 million, $106.96 and 36%, respectively.
 
We are focused on expanding our global footprint. We believe that the locations of our restaurants are critical to our long-term success, and we devote significant time and resources to analyzing prospective restaurant sites. We intend to continue our focus on (i) metropolitan areas with demographic and discretionary spending profiles that favor our high-end concepts and (ii) finding partners with excellent track records and brand recognition. We also consider factors such as traffic patterns, proximity to high-end shopping areas and office buildings, hotels and convention centers, area restaurant competition, accessibility and visibility. We have identified over 75 additional major metropolitan areas across the globe where we could grow our STK brand to 200 restaurants over the foreseeable future.
 
We expect to open as many as three to five STKs annually primarily through licensing and management agreements, provided that we have sufficient interest from prospective licensees and management deal partners, acceptable locations and quality restaurant managers available to support that pace of growth. From time to time, based on the financial quality of the opportunity (relatively low investment cost and high financial return, we may open one or more company-owned restaurants.

Bagatelle
 
Bagatelle NY is a fine French bistro in New York, New York offering modern Mediterranean cuisine in an opulent atmosphere and is known for its lively brunch scene. In addition to a management agreement with Bagatelle NY, we have a 51.13% ownership interest in the restaurant which is reflected as an equity method investment.
Radio
 
Radio Rooftop is a premier rooftop restaurant and lounge bar concept with two signature locations on top of the ME London and ME Milan hotels. Each location boasts striking city views and offers a glamourous atmosphere with extensive food and cocktail menus.
Hideout
 
The Hideout by STK is an outdoor, poolside restaurant and bar within the W Hotel in Westwood, California. Our poolside concept complements our owned STK and F&B hospitality services also offered with the W Hotel in Westwood.
Marconi
 
The Marconi Lounge is a stylish and sophisticated lounge bar offering an extensive cocktail menu in an upbeat atmosphere. The Marconi Lounge is an additional venue concept we manage within the ME London hotel.
Heliot
 
Heliot Steak House is an award-winning steakhouse and bar located within the Hipprodrome Casino in London. Heliot offers impressive views of the main casino gambling floor while providing a luxurious, fine dining experience.
F&B Hospitality Services Business
 
We believe that through our developmental and operational know-how, we are able to provide attractive, comprehensive tailored food and beverage solutions to our hospitality clients. Our fee-based hospitality food and beverage solutions include developing, managing and operating restaurants, bars, rooftops, pools, banqueting, catering, private dining rooms, room service and mini bars on a contract basis. Currently we are operating under four F&B hospitality management agreements with hotels and casinos in the United States and in Europe. Historically, our clients have provided the majority of the capital required for the development of the facilities we manage on their behalf.
 
Our F&B hospitality contracts generate revenues for us through management fees, which are typically calculated as a percentage of the operation’s revenues, and we earn additional milestone and incentive fees based on the operation’s profitability. We typically target F&B hospitality service opportunities where we believe we can generate at least $500,000 of annual pre-tax income. We expect our food and beverage hospitality services business to be an important driver of our growth and profitability, enabling us to generate management fee income with minimal capital expenditures.
 
We believe we are well positioned to leverage the strength of our brands and the relationships we have developed with global hospitality providers to drive the continued growth of our F&B hospitality business. We continue to receive inbound inquiries regarding new opportunities globally, and we continue to work with existing hospitality clients to identify and develop additional opportunities in their venues. We expect to enter into one to two new F&B hospitality agreements annually. In 2019, we plan to add two hotel managed F&B locations in London, England, both pursuant to one management agreement, and one managed F&B location in Florence, Italy.
 
Sourcing and Supply Chain
 
We seek to ensure that consistently high-quality food and beverages are served at all of our properties through the coordination and cooperation of our purchasing and culinary departments. Our culinary and purchasing teams establish product specifications on a global basis, which are then disseminated to all locations through recipe books for all dishes served at our properties.
 
We maintain consistent pricing standards and procedures for all top volume purchases at our restaurants. Suppliers are selected and pricing is negotiated on a national level in each country where one or more of our restaurants operate. We test new suppliers on a regional basis for an extended period before using them on a national basis. We periodically review supplier consistency and satisfaction with our location chefs and continually research and evaluate products and supplies to ensure the meat, seafood and other menu ingredients that we purchase comply with our high-quality specifications. We also utilize purchasing software at some of our locations to facilitate a bidding process on local purchases. In markets where we do not use this software, we require local chefs to seek bids from multiple suppliers to ensure competitive pricing. We believe we have strong relationships with national and regional foodservice distributors who can continue to supply us with our products on a consistent basis. Products are shipped directly to the restaurants from our suppliers.

Our corporate beverage program imposes guidelines for ordering beverage products at our properties. We provide beverage managers at each location with national guidelines for standardized products. We utilize a third-party company to conduct beverage inventory and cost reviews. Our concepts emphasize the bar as a driver of activity in the restaurants and in 2018, the sale of beverages accounted for approximately 36% of restaurant revenues.
 
On a company-wide basis, no supplier of food accounts for more than 30% of our total food and beverage purchases and no brand of alcohol accounts for more than 25% of our alcohol purchases. We believe that our food and beverage supplies are available from a significant number of alternate suppliers and that the loss of a supplier would not have a material adverse effect on our costs of supplies.
 
Advertising and Marketing
 
Our marketing efforts are designed to strengthen our brand recognition in markets where we currently operate and to create brand awareness in new markets before opening a new location. We use digital/social media channels, targeted local media such as magazines, billboards and other out-of-home advertising, and a strong internal public relations team to increase the frequency with which our existing customers visit our facilities and to attract new customers. We conduct frequent promotional programs tailored to the city, brand and clientele of each location. The primary focus of our marketing is to increase awareness of our brand and our overall reputation for quality, service and delivering a high-energy experience. For example, our “Not Your Daddy’s Steakhouse” branding campaign for STK is integrated into marketing communications including digital, radio, print and outdoor advertisement. Additional marketing functions include the use of our website, www.STKsteakhouse.com, to facilitate online reservations and gift card sales to drive revenue.
 
Competition
 
The restaurant and hospitality industries are intensely competitive with respect to price, quality of service, location, ambiance of facilities and type and quality of food. We experience competition from a variety of sources, including upscale steakhouse chains such as Del Frisco’s, Flemings, Mastro’s and The Capital Grille, and local upscale steakhouses. There is also competition from other Vibe Dining restaurants such as Nobu, Lavo and Tao and other high-end hospitality services companies such as the Gerber Group, Lettuce Entertain You and Esquared Hospitality. To the extent that we operate lounges and similar venues in hotels and resorts, we are subject to our host venues being able to compete effectively in attracting customers who would frequent our establishments.
Seasonality
 
Our business is subject to fluctuations due to seasonality and adverse weather. Because of the seasonality of the business and the industry, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for any other quarter or the full calendar year. Typically, our second and fourth quarters have higher sales volume than other quarters of the year.
Intellectual Property
 
Our rights in our registered and unregistered intellectual property, including trademarks and service marks, are significant to our business. We own the U.S. federal registration rights to the “STK,” “Cucina Asellina” and “Asellina” marks, and several related word marks and design marks related to our brands. We depend on registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks to maintain the identity of our locations. We license the rights to use certain trademarks we own or license to our licensees in connection with their operations. We also own several other trademarks and service marks. It is our policy to defend our marks against encroachment by others.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we employed 32 corporate employees within our corporate offices and an aggregate of 99 full-time salaried employees at all of our locations. We rely on hourly-wage employees for kitchen staff, servers, bussers, runners, polishers, hosts, bartenders, barbacks, reservationists, administrative support, and interns. The average head count for employees in our domestic restaurants is 86. Combining full-time and part-time employees, we employ and manage approximately 2,000 persons worldwide. We have never experienced a work stoppage, and none of our employees are represented by labor organization.

Government Regulation
 
Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local governmental regulation, including health, safety, labor, sanitation, building and fire agencies in the state, county, municipality or jurisdiction in which the restaurant is located. In certain states, our restaurants are subject to “dram shop” statutes, which generally provides a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person. We maintain the necessary restaurant, alcoholic beverage and retail licenses, permits and approvals. Federal and state labor laws govern our relationship with our employees and affect operating costs. The development and construction of additional restaurants are also subject to compliance with applicable zoning, land use and environmental regulations. A failure to comply with one or more regulations could result in the imposition of sanctions, including the closing of restaurants for an indeterminate period of time, fines or third-party litigation.
Available Information
 
We are subject to the information requirements of the Exchange Act. We therefore file period reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Such reports may be obtained by visiting the Public Reference Room of the SEC at 100F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549, or by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
