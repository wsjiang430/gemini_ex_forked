Item 1. Business.
General
 
Advaxis, Inc. (“Advaxis” or the “Company”) is a late-stage biotechnology Company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of proprietary Listeria monocytogenes (“Lm”) Technology antigen delivery products based on a platform technology that utilizes live attenuated Lm bioengineered to secrete antigen/adjuvant fusion proteins. These Lm-based strains are believed to be a significant advancement in immunotherapy as they integrate multiple functions into a single immunotherapy and are designed to access and direct antigen presenting cells to stimulate anti-tumor T cell immunity, activate the immune system with the equivalent of multiple adjuvants, and simultaneously reduce tumor protection in the Tumor Microenvironment (“TME”) to enable T cells to eliminate tumors. The Company believes that Lm Technology immunotherapies can complement and address significant unmet needs in the current oncology treatment landscape. Specifically, the Company’s product candidates have the potential to optimize the clinical impact of checkpoint inhibitors while having a generally well-tolerated safety profile. The Company’s passion for the clinical potential of Lm Technology is balanced by focus and fiscal discipline which is directed towards improving treatment options for cancer patients and increasing shareholder value.
 
Advaxis is focused on four product-related areas in various stages of clinical and pre-clinical development, which they believe will provide the greatest opportunity to have a significant impact on patients and their families:
 

● | Human Papilloma Virus (“HPV”)-associated cancers 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Personalized neoantigen-directed therapies 
● | Disease focused hotspot/‘off the shelf’ neoantigen-directed therapies 
● | Prostate cancer 



All four product areas are anchored in the Company’s Lm TechnologyTM, a unique platform designed for its ability to target various cancers in multiple ways. As an intracellular bacterium, Lm is an effective vector for the presentation of antigens through both the Major Histocompatibility Complex (“MHC”) I and II pathways, due to its active phagocytosis by Antigen Presenting Cells (“APCs”). Within the APCs, Lm produces virulence factors which allow survival in the host cytosol and potently stimulate the immune system.
 
Through a license from the University of Pennsylvania, Advaxis has exclusive access to a proprietary formulation of attenuated Lm that we call Lm Technology. Lm Technology is designed to optimize this natural system, and one of the keys to the enhanced immunogenicity of Lm Technology is the tLLO – fusion protein, which is made up of tumor associated antigen (“TAA”) fused to a highly immunogenic bacterial protein that triggers potent cellular immunity. The tLLO -fusion protein is also designed to help reduce immune tolerance in the TME and to promote antigen spreading, thereby improving activity in the TME. Multiple copies of the tLLO -fusion protein within each construct may increase antigen presentation and TME impact.
 
As the field of immunotherapy continues to evolve, the flexibility of the Lm Technology platform has allowed Advaxis to develop highly innovative products. To date, Lm Technology has demonstrated preclinical synergy with multiple checkpoint inhibitors, co-stimulatory agents and radiation therapy, with a clinical trial currently underway in combination with Merck & Co., Inc.’s (“Merck”) PD-1 inhibitor. The safety profile of all Lm Technology constructs seen to date across over 470 patients has been generally predictable and manageable, consisting mostly of mild to moderate flu-like symptoms that have been transient and associated with infusion.

The Advaxis Corporate Strategy
 
The Advaxis corporate strategy is to advance the Lm Technology platform and leverage its unique capabilities to design and develop an array of cancer treatments. The Company and its collaborators are currently conducting or planning clinical studies of Lm Technology immunotherapies in HPV-associated cancers (including cervical and head and neck), prostate cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and microsatellite stable colorectal cancer.
 
Moving forward, the Company expects that it will continue to invest in its core clinical program areas and will also remain opportunistic in evaluating Investigator Sponsored Trials (“ISTs”) as well as licensing opportunities. The Lm Technology platform is protected by a range of patents, covering both product and process, some of which the Company believes can be maintained into 2037.
 
Lm Technology and the Immunotherapy Landscape
 
The challenge of cancer immunotherapy has been to find the best overall balance between efficacy and side effects when mobilizing the body’s immune system to fight against cancer. The development of immune checkpoint inhibitors was a significant step forward, particularly with anti-PD-1 therapies, and brought with it impressive clinical activity in many different types of cancers, including melanoma, lung, head and neck and urothelial cancers. However, a literature review published in Science in 2018 noted that anti-PD-1 monotherapy response rates are only in the 15-25% range, and rise to ≥ 50% only in selected groups of patients with desmoplastic melanoma, Merkel carcinoma or tumors with mismatch-repair deficiency. Development of secondary resistance with disease progression is yet another common limitation of these therapies. Therefore, for most cancer patients, there is room for improvement. Checkpoint inhibitors can expand existing cancer fighting cells that may already be present in low numbers and support their activity against cancer cells, but if the right cancer-fighting cells are not present, checkpoint inhibitors may not provide clinical benefit. Similarly, there are many mechanisms of immune tolerance that are distinct from the checkpoints which may also be blocking the immune system from fighting cancer. Based on both pre-clinical and early clinical data, Advaxis believes that checkpoint inhibitors, when combined with treatments such as Lm Technology, can have an amplified anti-tumor effect. Lm Technology incorporates several complementary elements that include innate immune stimulation, potent generation of cancer-targeted T cells, ability to boost immunity through multiple treatments, enhancing lymphocyte infiltration into tumors, reduction of non-checkpoint mediated immune tolerance within the tumor microenvironment, and promotion of antigen spreading which may amplify the effects of treatment. These results provide rationale for further testing of Lm Technology agents alone and in combination with checkpoint inhibitors.
 
Traditional cancer vaccines were another development within immunotherapy and have a history beginning over 30 years ago. Unfortunately, these vaccines have largely been unsuccessful for a variety of potential reasons. These include poor selection of targets, imbalanced antigen presentation by inclusion of certain immune enhancing agents (adjuvants), failure to consider the blocking actions of immune tolerance, and choice of vaccine vectors. In some cases, patients may develop neutralizing antibodies, preventing further treatments. In contrast to traditional cancer vaccines, Lm Technology takes advantage of a natural pathway in the immune system that evolved to protect us against Listeria infections, that also happens to generate the same type of immunity that is required when fighting cancer. The live but weakened (attenuated) bacteria stimulate a balanced concert of innate immune triggers and present the tumor antigen target precisely where it needs to be able to generate potent cancer fighting cells from within the immune system itself. The multitude of accompanying signals serves to broadly mobilize most of the immune system in support of fighting what seems to be a Listeria infection, and is then “re-directed” against cancer cell targets. Additionally, the unique intracellular lifecycle of Listeria avoids the creation of neutralizing antibodies, thereby allowing for repeat administration as a chronic therapy with a sustained enhancing of tumor antigen-specific T cell immunity.
 
Looking back on the last two decades, there have been promising technology advancements to harness and activate killer T cells against cancers and every day more is learned about the interplay between immunity and cancer that can lead to improved treatments. However, there are still significant unmet needs in the immunotherapy landscape that Advaxis feels Lm Technology can address and complement. Specifically, Lm Technology has the potential to optimize and expand checkpoint inhibitor activity in combination. It also avoids many of the limitations of previous cancer vaccine attempts by tapping into the pathway reserved for defense against Listeria infection while incorporating the best cancer targets science can identify, including neoantigens that result from mutations in the cancer. To date, Lm Technology products have a manageable safety profile, do not generate neutralizing antibodies lending themselves to retreatments, and most of the products are designed to be immediately available for treatment without the complication and expense of modifying a patient’s own cells in a laboratory.

Lm Technology: An optimized Listeria -based antigen delivery system
 
Advaxis’ Listeria-based immunotherapies are designed for antigen delivery through a process of insertion of multiple copies of the proprietary tLLO -fusion protein into each extrachromosomal protein expression and secretion plasmid that makes and secretes the target protein right inside the patient’s antigen presenting cells to initiate and/or boost their immune response. The tLLO-fusion protein approach was developed at the University of Pennsylvania as an improvement over insertion of a single copy of the target gene, as an ACT-A (or other Lm peptide) fusion, within the bacterial genome for four key reasons:
 

1. | Multiple copies of the DNA in the plasmids per bacteria can result in larger amounts of tLLO-fusion protein being expressed simultaneously, versus a single copy. This is designed to improve antigen presentation and immunologic priming and increases the number of T cells generated for a particular treatment. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | tLLO expressed on plasmids (with or without a tumor target protein attached) has been shown preclinically to reduce numbers and immune suppressive function of Tregs and MDSCs in the tumor microenvironment. Presented preclinical data demonstrates that Tregs are destroyed as soon as five days after the first Lm Technology treatment and that suppressive M2 tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are replaced by M1 macrophages which support antigen presentation and adoptive immunity. 
3. | The extrachromosal DNA plasmids themselves also contain CPG sequence patterns that trigger TLR-9, which confers additional innate immune stimulation beyond a listeria without the plasmids. 
4. | The multiple copies of bacterial DNA plasmids (up to 80-100 per bacteria) confers additional stimulation of the STING receptor within APC’s which has been associated with enhancing anti-cancer immunity in patients. 

 
Through a license from the University of Pennsylvania, Advaxis has exclusive access to this proprietary formulation of attenuated Lm which further enhances what we believe to be a nearly ideal natural system. Clinical application in the Company’s four program areas is the core focus of current development efforts.
 
Clinical Pipeline
 
Advaxis is focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of proprietary Lm Technology antigen delivery products, with its latest stage program for cervical cancer in Phase 3 development. The Company and its collaborators are currently conducting or planning clinical studies of Lm Technology immunotherapies in four program areas:

● | Human Papilloma Virus (“HPV”)-associated cancers 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Personalized neoantigen-directed therapies 
● | Disease focused hotspot/‘off the shelf’ neoantigen-directed therapies 
● | Prostate cancer (ADXS-PSA) 



As a late-stage biotechnology company with no commercial products, Advaxis is aware of the need for fiscal responsibility, and is focusing its investment into the four program areas listed above. Additionally, the company will continue to be opportunistic by exploring ISTs, licensing and other external opportunities.

HPV-Related Cancers: Proof of Concept of Lm Technology
 
The Company is developing therapies for HPV-related cancers using axalimogene filolisbac (AXAL). Axalimogene filolisbac is an Lm–based antigen delivery product directed against HPV and designed to target cells expressing HPV. The company’s HPV-related products are currently under investigation, or being considered, in two HPV-associated cancers: cervical cancer and head and neck cancer, either as a monotherapy or in combination. Advaxis has also completed treatment in two Phase 2 studies of axalimogene filolisbac for the treatment of anal cancer and has decided to not pursue further studies in this cancer type at this time.
 
Cervical Cancer: axalimogene filolisbac
 
HPV is the most common viral infection of the reproductive tract and is the cause of a range of conditions in both females and males. In women, persistent infection with specific oncogenic types of HPV (most frequently alpha7 and alpha9 families) may lead to precancerous lesions which, if untreated, may progress to cervical cancer. There are approximately 527,000 new cases of cervical cancer caused by HPV worldwide every year, and 12,000 new cases in the U.S. alone, according to the World Health Organization (“WHO”) Human Papillomavirus and Related Cancers in the World Summary Report 2017. There are approximately 4,250 deaths from cervical cancer each year according to the National Institutes of Health. Current preventative HPV vaccines such as Gardasil® and Cervarix® cannot treat or protect the large population of adults already infected with the virus, leaving several generations of women vulnerable. Furthermore, challenges with acceptance, accessibility, and compliance have resulted in suboptimal vaccination rates, with approximately 50% of young women and 38% of young men being fully vaccinated in the United States, according to statistics published by the Centers for Disease Control in 2017. Vaccination rates are even lower in other countries around the world.
 
Axalimogene filolisbac has received FDA orphan drug designation for invasive International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (“FIGO”) Stage II-IV cervical cancer and has received Fast Track designation from the FDA for the treatment of high-risk locally advanced cervical cancer. Axalimogene filolisbac has also been classified as an advanced-therapy medicinal product (“ATMP”) for the treatment of cervical cancer by the European Medicines Agency’s (“EMA”) Committee for Advanced Therapies (“CAT”). The CAT is the EMA’s committee responsible for assessing the quality, safety and efficacy of ATMPs. The Company completed the CAT certification procedure and the CAT certified that the preclinical and quality information have met the scientific and technical standards for a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA).
 
Phase 2 Trial Results – axalimogene filolisbac
 
In 2014, the company completed a randomized Phase 2 clinical trial (Lm -LLO-E7-15) with AXAL +/- chemotherapy in 109 women, conducted in India, with recurrent/refractory cervical cancer. The final results were presented at the 2014 American Society of Clinical Oncology (“ASCO”) Annual Meeting and showed that 32% (35/109) of patients were alive at 12 months, 22% (24/109) of patients were Long-term Survivors (“LTS”) alive greater than 18 months, and 18% (16/91) evaluable with adequate follow-up of patients were alive for more than 24 months. Of the 109 patients treated in the trial, LTS included not only patients with tumor shrinkage but also patients who had experienced stable disease or increased tumor burden. 17% (19/109) of the patients in the trial had recurrence of disease after at least two prior treatments for their cervical cancer; these patients comprised 8% (2/24) of LTS. Among the LTS, 25% (3/12) of patients had a baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (“ECOG”) performance status of 2, a patient population that is often excluded from clinical trials. Furthermore, a 10% objective response rate (including 5 complete responses and 6 partial responses) and a disease control rate of 38% (42/109) were observed. The addition of cisplatin chemotherapy to axalimogene filolisbac in this trial did not significantly improve overall survival or objective tumor response (p =0.9981).
 
In this trial, 109 patients received 254 doses of axalimogene filolisbac. Axalimogene filolisbac was found to be well tolerated with 38% (41/109) of patients experiencing mild to moderate Grade 1 or 2 transient adverse events associated with infusion; 1 patient experienced a Grade 3 Serious Adverse Events (“SAE”). All observed treatment-related adverse events either self-resolved or responded readily to symptomatic treatment.
 
Based on these results, the Gynecological Oncology Group (“GOG”) Foundation, Inc. (now a member of NRG Oncology), under the sponsorship of the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (“CTEP”) of the National Cancer Institute (“NCI”), conducted GOG-0265, an open-label, single-arm Phase 2 trial of axalimogene filolisbac in persistent or recurrent cervical cancer (patients must have received at least 1 prior chemotherapy regimen for the treatment of their recurrent/metastatic disease, not including that administered as a component of primary treatment) at numerous clinical sites in the U.S. The trial was a Simon 2-stage design, with the primary efficacy endpoint being 12-month survival, with the objective of the secondary efficacy endpoints to evaluate progression-free survival, overall survival and objective tumor response. The primary safety endpoints were to evaluate the number of patients with dose-limiting toxicities and the frequency and severity of adverse effects.
 
To evaluate the trial’s primary endpoint of 12-month overall survival rate, the GOG’s protocol featured a prospectively-defined logistic model-based calculation of the expected 12-month survival rate using key predictive factors significantly related to survival and derived from 17 serially conducted GOG/NRG 2-stage studies of inactive agents in persistent/recurrent metastatic cervical cancer (“PRmCC”) involving approximately 500 patients. This accumulated data by GOG used a consistent protocol design and a similar data collection methodology resulting in a robust and homogeneous patient dataset for the per protocol analysis of the primary endpoint. Per the trial protocol, this logistic model-based calculation was then used as a comparator for evaluating the 12-month survival rate of axalimogene filolisbac observed in GOG-0265.

The first stage of enrollment in GOG-0265 was successfully completed with 26 patients treated and met the predetermined safety and efficacy criteria required to proceed into the second stage of patient enrollment. Clinical data from the first stage of GOG-0265 was presented at the American Gynecological & Obstetrical Society (“AGOS”) annual meeting in September 2015. Overall survival at 12 months was 38.5% (10/26) (the predefined criteria for 12-month survival in order to progress to Stage 2 was ≥20%), and, among patients who had received the full treatment regimen of 3 doses of axalimogene filolisbac, the 12-month survival rate was 55.6% (10/18). The adverse events observed in the first stage of the trial have been consistent with those reported in other clinical studies with axalimogene filolisbac.
 
Stage 2 of the trial began enrollment in February 2015 which included a protocol amendment to allow patients to continue to receive repeat cycles of therapy until disease progression. Stage 2 enrollment was temporarily suspended with a clinical hold in October 2015 that resolved in mid-December 2015. Prior to re-initiating enrollment of a new cohort of Stage 2 patients, Advaxis and the GOG Foundation/NRG Oncology examined the 12-month survival rate and safety data obtained from the 24 patients who had previously enrolled in Stage 2. The Stage 2 population demonstrated that treatment with axalimogene filolisbac resulted in a 37.5% (9/24) 12-month survival rate. This data was consistent with the findings in Stage 1 that showed a 38.5% 12-month survival rate, despite a greater proportion of Stage 2 patients having previously taken and failed bevacizumab treatment prior to enrollment. Taken together, the available data from both stages of GOG-0265 comprise a Phase 2 clinical trial in 50 subjects with a 12 month survival rate of 38% (19/50). The protocol defined logistic model-based calculation of the expected 12-month milestone survival rate was calculated to be 24.5% using the key predictors from the patients enrolled in the trial. The 12-month survival rate of 38% for patients receiving axalimogene filolisbac in the trial represented a 52% improvement over the expected 12-month milestone survival rate of 24.5%.
 
Overall, 28 out of 50 (56%) patients experienced a Grade 1 or Grade 2 treatment-related adverse event (TRAE) associated with axalimogene filolisbac infusion. The most common (>30%) Grade 1 or Grade 2 TRAEs were fatigue, chills, anemia, nausea and fever. Eighteen (36%) patients experienced a Grade 3 TRAE and two patients experienced a Grade 4 AE, including a Klebsiella lung infection in one patient, and hypotension/cytokine related symptoms in another patient, which were considered possibly related to treatment.
 
In October 2016, upon review of these findings, the Company announced early closure of GOG-0265. Results from the GOG-0265 trial were presented as an oral late-breaker presentation at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (“SGO”) annual meeting on March 14, 2017. Based on these data, the Company made a strategic decision to submit for conditional MAA in the European Union for axalimogene filolisbac to treat metastatic cervical cancer in patients who progress beyond first-line treatment in March 2018. However, Advaxis withdrew the application in July 2018 based on European Medicines Agency (EMA) feedback following its initial review indicating the application will likely need additional clinical data to support a conditional approval.
 
Advaxis also conducted a clinical trial with axalimogene filolisbac through a collaboration agreement with MedImmune, the global biologics research and development arm of AstraZeneca. This Phase 1/2, open-label, multicenter, dose determination and expansion cohort trial was designed to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (“RP2D”) and evaluate the safety and efficacy of axalimogene filolisbac, in combination with MedImmune’s investigational anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, IMFINZITM (“durvalumab”), as a treatment for patients with metastatic squamous or non-squamous carcinoma of the cervix and metastatic HPV-associated squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (“SCCHN”). The dose determination phase of the trial is complete. Two dose cohorts were enrolled. Cohort 1 enrolled 5 patients with metastatic cervical cancer who received 1 x 109 cfu of axalimogene filolisbac + 3 mg/mg durvalumab. Cohort 2 enrolled 3 patients with metastatic cervical cancer and 2 patients with SCCHN who received 1 x 109 cfu of axalimogene filolisbac + 10 mg/mg of durvalumab. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed in either cohort. The RP2D was determined to be 1 x 10 9 cfu for axalimogene filolisbac + 10 mg/mg for durvalumab. Preliminary data showed that two patients with metastatic cervical cancer achieved a durable complete response (with confirmation) and a partial response (without confirmation), respectively.
 
TRAEs were reported in 91% of patients; the majority were either Grade 1 (64%) or Grade 2 (55%) events. The most commonly reported TRAEs were chills, fever, nausea and hypotension. Three patients reported Grade 3 TRAEs (1 x 109 + 3 mg/kg - rigor/chills; 1 x 109 + 10 mg/kg - rigor/chills; and 1 x 109 + 10 mg/kg - diarrhea and shortness of breath). One patient experienced a Grade 4 TRAE of hypotension. As of February 27, 2018, the safety profile of the combination of axalimogene filolisbac and durvalumab was consistent with previous reported findings for both axalimogene filolisbac and durvalumab administered as monotherapy. However, on March 9, 2018, a clinical hold was issued for this study following submission by the Company of a safety report to the FDA regarding a patient death that occurred on February 27, 2018, post-dosing, involving acute respiratory failure after receiving nine months of combination therapy in the trial. New guidelines for the early detection and treatment of such rare events were agreed to with the FDA and were implemented in this and all other studies evaluating our Lm-based drug candidates. The clinical hold was lifted by FDA on July 12, 2018. Enrollment and dosing in all other Advaxis and durvalumab clinical programs were not affected by the clinical hold.

In November 2018, the Company announced that enrollment in the Part A expansion phase (N = 20 patients with SCCHN) and planned Part B expansion phase (N=90 patients with metastatic cervical cancer) had ended in order to maximize the efficient use of its resources. As of the latest internal data cut-off date of October 10, 2018, 7 patients receiving 1 x 10 9 axalimogene filolisbac + 10 mg/kg durvalumab had been enrolled. In the Part B expansion, a total of 32 patients with metastatic cervical cancer were randomized to receive either 10 mg/kg durvalumab alone (N=16 patients) or 1 x 10 9 axalimogene filolisbac + 10 mg/kg durvalumab (N = 16 patients) expansion phases.
 
Ongoing Registrational and Phase 3 Study: Axalimogene filolisbac
 
Women who are diagnosed with high risk, locally-advanced carcinoma of the cervix (“HRLACC”) face a higher chance that their cancer may recur following initial treatment when compared to earlier stages of the disease. When cervical cancer recurs, there are very few treatment options and the prognosis is dire. To address this unmet need, in 2016 the Company reached an agreement with the FDA, under its Special Protocol Assessment (“SPA”) process, for a Phase 3 trial evaluating axalimogene filolisbac in patients with HRLACC (“AIM2CERV” or “Advaxis Immunotherapy 2 Prevent Cervical Recurrence”) to be conducted in collaboration with the GOG/NRG Oncology.
 
AIM2CERV is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 trial of adjuvant axalimogene filolisbac following primary chemoradiation treatment of women with HRLACC. The primary objective of AIM2CERV is to compare the disease free survival of axalimogene filolisbac to placebo administered in the adjuvant setting following standard concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy (“CCRT”) administered with curative intent to patients with HRLACC. Secondary endpoints include examining overall survival and safety. The company’s goal is to develop a treatment to prevent or reduce the risk of cervical cancer recurrence after primary, standard of care treatment in women who are at high risk of recurrence. The current trial design has a planned sample size of 450 subjects to maintain adequate statistical power over a broader range of survival outcomes, as well as a pre-planned interim analysis (IA) of safety and efficacy. However, the Company has been evaluating the possibility of accelerating the IA timeline and establishing a more stringent futility boundary. The Company anticipates that in early 2019 it will finalize the redesign of the trial and review it with the FDA. During this time, the study is continuing to enroll patients under its current design, which is being conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment with the FDA.
 
HPV Program Licensing Agreements
 
Biocon Limited (“Biocon”), our co-development and commercialization partner for axalimogene filolisbac in India and key emerging markets, filed a Marketing Authorization Application (“MAA”) for licensure of this immunotherapy in India. The companies will evaluate next steps regarding potential registration in India.
 
Especificos Stendhal SA de CV (“Stendhal”), the Company’s co-development and commercialization partner for axalimogene filolisbac in Mexico, Brazil, Colombia and other Latin American countries, agreed to pay $10 million (“Support payment”) towards the expense of AIM2CERV over the duration of the trial, contingent upon Advaxis achieving annual project milestones, pursuant to a Co-Development and Commercialization Agreement (the “Stendhal Agreement”). The Company is currently in arbitration proceedings with Stendhal, see Legal Proceedings in Note 10 to the financial statements.
 
Knight Therapeutics Inc. (“Knight”), holds an exclusive license to commercialize axalimogene filolisbac in Canada, as well as other product candidates.
 
Advaxis granted Global BioPharma (“GBP”) an exclusive license for the development and commercialization of axalimogene filolisbac for the treatment of cervical cancer in Asia, Africa, and the former USSR territory, exclusive of India and certain other countries. GBP is responsible for all development and commercial costs and activities associated with the development in their territories.
 
Head and Neck Cancer
 
Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (“SCCHN”) is the most frequently occurring malignant tumor of the head and neck and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. More than 90% of SCCHNs originate from the mucosal linings of the oral cavity, pharynx, or larynx and 70% of these cancers are caused by HPV. According to the American Cancer Society, head and neck cancer accounts for about 3% of all cancers in the United States. But while the Pap smear and other HPV tests have reduced rates of cervical cancer, rates of oral cavity and pharynx cancer are growing, with 51,540 new cases projected to be diagnosed in the United Stated in 2018 according to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (“SEER”) database.
 
A study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that approximately 12% of U.S. men and 3% of women were actively infected with oral HPV between 2011 and 2014. That totals 11 million men and 3 million women who are at risk for developing SCCHN. SCCHN is typically asymptomatic until it has metastasized, and screening options do not exist. The only way to prevent infection is the HPV vaccine, but compliance has been low to date. Another challenge is that preventative vaccines cannot protect those already infected or older than 26, leaving several generations of Americans vulnerable to SCCHN with no way of knowing if cancer is silently growing.

We conducted a clinical trial in collaboration with MedImmune to collaborate on a Phase 1/2, open-label, multicenter, two part trial to evaluate safety and efficacy of axalimogene filolisbac, in combination with durvalumab (MEDI4736), for patients with metastatic squamous or non-squamous carcinoma of the cervix and metastatic HPV-associated SCCHN. Part 1 of this trial is complete and results will be presented in 2019. The Company and MedImmune have decided to not continue further enrollment into the expansion phases of this study.
 
The Company plans to initiate an investigator-sponsored trial with a major research center in head and neck cancer in early 2019. Axalimogene filolisbac has received FDA orphan drug designation for HPV-associated head and neck cancer.
 
Personalized Neoantigen-directed Therapies (ADXS-NEO)
 
Lm Technology is an effective vector for immunotherapy, and the Company made the decision to branch into the growing field of individualized cancer treatments with ADXS-NEO. ADXS-NEO is designed to create individualized therapies by activating the patient’s immune system to respond against multiple mutations, or neoantigens, identified from an individual patient’s tumor through DNA sequencing. In August 2016, Advaxis entered into a global agreement with Amgen for the development and commercialization of ADXS-NEO. On December 10, 2018, Company received a written notice of termination of such agreement from Amgen. See Note 9 to our financial statements. The termination is effective as of February 8, 2019. The Company’s ADXS-NEO study is currently enrolling patients and the Company will evaluate whether to re-partner the ADXS-NEO program.
 
ADXS-NEO is an individualized Lm Technology antigen delivery product developed using whole-exome sequencing of a patient’s tumor to identify neoantigens. ADXS-NEO is designed to work by presenting a large payload of neoantigens directly into dendritic cells within the patient’s immune system and stimulating a T cell response against cancerous cells.
 
The FDA allowed the IND application of ADXS-NEO. In June 2018, the Company announced the commencement of a Phase 1 trial with the dosing of the first patient with ADXS-NEO. ADXS-NEO is being evaluated in an open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter clinical trial in the United States. The study is open to patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), metastatic microsatellite stable colon cancer and metastatic squamous head and neck cancer. The study had been in development in collaboration with Amgen until December 2018, when Amgen provided the Company with a notice of termination of their existing collaboration. Advaxis will evaluate whether to re-partner the ADXS-NEO program. Advaxis anticipates providing safety, tolerability and immune correlative data from the first two cohorts in the first half of 2019.
 
The Company has entered into various research collaborations, including with the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, to advance the trial of neoepitope-based, personalized cancer therapy as part of the Tumor neoantigEn SeLection Alliance (“TESLA”) initiative.
 
Disease focused hotspot/‘off the shelf’ neoantigen therapies (ADXS-HOT)
 
Advaxis is creating a new group of immunotherapy constructs for major cancers that combines our optimized Lm Technology vector with promising targets to generate potent anti-cancer immunity. The ADXS-HOT program is a series of novel cancer immunotherapies that will target somatic mutations (“hotspots”), cancer testis antigens (“CTAs”) and oncofetal antigens (“OFAs”). These three types of targets form the basis of the ADXS-HOT program because they are designed to be more capable of generating potent, tumor specific, and high strength killer T cells, versus more traditional over-expressed native sequence TAAs. Most hotspot mutations and OFA/CTA proteins play critical roles in oncogenesis; targeting both at once could significantly impair cancer proliferation. The ADXS-HOT products will combine many of the potential high avidity targets that are expressed in all patients with the target disease into one “off-the-shelf”, ready to administer treatment. The ADXS-HOT technology has a strong Intellectual Property (“IP”) position, with potential protection into 2037, and an IP filing strategy providing for broad coverage opportunities across multiple disease platforms and combination therapies.
 
In July 2018, the Company announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allowed the Company’s IND application for its ADXS-HOT drug candidate for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Advaxis plans to have the first subject enrolled in this Phase 1/2 study in early 2019 with an anticipated readout of safety, tolerability and immune correlative data from the first cohort in the first half of 2019. Advaxis plans to file additional ADXS-HOT INDs in 2019, in prostate and bladder cancers.
 
Prostate Cancer (ADXS-PSA)
 
According to the American Cancer Society, prostate cancer is the second most common type of cancer found in American men and is the second leading cause of cancer death in men, behind only lung cancer. More than 160,000 men are estimated to be diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2018, with approximately 30,000 deaths each year. Unfortunately, in about 10 – 20% of cases, men with prostate cancer will go on to develop castration-resistant prostate cancer (“CRPC”), which refers to prostate cancer that progresses despite androgen deprivation therapy. Metastatic CRPC (“mCRPC”) occurs when the cancer spreads to other parts of the body and there is a rising prostate-specific antigen (“PSA”) level. This stage of prostate cancer has an average survival of 9-13 months, is associated with deterioration in quality of life, and has few therapeutic options available.

According to a data review published by MD Anderson Cancer Center in 2016, checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy has not shown significant activity in mCRPC to date. The authors hypothesize that may be due to the inability of the checkpoint inhibitor to infiltrate the tumor microenvironment, and that combination therapy with agents that induce T cell infiltration within the tumor may improve performance of checkpoints in prostate cancer. Recent data from the Keynote-199 trial in bone predominant-mCRCP patients treated with KEYTRUDA® (“pembrolizumab”) was presented at the 2018 ASCO Annual Meeting. In this trial, only 4 out of 60 patients (7%) had decrease PSA post-baseline, with only 1 case that was ≥50%. The total SD/disease stabilization rate was 37%.
 
Lm Technology constructs have been shown by multiple labs to reduce number and suppressive function of Tregs and MDSCs in the tumor microenvironment and cause the destruction of Tregs in the TME as soon as five days after dosing in models. This reduction of immune suppression in the tumors has been attributed to our proprietary tLLO -fusion peptides expressed by multiple copies of the plasmids in each bacteria. Advaxis feels that the combination of ADXS-PSA, our immunotherapy designed to target the PSA antigen, with a checkpoint inhibitor may provide an alternative treatment option for patients with mCRPC. Clinical benefit in prostate cancer could be a significant value creator to expand the Lm Technology platform into the prostate cancer market.
 
Advaxis has entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Merck to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ADXS-PSA as monotherapy and in combination with KEYTRUDA® (“pembrolizumab”), Merck’s anti PD-1 antibody, in a Phase 1/2, open-label, multicenter, dose determination and expansion trial in patients with previously treated metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (Keynote-046). ADXS-PSA was tested alone or in combination with KEYTRUDA in an advanced and heavily pretreated patient population who had progressed on androgen deprivation therapy. A total of 13 and 37 patients were evaluated on monotherapy and combination therapy, respectively. For the ADXS-PSA monotherapy dose escalation and determination portion of the trial, cohorts were started at a dose of 1 x 109 cfu (n=7) and successfully escalated to higher dose levels of 5x109 cfu (n=3) and 1x1010 cfu (n=3) without achieving a maximum tolerated dose. Treatment emergent adverse events noted at these higher dose levels were generally consistent with those observed at the lower dose level (1 x 109 cfu) other than a higher occurrence rate of Grade 2/3 hypotension. The ADXS-PSA monotherapy dose-determination phase of the trial has been completed. The Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) of ADXS-PSA monotherapy was determined to be 1x 109 cfu based on a review of the totality of the clinical data. This dose was used in combination with 200mg of pembrolizumab in a cohort of six patients to evaluate the safety of the combination before moving into an expanded cohort of patients. The safety of the combination was confirmed and enrollment in the expansion cohort phase was initiated. Enrollment in this phase of the trial (n = 37) was completed in January 2017.
 
Updated data of this study in mCRPC patients treated with ADXS-PSA monotherapy (Part A) and in combination with pembrolizumab (Part B) were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in June 2018. At entry, Part A and Part B patients were similar in age (~70 yrs), Gleason score (~8.3), absence of visceral metastases (71% vs. 70%) and prior abiraterone use. Part B patients had higher median baseline PSA values (40.6 vs. 20.8 ng/ml), and more prior enzalutamide (53% vs. 26%) and chemotherapy (49% vs. 36%) use versus Part A patients. A total of 49 patients (98%) experienced treatment-related adverse events (TRAE), mainly chills, fever, nausea and hypotension. Five Part A and 13 Part B patients had grade 3-4 events: fatigue, hypotension, hypertension, anemia. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were mostly mild or moderate constitutional symptoms such as fever, chills, rigors, hypotension, nausea and fatigue, consistent with immune activation and manageable with standard care. One patient in the monotherapy arm was discontinued from the study due to a grade 4 TRAE related to cytokine release, which resolved within 24 hours using medical management. Overall, two Part A (14%) v 16 Part B patients (43%) had a decreased PSA post-baseline. Of these, seven Part B (22%) versus 0 Part A patients achieved a PSA reduction ≥50% from baseline. Part B patients had higher rates (56.8%) of stable disease/disease stabilization than Part A patients (38.5%). Part B patients had higher rates (27%) of stable disease than monotherapy patients (7.7%). In all treated patients, an improvement in survival was observed in Part B patients with ≥ 50% PSA declines from baseline versus those with < 50% PSA declines. In conclusion, in this population of heavily pretreated mCRPC pts, ADXS-PSA + pembrolizumab had a manageable safety profile (mostly grade 1-2 TRAEs) and showed a greater level of activity compared to monotherapy. The Company anticipates providing an update on this study during the first quarter of 2019.
 
Other Lm Technology Products
 
HER2 Expressing Solid Tumors
 
HER2 is overexpressed in a percentage of solid tumors including osteosarcoma. According to published literature, up to 60% of osteosarcomas are HER2 positive, and this overexpression is associated with poor outcomes for patients. ADXS-HER2 is an Lm Technology antigen delivery product candidate designed to target HER2 expressing solid tumors including human and canine osteosarcoma. ADXS-HER2 has received FDA and EMA orphan drug designation for osteosarcoma and has received Fast Track designation from the FDA for patients with newly-diagnosed, non-metastatic, surgically-resectable osteosarcoma.
 
In September 2018, the Company announced that it had granted a license to OS Therapies, LLC (“OS Therapies”) for the use of ADXS31-164, also known as ADXS-HER2, for evaluation in the treatment of osteosarcoma in humans. Under the terms of the license agreement, OS Therapies, in collaboration with the Children’s Oncology Group (COG), will be responsible for the conduct and funding of a clinical study evaluating ADXS-HER2 in recurrent, completely resected osteosarcoma. Pursuant to the agreement, Advaxis is to receive an upfront payment, reimbursement for product supply and other support, clinical, regulatory, and sales-based milestone payments, and royalties on future product sales. Additional details of the financial terms have not been disclosed.

Canine Osteosarcoma
 
On March 19, 2014, we entered into a definitive Exclusive License Agreement (the “Aratana Agreement”) with Aratana Therapeutics, Inc. (“Aratana”), where we granted Aratana an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license, with the right to sublicense, certain of our proprietary technology that enables Aratana to develop and commercialize animal health products that will be targeted for treatment of osteosarcoma and other cancer indications in animals. A product license request was filed by Aratana for ADXS-HER2 (also known as AT-014 by Aratana) for the treatment of canine osteosarcoma with the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”). Aratana received communication in December 2017 that the USDA granted Aratana conditional licensure for AT-014 for the treatment of dogs diagnosed with osteosarcoma, one year of age or older. Initially, Aratana plans to make the therapeutic available for purchase at approximately two dozen veterinary oncology practice groups across the United States who participate in the study. Aratana received communication in December 2017 that the USDA granted Aratana conditional licensure for AT-014 for the treatment of dogs diagnosed with osteosarcoma, one year of age or older. Aratana is currently conducting an extended field study which is a requirement for full USDA licensure. Initially, Aratana plans to make the therapeutic available for purchase at approximately two dozen veterinary oncology practice groups across the United States who participate in the study.
 
Under the terms of the Aratana Agreement, Aratana paid an upfront payment to Advaxis in the amount of $1,000,000 upon signing of the Aratana Agreement. Aratana will also pay Advaxis: (a) up to $36.5 million based on the achievement of milestone relating to the advancement of products through the approval process with the USDA in the United States and the relevant regulatory authorities in the European Union (“E.U.”) in all four therapeutic areas and up to an additional $15 million in cumulative sales milestones based on achievement of gross sales revenue targets for sales of any and all products for use in non-human animal health applications (the “Aratana Field”) (regardless of therapeutic area), and (b) tiered royalties starting at 5% and going up to 10%, which will be paid based on net sales of any and all products (regardless of therapeutic area) in the Aratana Field in the United States. Royalties for sales of products outside of the United States will be paid at a rate equal to half of the royalty rate payable by Aratana on net sales of products in the United States (starting at 2.5% and going up to 5%). Royalties will be payable on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis from first commercial sale of a product in a country until the later of (a) the 10th anniversary of first commercial sale of such product by Aratana, its affiliates or sub licensees in such country or (b) the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim of our patents or joint patents claiming or covering the composition of matter, formulation or method of use of such product in such country. Aratana will also pay us 50% of all sublicense royalties received by Aratana and its affiliates. In fiscal year 2018, the Company received approximately $5,000 in royalty revenue from Aratana.
 
Corporate Information
 
We were originally incorporated in the State of Colorado on June 5, 1987 under the name Great Expectations, Inc. We were a publicly-traded “shell” company without any business until November 12, 2004 when we acquired Advaxis, Inc., a Delaware corporation, through a Share Exchange and Reorganization Agreement, dated as of August 25, 2004, which we refer to as the Share Exchange, by and among Advaxis, the stockholders of Advaxis and us. As a result of the Share Exchange, Advaxis became our wholly-owned subsidiary and our sole operating company. On December 23, 2004, we amended and restated our articles of incorporation and changed our name to Advaxis, Inc. On June 6, 2006, our stockholders approved the reincorporation of our company from Colorado to Delaware by merging the Colorado entity into our wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary. Our date of inception, for financial statement purposes, is March 1, 2002 and the Company was uplisted to NASDAQ in 2014.

Intellectual Property
 
Protection of our intellectual property is important to our business. We have a robust and extensive patent portfolio that protects our product candidates and Lm -based immunotherapy technology. Currently, we own or have rights to over 400 patents and applications, which are owned, licensed from, or co-owned with University of Pennsylvania (“Penn”), Merck, National Institute of Health (“NIH”), and/or Augusta University. We continuously grow this portfolio by filing new applications to protect our ongoing research and development efforts. We aggressively prosecute and defend our patents and proprietary technology. Our patents and applications are directed to the compositions of matter, use, and methods thereof, of our Lm -LLO immunotherapies for our product candidates, including axalimogene filolisbac, ADXS-PSA, ADXS-NEO, ADXS-HOT, ADXS-HER2.

Our approach to the intellectual property portfolio is to create, maintain, protect, enforce and defend our proprietary rights for the products we develop from our immunotherapy technology platform. We endeavor to maintain a coherent and aggressive strategic approach to building our patent portfolio with an emphasis in the field of cancer vaccines. Issued patents which are directed to axalimogene filolisbac, ADXS-PSA, and ADXS-HER2 in the United States, will expire between 2017 and 2032. Issued patents directed to our product candidates axalimogene filolisbac, ADXS-PSA, and ADXS-HER2 outside of the United States, will expire in 2032. Issued patents directed to our Lm -based immunotherapy platform in the United States, will expire between 2017 and 2031. Issued patents directed to our Lm -based immunotherapy platform outside of the United States, will expire between 2018 and 2033.
 
We have pending patent applications directed to our product candidates axalimogene filolisbac, ADXS-PSA, ADXS-HER2, ADXS-NEO and ADXS-HOT that, if issued would expire in the United States and in countries outside of the United States between 2020 and 2037. We have pending patent applications directed to methods of using of our product candidates axalimogene filolisbac, ADXS-DUAL, ADXS-PSA, ADXS-NEO, ADXS-HOT, ADXS-HER2 directed to the following indications and others: HPV-related cervical cancer, prostate cancer and her2/neu-expressing cancer, that, if issued would expire in the United States and in countries outside of the United States between 2020 and 2037, depending on the specific indications.
 
We will be able to protect our technology from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent it is covered by valid and enforceable patents or is effectively maintained as trade secrets. Patents and other proprietary rights are an essential element of our business.
 
Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, technology, and know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
 
Any patent applications which we have filed or will file or to which we have or will have license rights may not issue, and patents that do issue may not contain commercially valuable claims. In addition, any patents issued to us or our licensors may not afford meaningful protection for our products or technology, or may be subsequently circumvented, invalidated, narrowed, or found unenforceable. Our processes and potential products may also conflict with patents which have been or may be granted to competitors, academic institutions or others. As the pharmaceutical industry expands and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our processes and potential products may give rise to interferences filed by others in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or to claims of patent infringement by other companies, institutions or individuals. These entities or persons could bring legal actions against us claiming damages and seeking to enjoin clinical testing, manufacturing and marketing of the related product or process. In recent years, several companies have been extremely aggressive in challenging patents covering pharmaceutical products, and the challenges have often been successful. If any of these actions are successful, in addition to any potential liability for damages, we could be required to cease the infringing activity or obtain a license in order to continue to manufacture or market the relevant product or process. We may not prevail in any such action and any license required under any such patent may not be made available on acceptable terms, if at all. Our failure to successfully defend a patent challenge or to obtain a license to any technology that we may require to commercialize our technologies or potential products could have a materially adverse effect on our business. In addition, changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may materially diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection.
 
We also rely upon unpatented proprietary technology, and in the future may determine in some cases that our interests would be better served by reliance on trade secrets or confidentiality agreements rather than patents or licenses. We may not be able to protect our rights to such unpatented proprietary technology and others may independently develop substantially equivalent technologies. If we are unable to obtain strong proprietary rights to our processes or products after obtaining regulatory clearance, competitors may be able to market competing processes and products.
 
Others may obtain patents having claims which cover aspects of our products or processes which are necessary for, or useful to, the development, use or manufacture of our services or products. Should any other group obtain patent protection with respect to our discoveries, our commercialization of potential therapeutic products and methods could be limited or prohibited.
 
The Drug Development Process
 
The product candidates in our pipeline are at various stages of preclinical and clinical development. The path to regulatory approval includes multiple phases of clinical trials in which we collect data that will ultimately support an application to regulatory authorities to allow us to market a product for the treatment, of a specific type of cancer. There are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in research and development of new products, resulting in high costs and variable success rates. Bringing a drug from discovery to regulatory approval, and ultimately to market, takes many years and significant costs.

Clinical testing, known as clinical trials or clinical studies, is either conducted internally by pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies or is managed on behalf of these companies by Clinical Research Organizations (“CRO”). The process of conducting clinical studies is highly regulated by the FDA, as well as by other governmental and professional bodies. In a clinical trial, participants receive specific interventions according to the research plan or protocol created by the study sponsor and implemented by study investigators. Clinical trials may compare a new medical approach to a standard one that is already available or to a placebo that contains no active ingredients or to no intervention. Some clinical trials compare interventions that are already available to each other. When a new product or approach is being studied, it is not usually known whether it will be helpful, harmful, or no different than available alternatives. The investigators try to determine the safety and efficacy of the intervention by measuring certain clinical outcomes in the participants.
 
Phase 1. Phase 1 clinical trials begin when regulatory agencies allow initiation of clinical investigation of a new drug or product candidate. They typically involve testing an investigational new drug on a limited number of patients. Phase 1 studies determine a drug’s basic safety, maximum tolerated dose and how the drug is absorbed by, and eliminated from, the body. Typically, cancer therapies are initially tested on late-stage cancer patients.
 
Phase 2. Phase 2 clinical trials involve larger numbers of patients that have been diagnosed with the targeted disease or condition. Phase 2 clinical trials gather preliminary data on effectiveness (where the drug works in people who have a certain disease or condition) and to determine the common short-term side effects and risks associated with the drug. If Phase 2 clinical trials show that an investigational new drug has an acceptable range of safety risks and probable effectiveness, a company will continue to evaluate the investigational new drug in Phase 3 studies.
 
Phase 3. Phase 3 clinical trials are typically controlled multi-center trials that involve a larger number of patients to ensure the study results are statistically significant. The purpose is to confirm effectiveness and safety on a large scale and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. These trials are generally global in nature and are designed to generate clinical data necessary to submit an application for marketing approval to regulatory agencies.
 
Biologic License Application (BLA). The results of the clinical trials using biologics are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA. Following the completion of Phase 3 studies, if the sponsor of a potential product in the United States believes it has sufficient information to support the safety and effectiveness of the investigational new drug, the sponsor submits a BLA to the FDA requesting that the investigational new drug be approved for marketing. The application is a comprehensive filing that includes the results of all preclinical and clinical studies, information about the drug’s composition, and the sponsor’s plans for manufacturing, packaging, labeling and testing the investigational new drug. The FDA’s review of an application is designated either as a standard review with a target review time of 10 months or a priority review with a target of 6 months. Depending upon the completeness of the application and the number and complexity of follow-up requests and responses between the FDA and the sponsor, the review time can take months to many years. Once approved through this process, a drug may be marketed in the United States, subject to any conditions imposed by the FDA.
 
Government Regulations
 
General
 
Government authorities in the United States and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the preclinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export, marketing and distribution of drugs. In the United States, the FDA subjects drugs to rigorous review under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act and other federal statutes and regulations.
Orphan Drug Designation
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act (“ODA”), the FDA may grant Orphan Drug Designation (“ODD”) to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which means a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, but for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States will be recovered from domestic sales of the product.
 
The benefits of ODD can be substantial, including research and development tax credits and exemption from user fees, enhanced access to advice from the FDA while the drug is being developed, and market exclusivity once the product reaches approval and begins sales, provided that the new product is first to market and that this new product has not been previously approved for the same orphan disease or condition, with or without orphan drug designation. In order to qualify for these incentives, a company must apply for designation of its product as an “Orphan Drug” and obtain approval from the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process; however, an ODD product may be eligible for priority review. A drug that is approved for the ODD indication is granted seven years of orphan drug exclusivity. During that period, the FDA generally may not approve any other application for the same product for the same indication, although there are exceptions, most notably when the later product is shown to be clinically superior to the product with exclusivity.

We currently have ODD with the FDA for axalimogene filolisbac for treatment of anal cancer (granted August 2013), HPV-associated head and neck cancer (granted November 2013); and treatment of Stage II-IV invasive cervical cancer (granted May 2014). We also have ODD with the FDA for ADXS-HER2 for the treatment of osteosarcoma (granted May 2014).
 
In Europe, the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (“COMP”) issued a positive opinion on the application for ODD of axalimogene filolisbac for the treatment of anal cancer (December 2015) and on the application for ODD of ADXS-HER2 for osteosarcoma (November 2015).
 
Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions
 
Four core FDA programs are intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical need in the treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions: fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval, and priority review. We intend to avail ourselves of any and all of these programs as applicable to our products.
 
Non-U.S. Regulation
 
Before our products can be marketed outside the United States, they are subject to regulatory approval of the respective authorities in the country in which the product should be marketed. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. No action can be taken to market any product in a country until an appropriate application has been approved by the regulatory authorities in that country. The time spent in gaining approval varies from that required for FDA approval, and in certain countries, the sales price of a product must also be approved. The pricing review period often begins after market approval is granted. Even if a product is approved by a regulatory authority, satisfactory prices might not be approved for such product.
 
Collaborations, Partnerships and Agreements
 
Collaborations, partnerships and agreements are a key component of Advaxis’ corporate strategy. As a late stage biotechnology company without sales revenue, partnerships are an essential part of the ongoing strategy. Additionally, the evolution of the field of immunotherapy has resulted in combination treatments becoming ubiquitous; ongoing clinical studies and agreements with many of the leading, large oncology pharmaceutical companies helps validate that Lm Technology may play a key role in the cancer treatment protocols of the future.
 
Our collaborators and partners include Merck, Aratana, OS Therapies, Biocon, Global BioPharma, Knight, and others. For more information, see Note 9 to our financial statements.
 
We entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with Penn, on July 1, 2002 with respect to the innovative work of Yvonne Paterson, Ph.D., Associate Dean for Research at the School of Nursing at Penn, and former Professor of Microbiology at Penn, in the area of innate immunity, or the immune response attributed to immune cells, including dendritic cells, macrophages and natural killer cells, that respond to pathogens non-specifically (subject to certain U.S. government rights). This agreement was amended and restated as of February 13, 2007, and, thereafter, has been amended from time to time.
 
This license, unless sooner terminated in accordance with its terms, terminates upon the latter of (a) the expiration of the last to expire of the Penn patent rights; or (b) twenty years after the effective date of the license. Penn may terminate the license agreement early upon the occurrence of certain defaults by us, including, but not limited to, a material breach by us of the Penn license agreement that is not cured within 60 days after notice of the breach is provided to us.
 
The license provides us with the exclusive commercial rights to the patent portfolio developed by Penn as of the effective date of the license, in connection with Dr. Paterson and requires us to pay various milestone, legal, filing and licensing payments to commercialize the technology. In exchange for the license, Penn received shares of our Common Stock. However, as of October 31, 2016, Penn does not own shares of our Common Stock. In addition, Penn is entitled to receive a non-refundable initial license fee, royalty payments and milestone payments based on net sales and percentages of sublicense fees and certain commercial milestones. Under the amended licensing agreement, Penn is entitled to receive 2.5% of net sales in the territory. Should annual net sales exceed $250 million, the royalty rate will increase to 2.75%, but only with respect to those annual net sales in excess of $250 million. Additionally, Penn will receive tiered sales milestone payments upon the achievement of cumulative global sales ranging between $250 million and $2 billion, with the maximum aggregate amounts payable to Penn in the event that maximum sales milestones are achieved is $40 million. Notwithstanding these royalty rates, upon first in-human commercial sale (U.S. & E.U.), we have agreed to pay Penn a total of $775,000 over a four-year period as an advance minimum royalty, which shall serve as an advance royalty in conjunction with the above terms. In addition, under the license, we are obligated to pay an annual maintenance fee of $100,000 commencing on December 31, 2010, and each December 31st thereafter for the remainder of the term of the agreement until the first commercial sale of a Penn licensed product. We are responsible for filing new patents and maintaining and defending the existing patents licensed to us and we are obligated to reimburse Penn for all attorney’s fees, expenses, official fees and other charges incurred in the preparation, prosecution and maintenance of the patents licensed from Penn.

Upon first regulatory approval in humans (US or EU), Penn will be entitled to a milestone payment of $600,000. Furthermore, upon the achievement of the first sale of a product in certain fields, Penn will be entitled to certain milestone payments, as follows: $2.5 million will be due upon the first in-human commercial sale (US or EU) of the first product in the cancer field and $1.0 million will be due upon the date of first in-human commercial sale (US or EU) of a product in each of the secondary strategic fields sold.
 
Manufacturing
 
Current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMPs”) are the standards identified to conform to requirements by governmental agencies that control authorization and licensure for manufacture and distribution of drug products for either clinical investigations or commercial sale. GMPs identify the requirements for procurement, manufacturing, testing, storage, distribution and the supporting quality systems to ensure that a drug product is safe for its intended application. cGMPs are enforced in the United States by the FDA, under the authorities of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations and use the phrase “current good manufacturing practices” (“cGMP”) to describe these standards.
 
Each of Advaxis’ wholly owned product candidates is manufactured using a platform process, with uniform methods and testing procedures. This allows for an accelerated pathway from construct discovery to clinical product delivery, while helping to keep cost of goods low. The Company intends to add new constructs to this standardized manufacturing process as its pipeline evolves.
 
Advaxis has entered into agreements with multiple third-party organizations (“CMOs”) to handle the manufacturing, testing, and distribution of product candidates. These organizations have extensive experience within the biologics space and with the production of clinical and commercial GMP supplies.
 
In parallel, the Company has also continued to invest in internal process/analytical development, quality systems, manufacturing, and quality control infrastructure with the goal of accelerating and advancing our pipeline. Advaxis has constructed a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility and laboratory to develop and manufacture clinical-grade products, supporting the clinical trials and future commercialization of the Company’s therapeutics. Increased manufacturing capability and capacity allows Advaxis to manufacture its own material and reduce reliance on CMOs, and improve supply flexibility, scalability, lead times, and costs of goods. The Company’s long-term manufacturing strategy is to leverage both their partners’ capabilities and their internal capabilities in order to build a supply chain that is reliable, flexible, and cost competitive.
 
Competition
 
The biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid technological developments and a high degree of competition. As a result, our actual or proposed immunotherapies could become obsolete before we recoup any portion of our related research and development expenses. While we believe that our product candidates, technology, knowledge and experience provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from established and emerging pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, among others. The biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are highly competitive, and this competition comes from both biotechnology firms and from major pharmaceutical companies, including: Aduro, BioNtech, Moderna, Gritstone, BMS, Inovio Pharmaceutical Inc., ISA Pharmaceuticals, AstraZeneca, Merck, Neon Therapeutics, Oncolytics Biotech Inc., Oncothyreon Inc., et al., each of which is pursuing cancer vaccines and/or immunotherapies.
 
Many of these companies have substantially greater financial, marketing, and human resources than we do (including, in some cases, substantially greater experience in clinical testing, manufacturing, and marketing of pharmaceutical products). We also experience competition in the development of our immunotherapies from universities and other research institutions and compete with others in acquiring technology from such universities and institutions. In addition, certain of our immunotherapies may be subject to competition from investigational new drugs and/or products developed using other technologies, some of which have completed numerous clinical trials.
 
Our competition will be determined in part by the potential indications for which drugs are developed and ultimately approved by regulatory authorities. Additionally, the timing of market introduction of some of our potential immunotherapies or of competitors’ products may be an important competitive factor. Accordingly, the speed with which we can develop immunotherapies, complete preclinical testing, clinical trials and approval processes and supply commercial quantities to market are expected to be important competitive factors. We expect that competition among products approved for sale will be based on various factors, including product efficacy, safety, administration, reliability, acceptance, availability, price and patent position.
