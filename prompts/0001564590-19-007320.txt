Item 1. Business. 
General
 InPoint Commercial Real Estate Income, Inc. (which we refer to herein as the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is  a Maryland corporation formed in September 2016 to originate, acquire and manage a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate (“CRE”) investments primarily comprised of (i) CRE debt, that are primarily floating rate, including first mortgage loans, subordinate mortgage and mezzanine loans, and participations in such loans and (ii) CRE securities, such as commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”) that primarily will be floating rate and senior unsecured debt of publicly traded real estate investment trusts (“REITs”). We may also invest in select equity investments in single-tenant, net leased properties. Substantially all of our business is conducted through our operating partnership, InPoint REIT Operating Partnership, LP (the “Operating Partnership”), of which we are the sole general partner.  We are externally managed by Inland InPoint Advisor, LLC (the “Advisor”), an indirect subsidiary of Inland Real Estate Investment Corporation (“IREIC”), which is a member of The Inland Real Estate Group of Companies, Inc. (“Inland”). The Advisor has engaged SPCRE InPoint Advisors, LLC (the “Sub-Advisor”), a subsidiary of Sound Point CRE Management, LP (“Sound Point”), to perform certain services on behalf of the Advisor for us. We have elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We are not a mutual fund and do not intend to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”).
 We are conducting a private offering that commenced on October 25, 2016 (the “Offering”) of up to $500 million in our Class P shares of common stock (the “Class P Shares”) pursuant to a private placement memorandum. The purchase price per Class P Share in the Offering currently equals $25.00 (the “Transaction Price”) plus applicable selling commissions, dealer manager fees and organization and offering expenses, resulting in a total purchase price of $27.38 per Class P Share if maximum selling commissions, dealer manager fees and organization and offering expenses are paid. Inland Securities Corporation (the “Dealer Manager”), an affiliate of the Advisor, is the dealer manager for the Offering. 
 We intend to determine our net asset value (“NAV”) no later than November 16, 2019, which is the third anniversary of the first sale of Class P Shares in the Offering, unless our board of directors determines to cause such calculation to be performed earlier. We refer to the date upon which our NAV is first determined as the “NAV Pricing Date.” Commencing with the NAV Pricing Date, the Advisor will be responsible for calculating our NAV and our NAV per share for each class of common stock at the end of each calendar month. 
 As of March 11, 2019, we had received and accepted investors’ subscriptions for and issued 7,199,491 Class P Shares in the Offering, resulting in gross proceeds of $194,268. As of March 11, 2019, $305,777 of Class P Shares remained to be sold in the Offering.
 Investment Portfolio
 Our objective is to originate, acquire and manage an investment portfolio of CRE debt and CRE securities that is diversified based on the type and location of collateral securing the underlying CRE debt and CRE securities.  We intend that the real estate underlying our CRE debt and CRE securities investments as well CRE equity investments we may make, will be located within the United States and diversified by property type, geographic location, owner/operator and tenant. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, our investment portfolio consisted of $249.6 million and $32.1 million, respectively, in commercial mortgage loans held for investment and $91.2 million and $26.0 million, respectively, in CMBS.  
Competition
 Our net income depends, in large part, on our ability to originate loans and acquire assets at favorable spreads over our borrowing costs. In acquiring our investments, we compete with other REITs, specialty finance companies, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, financial institutions, governmental bodies and other entities.  Many of our competitors are significantly larger than we are, have access to greater capital and other resources and may have other advantages over us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than we can. Market conditions may attract more competitors, which may increase the competition for sources of financing. An increase in the competition for sources of financing could adversely affect the availability and cost of financing.

We rely on the Sub-Advisor’s professionals and their industry expertise, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage. These professionals help us assess investment risks and determine appropriate pricing for our mortgage loans and potential investments. Their industry relationships enable us to compete more effectively for attractive investment opportunities. Despite certain competitive advantages, we may not be able to achieve our business goals or expectations due to the competitive risks that we face. We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities and competition may limit our ability to acquire desirable investments in our target assets and could also affect the pricing of these investments.
 Employees
 We do not have any employees. All of our executive officers are officers of the Advisor, the Sub-Advisor or one or more of their affiliates and are compensated by those entities, in part, for their services rendered to us. We neither separately compensate our executive officers for their service as officers, nor do we reimburse either the Advisor or the Sub-Advisor for any compensation paid to individuals who also serve as our executive officers.
Tax Status
 We believe we have operated, and we intend to continue to operate in a manner that will allow us to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with the taxable year ending December 31, 2017. Accordingly, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income to the extent that we annually distribute all of our net taxable income to our stockholders and maintain our qualification as a REIT.
