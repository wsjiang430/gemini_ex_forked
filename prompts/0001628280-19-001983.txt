ITEM 1. Business
The Company
     We are the world’s largest owner and operator of temperature-controlled warehouses. We are the only publicly traded REIT focused on the temperature-controlled warehouse industry. We are organized as a self-administered and self-managed REIT with proven operating, development and acquisition expertise. As of December 31, 2018, we operated a global network of 155 temperature-controlled warehouses encompassing 918.7 million cubic feet, with 137 warehouses in the United States, six warehouses in Australia, seven warehouses in New Zealand, two warehouses in Argentina and three warehouses in Canada. We view and manage our business through three primary business segments: warehouse, third-party managed and transportation. In addition, we hold a minority interest in a joint venture through our operating partnership, as described in Note 3 of our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which owns or operates 12 temperature-controlled warehouses located in the People's Republic of China (or the China JV). 
We consider our temperature-controlled warehouses to be “mission-critical” real estate in the markets we serve from “farm to fork” and an integral component of the temperature-controlled food infrastructure supply chain, which we refer to as the “cold chain.” The cold chain is vital for maintaining the quality of food producers’, distributors’, retailers’ and e-tailers’ temperature-sensitive products, protecting brand reputation and ensuring consumer safety and satisfaction. Our customers depend upon the location, high-quality, integration and scale of our portfolio to ensure the integrity and efficient distribution of their products. Many of our warehouses are located in key logistics corridors in the countries in which we operate, including strategically critical U.S. and international metropolitan statistical areas, or MSAs, while others are connected or immediately adjacent to customers’ production facilities. We believe our strategic locations and the extensive geographic presence of our integrated warehouse network are fundamental to our customers’ ability to optimize their distribution networks while reducing their capital expenditures, operating costs and supply-chain risks. Many of the warehouses in our real estate portfolio have been modernized to reduce our power costs and increase their competitive position through reliable temperature-control systems and processes.
We consider ownership of our temperature-controlled warehouses to be fundamental to our business, our ability to attract and retain customers and our ability to achieve our targeted return on invested capital. We believe that the ownership of our real estate provides us with cost of capital and balance sheet advantages, stemming from the attractive financing options available to real estate owners and the tax advantages of being a REIT. We also believe that consolidation of the ownership and operation of our portfolio significantly enhances the value of our business by allowing us to provide customers with our complementary suite of value-added services across one integrated and reliable cold chain network. Ownership of our integrated cold chain network enhances our ability to efficiently reposition customers and undertake capital improvements or other modifications on their behalf without the need to obtain third-party approvals. Our decision to own, rather than lease, a significant majority of our warehouses provides us with better control over the specialized nature of our assets and greater influence over our warehouse locations on a long-term basis, which is crucial to meeting our customers’ “mission-critical” cold chain needs.
Initial Public Offering
On January 23, 2018, we completed an initial public offering of our common shares, or IPO, in which we issued and sold 33,350,000 of our common shares, including 4,350,000 common shares pursuant to the exercise in full of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional common shares. The offering generated net proceeds of

approximately $493.6 million to us, after deducting underwriting fees and other offering costs of approximately $40.0 million. For more information on the IPO, please refer to Note 1 of our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Follow-On Offering
On September 18, 2018, we completed a follow-on public offering of 4,000,000 of our common shares at a public offering price of $24.50 per share, which generated net proceeds of approximately $92.5 million to us after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us, and an additional 6,000,000 common shares that are subject to a forward sale agreement to be settled within one year. We did not initially receive any proceeds from the sale of the common shares subject to the forward sale agreement that were sold by the forward purchaser or its affiliate. As of December 31, 2018, we have not settled any portion of the forward sale agreement. In connection with the the follow-on public offering, YF ART Holdings GP, LLC (YF ART Holdings), a partnership among investment funds affiliated with The Yucaipa Companies (Yucaipa), sold 16.5 million common shares, affiliates of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (the GS entities) sold approximately 9.1 million common shares, and affiliates of Fortress sold approximately 7.2 million common shares.

BUSINESS STRATEGY AND OPERATING SEGMENTS
We were formed as a Maryland REIT on December 27, 2002. Our operating partnership was formed as a Delaware limited partnership on April 5, 2010. Our operations are conducted through our operating partnership and its subsidiaries.
Our primary business objective is to increase shareholder value by serving our customers, growing our market share, enhancing our operating and financial results and increasing cash flows from operations. We also believe that our ability to execute on our business and growth strategies will enhance the overall value of our real estate. The strategies we intend to execute to achieve these objectives include the following:
Enhancing Our Operating and Financial Results Through Proactive Asset Management
We seek to enhance our operating and financial results by supporting our customers’ growth initiatives in the cold chain, optimizing occupancy, underwriting and deploying yield management initiatives and executing operational optimization and cost containment strategies. We believe that the combination of our ability to execute these and other initiatives and the significant investments we have made in our business over the last five fiscal years will continue to drive our financial results and position us to expand our warehouse portfolio, grow our customer base, enhance our market share and create value for our shareholders.

Continue to Increase Committed Revenue in Our Warehouse Segment
Historically, providers of temperature-controlled warehouse space have offered storage services to customers on an as-utilized, on-demand basis. We actively seek to enter into contracts that implement our commercial business rules which contemplate, among other things, fixed storage commitments in connection with establishing new customer relationships or renewing agreements with existing customers, particularly with our largest customers, and variable rates for the value-added services we provide. Over the last several years, we have transitioned a significant portion of our rent and storage revenues generated on an as-utilized, on-demand basis to a fixed storage commitment basis. We believe the scope and breadth of our network position us favorably to continue to increase our fixed storage commitments as we believe this structure offers commercial advantages to both our customers and us.
Focused and Disciplined Strategy to Expand Our Portfolio of Temperature-Controlled Warehouses
We believe our operating systems, scalable information technology platform and economies of scale provide us with a significant advantage over our competitors with respect to expansion, development and acquisition opportunities. Becoming the first publicly traded REIT focused on the temperature-controlled warehouse industry has given us greater access to the capital markets than our competitors, which we believe will allow us to strategically enter new locations, fill gaps in existing distribution networks and effectively compete for expansion, development and acquisition opportunities.
Capitalize on Increased Outsourcing by Leading Global Food Producers, Distributors, Retailers and E-Tailers
Over the last 35 years, frozen food producers, distributors, retailers and e-tailers have increasingly outsourced their temperature-controlled warehousing needs to increase efficiency, reduce costs and redeploy capital into core businesses. We anticipate that cold chain participants will continue to make certain of their “in-house” temperature-controlled warehouses available for sale in the future and, accordingly, will continue to look to third-party providers to meet their temperature-controlled warehouse storage and service needs in related geographic markets. We believe that our ability to offer the most extensive and integrated network of high-quality temperature-controlled warehouses globally with value-added services and our long-standing relationships with leading cold chain participants will enable us to capitalize on this trend.
Well Positioned to Benefit from E-Commerce Growth
Our warehouse portfolio serves as a fundamental bridge between food producers and fulfillment centers - whether for online e-tailers or traditional brick and mortar retailers. We believe our ability to design, build and operate warehouses across the cold chain makes us an attractive storage solution for the growing e-tailer segment and positions us well to generate new relationships, drive growth and capture market share by increasing our presence in the e-commerce channel.
Expand Our Presence by Increasing Market Share for Other Temperature-Sensitive Product Types
Although we focus on providing temperature-controlled warehouse space to the food industry, we also store other forms of temperature-sensitive products, including pharmaceutical, floral and chemical products. As the rapid growth in e-commerce continues to increase the flow of products through the global distribution network, we believe our ability to provide comprehensive and consistent quality warehousing and value-added services at all points in the cold chain put us in a strong position to develop new relationships, drive growth and enhance market share with producers, distributors, retailers and e-tailers in other temperature-sensitive products. Additionally, we have the flexibility to store non-temperature-sensitive “dry” goods in our warehouses to the extent desirable.

Investments in Our Warehouses
We employ a strategic investment approach to maintain a high-quality portfolio of temperature-controlled warehouses to ensure that our warehouses meet the “mission-critical” role they serve in the cold chain. We have successfully modernized many of our warehouses to reduce our power costs and increase their competitive position through reliable temperature-control systems that can implement distinct temperature zones within the same warehouse. In addition, we use LED lighting, motion-sensor technology, variable frequency drives for our fans and compressors, third-party efficiency reviews and real-time monitoring of energy consumption, high speed doors and alternative-power generation technologies to improve the energy efficiency of our warehouses. We believe that our warehouses are well-maintained and in good operating condition.
Our Business Segments
We view and manage our business through three primary business segments—warehouse, third-party managed and transportation.
Our core business is our warehouse segment, where we provide temperature-controlled warehouse storage and related handling and other warehouse services. In our warehouse segment, we collect rent and storage fees from customers to store their frozen and perishable food and other products within our real estate portfolio. We also provide our customers with handling and other warehouse services related to the products stored in our buildings that are designed to optimize their movement through the cold chain, such as the placement of food products for storage and preservation, the retrieval of products from storage upon customer request, case-picking, blast freezing, kitting and repackaging and other recurring handling services. We refer to these handling and other services as our value-added services.
Under our third-party managed segment, we manage warehouses on behalf of third parties and provide warehouse management services to several leading food retailers and manufacturers in customer-owned facilities, including some of our largest and longest-standing customers. We believe using our third-party management services allows our customers to increase efficiency, reduce costs, reduce supply-chain risks and focus on their core businesses. We also believe that providing third-party management services to many of our key customers underscores our ability to offer a complete and integrated suite of services across the cold chain.
In our transportation segment, we broker and manage transportation of frozen and perishable food and other products for our customers. Our transportation services include consolidation services (i.e., consolidating a customer’s products with those of other customers for more efficient shipment), freight under management services (i.e., arranging for and overseeing transportation of customer inventory) and dedicated transportation services, each designed to improve efficiency and reduce transportation and logistics costs to our customers. We provide these transportation services at cost plus a service fee or, in the case of our consolidation services, we charge a fixed fee.
We also operate a limestone quarry on the land we own around our Carthage, Missouri warehouse, which contains substantial limestone deposits. We do not view the operation of the quarry as an integral part of our business.

Customers
Our global footprint enables us to efficiently serve approximately 2,400 customers consisting primarily of producers, distributors, retailers and e-tailers of frozen and perishable food products, such as fruits, vegetables, meats, seafood, novelties, dairy and packaged foods. We believe the creditworthiness and geographic diversity of our customer base provide us with stable cash flows and a strong platform for growth. The weighted average length of our relationship with our 25 largest customers in our warehouse segment exceeds 33 years. The total warehouse segment revenues generated by our 25 largest customers in our warehouse segment have been steady over the last three years, representing 63%, 61% and 61% of our total warehouse segment revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Each of these 25 largest customers has been in our network for the entirety of these periods.

Seasonality
We are involved in providing services to food producers, distributors, retailers and e-tailers whose businesses, in some cases, are seasonal or cyclical. On a portfolio-wide basis, physical occupancy rates and warehouse revenues are generally the lowest during May and June. Physical occupancy rates and warehouse revenues typically exhibit a gradual increase thereafter as a result of annual harvests and our customers building inventories in connection with end-of-year holidays and generally peak between mid-September and early December as a result thereof. In each year since 2015, we have generated higher than average revenues and our warehouses have experienced the highest occupancy levels in October or November. The involvement of our customers in a cross-section of the food industry mitigates, in part, the impact of seasonality as peak demand for various products occurs at different times of the year (for example, demand for ice cream is typically highest in the summer while demand for frozen turkeys usually peaks in the late fall). Our southern hemisphere operations in Australia, New Zealand and Argentina also help balance the impact of seasonality in our global operations, as their growing and harvesting cycles are complementary to North America. Each of our warehouses sets its own operating hours based on demand, which is heavily driven by growing seasons and seasonal consumer demand for certain products.
Competition
In our industry, the principal competitive factors are warehouse location, warehouse size, breadth and interconnectivity of warehouse networks, quality, type of service and price. For refrigerated food customers, transportation costs are typically significantly greater than warehousing costs and, accordingly, location and transportation capabilities are major competitive factors. The size of a warehouse is important in part because large customers generally prefer to have all of their products needed to serve a given market in a single location and to have the flexibility to increase storage at that single location during seasonal peaks. In areas with direct local competition, customers generally will select a temperature-controlled warehouse based upon service level, price and the quality of the warehouse. In addition, some food producers and distributors attend to their own warehousing and distribution needs by either building or leasing warehouses, creating a private warehousing market which may compete with the public warehouse industry. Many customers, including those for whom private warehousing is a viable option, will select distribution services based upon service level and price, provided that an appropriate network of related storage facilities is available. The breadth and quality of information and integrated logistics management services provided are additional and increasingly important bases upon which we compete in the marketplace. In addition, we compete for the business of customers and potential customers who may choose to provide temperature-controlled warehousing in-house.
United States
Outside the five largest owners of temperature-controlled warehouses, the United States temperature-controlled warehouse industry is highly fragmented among numerous owners and operators. We believe our main competitors include Lineage Logistics, LLC, Preferred Freezer Services, LLC, United States Cold Storage, Inc. (an affiliate of John Swire & Sons), AGRO Merchants Group, Interstate Warehousing, Cloverleaf Cold Storage, NewCold, and Henningsen Cold Storage Co, in addition to numerous other local, regional and national temperature-controlled warehouse owners and operators.
Australia
Our main competitors in Australia include Emergent, A.B. Oxford, Montagues (acquired by Emergent Cold during February 2019) and NewCold, which operate warehouses and service many of the Australian markets. Generally, our other competitors operate in only one region and do not compete in the retail market that comprises the majority of our revenues.
8

New Zealand
Our main competitors in New Zealand are PolarCold Stores and Halls Transport. Polar Cold operates an estimated seven warehouses and is the largest public warehouse operator in New Zealand. Polarcold Stores specializes in bulk storage and focuses on the commodity market with warehouses located near New Zealand’s ports. Halls Transport is primarily a transporter that also operates a network of 3 warehouses. Generally, our other competitors also service the commodity market and operate in only one region.
Argentina
We have several competitors in the Buenos Aires market, which in the past tended to be smaller single-site operations or fragmented networks. While we are aware some operators are considering consolidating public warehouse facilities in Argentina, the greatest sources of competition in Argentina are the disproportionate number of producers (compared to the United States) that continue to in-source their temperature-controlled storage needs.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, worldwide we employed approximately 11,000 people, approximately 56% of which were represented by various local labor unions and associations, and 84 of our 155 warehouses have unionized associates that are governed by 69 different collective bargaining agreements. We are currently in negotiations for five new agreements. Since January 1, 2016, we have successfully negotiated 55 collective bargaining agreements without any work stoppages. As of December 31, 2018, we have completed collective bargaining for an additional three agreement renewals and are awaiting ratification votes. Additionally, we have one agreement that has expired and the Company and union are operating under the expired agreement while continuing negotiations.
During 2019, we will engage in negotiations for an additional 12 agreements covering all or parts of 29 operating locations worldwide. We do not anticipate any workplace disruptions during this renewal process.
REGULATORY MATTERS 
Many laws and governmental regulations are applicable to our properties and changes in these laws and regulations, or interpretation of such laws and regulations by agencies and the courts, occur frequently.
9

Environmental Matters
Our operations are subject to a wide range of environmental laws and regulations in each of the locations in which we operate, and compliance with these requirements involves significant capital and operating costs. Failure to comply with these environmental requirements can result in civil or criminal fines or sanctions, claims for environmental damages, remediation obligations, revocation of environmental permits or restrictions on our operations. Future changes in environmental laws or in the interpretation of those laws, including stricter requirements affecting our operations, could result in increased capital and operating costs, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects and, consequently, amounts available for distribution to our shareholders.
Food Safety Regulations
Most of our warehouses are subject to compliance with federal regulations regarding food safety. Under the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, the United States Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, requires us to register all warehouses in which food is stored and further requires us to maintain records of sources and recipients of food for purposes of food recalls. 
The Food Safety Modernization Act, or FSMA significantly expanded the FDA’s authority over food safety, providing the FDA with new tools to proactively ensure the safety of the entire food system, including new hazard analysis and preventive controls requirements, food safety planning, requirements for sanitary transportation of food, and increased inspections and mandatory food recalls under certain circumstances. The most significant rule under the FSMA which impacts our business is the Current Good Manufacturing Practice and Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Human Food rule. This rule requires a food facility to establish a food safety system that includes an analysis of hazards and the implementation of risk-based preventive controls, among other steps. This is in addition to requirements that we satisfy existing Good Manufacturing Practices with respect to the holding of foods, as set forth in FDA regulations. The USDA also grants to some of our warehouses “ID status,” which entitles us to handle products of the USDA. As a result of the regulatory framework from the FDA, the USDA and other local regulatory requirements, we subject our warehouses to periodic food safety audits which are for the most part carried out by ASI Food Safety Consultants, a third-party provider of such audits. In addition to meeting any applicable food safety, food facility registration and record-keeping requirements, our customers often require us to perform food safety audits.
To the extent we fail to comply with existing food safety regulations or contractual obligations, or are required to comply with new regulations or obligations in the future, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects, as well as the amount of funds available for distribution to our shareholders.
Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA
Our properties are subject to regulation under OSHA, which requires employers to provide employees with an environment free from hazards, such as exposure to toxic chemicals, excessive noise levels, mechanical dangers, heat or cold stress and unsanitary conditions. In addition, due to the amount of ammonia stored at some of our facilities, we are also subject to compliance with OSHA’s Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals standard and OSHA’s ongoing National Emphasis Program related to potential releases of highly hazardous chemicals. The cost of complying with OSHA and similar laws enacted by states and other jurisdictions in which we operate can be substantial, and any failure to comply with these regulations could expose us to substantial penalties and potentially to liabilities to employees who may be injured at our warehouses.
10

International Regulations
Our international facilities are subject to a number of local laws and regulations which govern a wide range of matters, including building, environmental, health and safety, hazardous substances and new organisms, waste minimization, as well as specific requirements for the storage of meat, dairy products, fish, poultry, agricultural and other products. Any products destined for export must also satisfy the applicable export requirements. A failure to comply with, or the cost of complying with, these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects and, consequently the amounts available for distribution to our shareholders.
INSURANCE COVERAGE
We carry comprehensive general liability, fire, extended coverage, business interruption and umbrella liability coverage on all of our properties with limits of liability which we deem adequate. Similarly, we are insured against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts we believe to be adequate to reimburse us on a replacement basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property, including loss of business profits during the reconstruction period. We also carry coverage for customers’ products in our warehouses that are damaged due to our negligence. The cost of all such insurance is passed through to customers as part of their regular rates for storage and handling.
We are self-insured for workers’ compensation and health insurance under a large-deductible program, meaning that we have accrued liabilities in amounts that we consider appropriate to cover losses in these areas. In addition, we maintain excess loss coverage to insure against losses in excess of the reserves that we have established for these claims in amounts that we consider appropriate. However, in the unlikely event that our loss experience exceeds our reserves and the limits of our excess loss policies, there could be material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects.
We will not carry insurance for generally uninsured losses such as loss from riots or war; however, we do include coverage for risks across all programs for acts of terrorism. We carry earthquake insurance on our properties in areas known to be seismically active and flood insurance on our properties in areas known to be flood zones, in an amount and with deductibles which we believe are commercially reasonable. We also carry insurance coverage relating to cybersecurity incidents.
