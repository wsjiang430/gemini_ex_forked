Item 1. Business
Company Overview
 
Cosmos Holdings Inc. ("us", "we", or the "Company") is a multinational pharmaceutical wholesaler. The Company imports, exports and distributes pharmaceutical products of brand-name and generic pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, a variety of dietary and vitamin supplements. Currently, the Company distributes products mainly in the EU countries via its two wholly owned subsidiaries Skypharm SA and Decahedron Ltd. SkyPharm operates from its facilities in Greece and Decahedron from its facilities in the UK. Most of our business derives from purchasing and reselling branded pharmaceutical products. Large pharmaceutical manufacturers have variable pricing strategies within the EU. The varying prices allow us to source products produced by multi-national pharmaceutical companies in different countries throughout Europe and export them into countries that pay more for those products.
 
Our core operations were focused on expanding the business of SkyPharm and Decahedron. The Company’s focus is primarily on branded pharmaceutical and some generic pharmaceuticals. The Company has also begun to expand into the food supplements industry and has already created its own line of vitamins and food supplement products. The Company plans to also expand its operations into the cosmetic/beauty industry. Through the sale of pharmaceutical products, the Company has created a wide network of pharmaceutical wholesalers and pharmacies that we believe we can utilize to promote and sell our vitamins, food supplements and cosmetic/beauty products. There is growing demand for various food supplements and other cosmetic and beauty products. We plan to serve this demand by offering quality products to our existing network of wholesalers and pharmacies. Pharmacies are still the key channels for distribution and sales of food supplements in the European market. 
 
In addition, we expanded into the full-line wholesale distribution business through the December 2018 acquisition of Cosmofarm Ltd. Full-line pharmaceutical wholesalers provide the local markets with branded pharmaceuticals, generic pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, vitamins, and food supplements. By expanding our pharmaceutical distribution business, we expect to have the ability to source branded and generic products directly from manufacturers and sell vitamins, food supplements, and cosmetic products directly to pharmacies that the full-line wholesalers currently sell. We expect this expansion to increase our sales and profit margins as we vertically integrate into the supply chain.
 
Concerning our vitamins and food supplement division, we have expanded our business in developing our own brand of vitamins and food supplements. The brand name of our product line is Sky Life Premium. We have a contract with Doc Pharma S.A. to develop and manufacture the products according to our specifications. Doc Pharma S.A is considered a related party to the Company due to the fact that the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) of Doc Pharma is the wife of Grigorios Siokas, the Company’s CEO and principal shareholder, who also served as a principal of Doc Pharma SA in the past. Sales of our own brand of nutraceuticals began in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our current business has provided us with access to wholesalers both from the sourcing and the sales division of our wholesale business. We intend to sell our products to vendors that supply us with pharmaceutical products as well as to our clients to whom we currently sell pharmaceutical products.
 
We are also closely monitoring the legal framework for prescription and non-prescription derivates of cannabis products as it develops in Europe. As the legal framework and processes are developed and implemented in each respective EU country, we will utilize our existing network to distribute both prescription and non-prescription derivates of cannabis products to our current customer base. We currently intend to only distribute prescription and non-prescription derivates of cannabis products to approved EU countries and not in the US. The Company intends to await further clarification from the U.S. Government on cannabis regulation prior to determining whether to enter the domestic market.

We regularly evaluate acquisition targets that would allow us to expand our distribution reach and/or vertically integrate into the supply chain of the products that we currently distribute. We believe that the demand for reasonably-priced medicines, delivered on time and in the highest quality is set to increase in the years to come, as the population’s life expectancy increases. With our product portfolio of patented and non-patented medicines, we contribute to the optimization of efficient medicinal care, and thereby lowering cost for health insurance funds, companies, and patients. We also believe that the demand for non-prescription wellness products such as food and dietary supplements will continue to increase as individuals are increasingly supplementing their nutritional intake.
 
We believe the EU pharmaceutical import/export market will continue to grow. We continue to encounter competition in the market as we grow. The competition comes in the form of level of service, reliability, and product quality. On the procurement side we continue to expand our vendor base. In order to minimize business risks, we diversify our sources of supply. We maintain our high-quality standards by carefully selecting and qualifying our suppliers as well as actively ensuring that our suppliers meet our standard of quality control on an ongoing basis. 
 
As of July 22, 2015, the Hellenic Ministry of Health and more specifically the National Organization for Medicines granted to SkyPharm a license for the wholesale of pharmaceutical products for human use. The license is valid for a period of five years and pursuant to the EU directive of (2013/C343/02). SkyPharm is subject to the Guidelines of the Good Distribution Practices of the European Union (the “Good Distribution Practices”) for the sale and distribution of medical products for human use. SkyPharm believes it has properly incorporated all the methodologies, procedures, processes and resources in order to be in accordance with the guidelines of the Good Distribution Practices. Our warehouse has been equipped with the proper equipment, specifically with the proper shelves, working tables, medicines, cold fridge and barcode machines to comply with all requirements. The Company commenced sales of pharmaceutical products in the beginning of November 2015.
 
Decahedron received its Wholesale Distribution Authorization for human use on November 7, 2013, from the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in accordance with Regulation 18 of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/1916) and it is subject to the provision of those Regulations and the Medicines Act 1971. This license will continue to remain in force from the date of issue by the Licensing Authority unless cancelled, suspended, revoked or varied as to the period of its validity or relinquished by the authorization holder.
 
Business Environment
 
The Company conducts its business within the pharmaceutical industry and is active in both branded and generic pharmaceutical product markets. The pharmaceutical industry is a highly competitive and is subject to comprehensive government regulations. Many factors may significantly affect the Company’s sales of its products, including, but not limited to, efficacy, safety, price and cost-effectiveness, marketing effectiveness, product labeling, quality control and quality assurance. Currently, most of the products that the Company is trading, compete with other products already on the market in the same therapeutic category, and are subject to potential competition from new products that competitors may introduce in the future.
 
Generic medicines are the pharmaceutical and therapeutic equivalents of branded pharmaceutical products and are generally marketed under their generic (chemical) names rather than by brand names. Typically, a generic drug may not be marketed until the expiration of applicable patent(s) on the corresponding branded product, unless a resolution of patent litigation results in an earlier opportunity to enter the market. Generic drugs are the same as branded products in dosage form, safety, efficacy, route of administration, quality, performance characteristics and intended use, but they are sold generally at prices below those of the corresponding branded products. Generic drugs provide a cost-effective alternative for consumers, while maintaining the same high quality, efficacy, safety profile, purity and stability of the branded product.

The Company started operating within the Health Products & Food Supplement industry markets in October 2017. These specific industries are highly competitive, and many factors may significantly affect the Company’s sales of its products, including, but not limited to, price and cost-effectiveness, marketing effectiveness, product labeling, quality control and quality assurance. Currently, the Company has added food supplements into the portfolio of products that it wholesales to its clients. The Company has also developed and began selling its own brand of food supplements under the brand name Sky Life Premium. 
 
Corporate Strategy
 
The main strategy initiative is focused on continuing our progress in becoming a global pharmaceutical wholesale and import/export company through the development of a lean and efficient operating model, we are committed to serving our customers while continuing to innovate and provide products that make a difference in the lives of individuals. We strive to maximize our shareholders’ value by adapting to market realities and customer needs. Our strategy involves building a multinational network or wholesalers, distributors, and pharmacies and simultaneously continuing to expand the portfolio of products that we distribute to that network. 
 
We are committed to driving organic growth at attractive margins by improving execution, optimizing cash flow and leveraging our strong market position, while maintaining a streamlined cost structure throughout each of our businesses. We continue to further align our organization to our customer’ needs in a more seamless and unified way, while supporting corporate strategy and accelerating growth. Implementing this disciplined, focused strategy has allowed us to significantly expand our business, and we believe we are well-positioned to grow revenue and increase operating income through the execution of the following key elements of our business:
 


· | Optimize and Grow Our Pharmaceutical Sourcing and Distribution Businesses. We believe we are well-positioned in size and market breadth to continue to grow our trading businesses as we invest to improve our operating and capital efficiencies. Sourcing and distribution, including specialty pharmaceuticals, anchors our growth and position in the pharmaceutical supply channel as we provide superior services and deliver value-added products, which improve the efficiency and competitiveness of healthcare providers, thus allowing the pharmaceutical supply channel to better deliver healthcare to patients. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Branded Pharmaceuticals: Branded pharmaceutical products are the primary product category that we import and export. We constantly evaluate product availability, pricing, demand trends, and patent expirations to maximize our performance. As the patents for branded products near expiration, the generic equivalents enter the market place and the demand for those branded products start to decrease. We monitor these cycles closely and always look to find value in pricing fluctuations caused by the patent expirations as the generic equivalents enter the market. 
· | Generic Pharmaceuticals: Generic pharmaceutical products are the secondary product category that we import and export. We apply the same discipline to generics that we do to the branded. We evaluate the demand and supply dynamics of branded products as their patents expire. This insight sheds light on the demand of generic products that take their place. Understanding the historical and market specific characteristics of generic product demand provides insight that we use to give guidance to our vendors that source our generic drug exports. 
· | Health Products & Food Supplements: The wholesale distribution of food supplements offer greater margins than pharmaceutical product distribution. We are always looking to expand the portfolio of products that we distribute to maximize our margins. We also convenience our customers by providing them a larger portfolio of products that they can source from a single vendor. In addition to being wholesalers for food supplements and related products we also created our own brand of products to sell to our current customer base. Our wholesale business gives insight to what products are in demand and we communicate with our customer base to identify which products to develop. We have a contract with Doc Pharma to develop and manufacture the products according to our specifications. Doc Pharma S.A is considered a related party to the Company due to the fact that the CEO of Doc Pharma is the wife of Grigorios Siokas, the Company’s CEO and principal shareholder, who also served as a principal of Doc Pharma SA in the past. Sales of our own brand of nutraceuticals began in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our own branded nutraceuticals carry significantly higher margins than simply serving as a wholesaler for other brands.

· | Research & Development: We are committed to strategic R&D across each business unit with a particular focus for food supplements with inherently lower risk profiles and clearly defined regulatory pathways. We are constantly evaluating the demand for food supplements in the markets that we currently distribute pharmaceutical products to. This research and analysis determine which food and nutritional supplements we choose to develop as well as their formulations. This approach maximizes the probability of successfully competing with other brands in the marketplace. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Acquisitions: We regularly evaluate acquisition targets that would allow us to expand our distribution reach and/or vertically integrate into the supply chain of the products that we currently distribute. In addition to focusing on organic growth drivers, we are also actively pursuing accretive acquisitions that offer long-term revenue growth, margin expansion through synergies, and the ability to maintain a flexible capital structure. 
· | Cannabis derived products: We closely monitor the legal framework for prescription and non-prescription derivates of cannabis products as it develops in Europe. As the legal framework and processes are developed and implemented in each respective EU country, we will utilize our existing network to distribute both prescription and non-prescription derivates of cannabis products to our current customer base. We currently intend to only distribute prescription and non-prescription derivates of cannabis products to approved EU countries and not in the US. 
· | Local & Direct to Pharmacy Wholesale: We are expanding into the full-line wholesale distribution business through acquisition. Full-line pharmaceutical wholesalers provide the local markets with branded pharmaceuticals, generic pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, vitamins and food supplements. By expanding our pharmaceutical distribution business, we will have a better ability to source more branded and generic products directly from manufacturers and sell our vitamins, food supplements and cosmetic products directly to pharmacies for better prices. We expect this expansion to increase our sales and profit margins as we vertically integrate into the supply chain.

  To successfully execute our corporate strategy, we believe that the Company must adopt, incorporate and maintain the aforementioned core strengths, although no assurances can be made that the Company will be able to effectively implement these strategies.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
The majority of our products are represented directly and indirectly through a dedicated sales force team. Our sales force targets mainly wholesale distributors and other healthcare providers. We sell our products principally through independent wholesale distributors, but we also sell directly to other healthcare providers such as; clinics, government agencies, independent retail and specialty pharmacies and independent specialty distributors. Customer service representatives are centralized in order to respond to customer needs in a timely and effective manner.
 
The following diagram illustrates the Company’s typical sales cycle:

Products & Services
 
The current principal activity of SkyPharm is the trading of branded and generic pharmaceutical products and medicines across the European Union member states. SkyPharm operates as a buyer from wholesale pharmaceutical companies and as a reseller to other companies. The principal activity of Decahedron is the same as the business of SkyPharm. It is the trading of branded and generic pharmaceutical products and medicines across mainly the European Union member states. Decahedron buys from pharmacies and other wholesale pharmaceutical companies and resells these products mainly to other EU countries. We purchase excess inventories at a discount from wholesalers and export approximately 11,000 pharmaceutical product codes and EU member states capturing contract price differentials in the process. The Company only purchases stock with purchase orders at hand, limiting inventory risk. EU countries have put into force new legal frameworks and mandates that boost the parallel trade market in order to deflate healthcare pricing across the region. We have over 160 clients and vendors in Germany, UK, France, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Poland, Sweden Hungary, UAE, Singapore, Indonesia, Jordan, Greece and Bulgaria.  The parallel pharmaceutical trade in the EU was approximately €5.5 bn in fiscal 2016 according to The European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations. “The Pharmaceutical Industry in Figures,” Brussels EFPIA 2017. The major parallel exporting countries are Greece, Czech Republic and Slovakia, while major importing countries are Germany, United Kingdom, France, Italy and Netherlands. Thus, SkyPharm and Decahedron are each an operator and the mechanism between the supply and demand sides in the wholesale market. The Company could be characterized as the middle ring of this distribution channel. 
 
The operational business life cycle performed by the Company could be described as follows:
 

a. | Searching and analyzing within market the demand and price of medicines; 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
b. | Demand list placement by the clients including specific medicines, volumes and prices;
c. | Research availability of the demanded medicines in the market; 
d. | Choosing the appropriate supplier based upon available medicines and volumes; 
e. | Order placement by the client; 
f. | Checking control of the relevant authorities; 
g. | Purchase of the medicines from the wholesaler; 


h. | Assortment and storage of the medicines in the Company's facilities;
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------
i. | Packaging the medicines according to the buyer's order list; 
j. | Delivery of the medicines to clients facilities; and 
k. | Direct payment for the shipment. 

 
We believe that the entire aforementioned product life cycle would take approximately six weeks to two months, from the demand list to the payment for the shipment with an average gross profit of 7.5%.
 
Our subsidiaries SkyPharm and Decahedron trade over 400 different types of pharmaceutical products with the principal products being the following:
 

Product Description | Percentage of Total Current Sales | Treatment 
--------------------+------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------
OTOMIZE EAR SPRAY | 2.16% | Treatment of otitis externa 
ELIQUIS TABL COAT | 2.01% | Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism
SYMBICORT TURB. | 1.94% | Relief of asthma symptoms

We are formulating a broader and more diversified pharmaceutical product portfolio and a greater selection of targets for potential development. We target products with limited competition for reasons such as trading complexity or the market size, which make our pharmaceutical products a key growth driver of our portfolio and complementary to other product offerings.
 
On September 30, 2018, the Company sold 100% of the share capital of Amplerissimo was, the former owner of SkyPharm which is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cosmos Holdings, to an unaffiliated third party. The information technology business of Amplerissimo is not a priority of the Company and we are not currently pursuing such business. The Company is focusing its efforts in expanding the pharmaceutical trading was not a priority of the Company. The Company had no interest in pursuing such business.
 
Customers 
 
Through our subsidiaries, SkyPharm and Decahedron, we primarily sell pharmaceutical products directly to a limited number of large wholesale drug distributors who, in turn, supply-sell the products to other wholesalers, hospitals, pharmacies, governmental agencies across the European Union member states. Total revenues from the customers that accounted for 10% or more of our total consolidated revenues during the years ended December 31, 2018 & 2017 are as follows:

 | 2018 | | | 2017
---------------------------+------+-------+---+-----
MPA Pharma GmbH | | 15.13 | % | | 27.97 | %
Beragena Arzneimittel GmbH | | 11.36 | % | | 10.98 | %
Dr. Fisher Pharma B.V. | | 4.87 | % | | 10.94 | %

 
No other customer generated over 10% of our total revenues.
 
We have a diverse customer base that includes wholesalers and retail healthcare providers. We make a significant amount of our sales to a relatively small number of pharmaceutical wholesalers. These customers represent an essential part of the distribution chain of our products. Pharmaceutical wholesalers have undergone, and are continuing to undergo, significant consolidation in a worldwide basis. This consolidation resulted in these groups gaining additional purchasing leverage and consequently increasing the product pricing pressures facing our business. 
 
Geographic Markets
 
All of our revenues are generated from operations in the European Union or otherwise earned outside the U.S. All of our foreign operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business abroad, including price and currency exchange controls, fluctuations in the relative values of currencies, political and economic instability and restrictive governmental actions including. Our geographical market sales distribution of our total consolidated revenues during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are as follows:

 | 2018 | | | 2017

We currently sell the products to wholesalers through our own sales force. We do not sell directly to large drug store chains or through distributors in countries where we do not have our own sales staff. As part of our sales marketing and promotion program, we use direct advertising, direct mailings, trading techniques, direct and personal contacts, exhibition of products at medical conventions and sponsor medical education symposia. 
 
Suppliers
 
We obtain pharmaceuticals and over the counter pharmaceutical products directly from manufacturers and other wholesalers of pharmaceutical products, three of which set forth below, each accounted for more than 10% of our purchases in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. The loss of a supplier could adversely affect our business if alternate sources of supply are unavailable since we are committed to be the primary source of pharmaceutical products for a majority of our customers. We believe that our relationships with our suppliers are strong. The 10 largest suppliers in fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 accounted for approximately 80% of our purchases.

 | 2018 | | | 2017
----------------------------------------+------+-------+---+-----
Medihelm Farmakapothiki S.A | | 35.25 | % | | 35.86 | %
Doc Pharma S.A | | 15.61 | % | | 18.80 | %
Nikolaos Katsinoulas Farmakapothiki S.A | | 8.75 | % | | 13.35 | %

 
Medihelm S.A. is considered a related party to the Company due to the fact that the managing director of Medihelm is the mother of Nicholaos Lazarou, the managing director of the Company’s UK subsidiary, Decahedron. 
 
Doc Pharma S.A is considered a related party to the Company due to the fact that the CEO of Doc Pharma is the wife of Grigorios Siokas, the Company’s CEO and principal shareholder, who also served as a principal of Doc Pharma SA in the past.
 
Competition
 
Our pharmaceutical businesses are conducted in intensely competitive and often highly regulated markets. Many of our trading pharmaceutical products face competition in the form of branded or generic drugs that treat similar diseases or indications. The principal forms of competition include efficacy, safety, ease of use, and cost effectiveness. The means of competition vary across product categories and business groups, demonstrating the value of our trading products is a critical factor for success in all of our principal businesses.
 
Our competitors include other trading companies, smaller companies, with generic drug and consumer healthcare products. We compete with other companies that manufacture and sell products that treat diseases or indications similar to those treated by our trading pharmaceutical products.
 
Our competitive position in pharmaceutical sector is affected by several factors, including, among others, the amount and effectiveness of our and our competitors' promotional resources; customer acceptance; product quality; our and our competitors' introduction of new products, ingredients, claims, dosage forms, or other forms of innovation; and pricing, regulatory and legislative matters (such as product labeling, patient access and prescription). 
 
The branded pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive. Our products compete with products manufactured by many other companies in highly competitive markets throughout the EU territory and internationally as well. Competitors include many of the major brand name and generic manufacturers of pharmaceutical products. If competitors introduce new products, delivery systems or processes with therapeutic or cost advantages, our products can be subject to progressive price reductions or decreased volume of sales, or both.

In the generic pharmaceutical market, we might face intense competition from other generic drug manufacturers, brand name pharmaceutical companies, existing brand equivalents and manufacturers of therapeutically similar drugs.
 
By specializing in high barrier to entry products, we endeavor to market more profitable and longer-lived products relative to commodity generic products. We believe that our competitive advantages include our integrated team-based approach to product development that combines our formulation, regulatory, legal and commercial capabilities; our ability to introduce new generic equivalents for brand-name drugs; our ability to meet customer expectations; and the breadth of our existing generic product portfolio offering.
 
Newly introduced generic products with limited or no other generic competition typically garner higher prices. At the expiration of the exclusivity period, other generic distributors may enter the market, resulting in a significant price decline for the drug. Consequently, the maintenance of profitable operations in generic pharmaceuticals depends, in part, on our ability to select, develop and launch new generic products in a timely and cost-efficient manner and to maintain efficient, high quality business capabilities.
 
Operating conditions have become more challenging under the mounting global pressures of competition, industry regulation and cost containment. We continue to take measures to evaluate, adapt and improve our organization and business practices to better meet customer and public needs. We also seek to continually enhance the organizational effectiveness of all of our functions, including efforts to accurately and ethically launch and promote our products. 
 
Information Systems 
 
The Company operates its full-service wholesale pharmaceutical distribution facilities in the Europe on one primary enterprise resource planning ("ERP") system that provides for, among other things, electronic order entry by customers, invoice preparation and purchasing, and inventory tracking. We are currently making significant investments to enhance and upgrade the ERP system. 
 
Additionally, we are improving our entity-wide infrastructure environment to drive efficiency, capabilities, and speed to market. We will continue to invest in advanced information systems and automated warehouse technology. For example, in an effort to comply with future pedigree and other supply chain custody requirements we expect to continue to make significant investments in our secure supply chain information systems.
 
The Company processes a substantial portion of its purchase orders, invoices, and payments electronically. However, it continues to make substantial investments to expand its electronic interface with its suppliers. The Company has integrated warehouse operating system, which are used to manage the majority of transactional volume. The warehouse operating system has improved the distribution services productivity and operating leverage.
 
Government Regulations
 
Government authorities in the EU and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, approval, manufacturing, labeling, post-approval monitoring and reporting, packaging, advertising and promotion, storage, distribution, marketing and export and import of pharmaceutical products. As such, our branded pharmaceutical products and the generic product candidates are subject to extensive regulation both before and after approval. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in, among other things, warning letters, civil penalties, delays in approving or refusal to approve a pharmaceutical product.

Our business is mainly the trading of branded and generic pharmaceutical products and medicines within the EU member states. In order to be able to operate our business, we need to comply with EU regulations, as well as EU member states regulations that govern various operations of our business. The most important government regulation that applies in our business is the granting to our companies SkyPharm and Decahedron of the Authorization for Wholesale Distribution of Medicinal Products for human use. In order for this Authorization to be granted the companies need to always comply with certain Good Distribution Practices (GDP) that mainly assure the proper storage, handling, distribution and trade of the pharmaceutical products.
 
SkyPharm received its Authorization for the Wholesale Distribution of Medical Products for humans use on July 22, 2015, from the Hellenic Republic National Organization for Medicines in accordance with Law 1316/1983, and the inspection by the National Organization for Medicines dated July 16, 2015 in accordance with the Guidelines 2013/C31/01. The license is valid for five years and expires on July 22, 2020. Pursuant to the EU directive of (2013/C 343/01), the Company is subject to fulfill the Guidelines of the Good Distribution Practices of medical products for human use.
 
Decahedron received its Wholesale Distribution Authorization for human use on November 7, 2013, from the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in accordance with Regulation 18 of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/1916) and it is subject to the provisions of those Regulations and the Medicines Act 1971. This License will continue to remain in force from the date of issue by the Licensing Authority unless cancelled, suspended, revoked or varied as to the period of its validity or relinquished by the authorization holder.
 
Our subsidiary, SkyPharm, is ISO 9001 certified for a management system for the trade and distribution of pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. As part of the certification process by the International Organization for Standardization, we need to be compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) adopted by the European Union in May 2018. GDPR applies to the processing of personal data of persons in the EU by a controller or processor neither of which apply to SkyPharm.

We have developed or acquired various proprietary products, licenses, processes, software, and other intellectual property that are used either to facilitate the conduct of our business or that are made available as products or services to customers.
 
At present, besides the above licenses we do not have any intellectual property or other licenses, including, but not limited to, patents, trademarks, franchises, concessions, and royalty agreements or other proprietary interests.
 
We rely on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and other parties to protect, among other things, trade secrets and other proprietary technology.

Distribution and Equity Agreement
 
On March 19, 2018, the Company entered into a Distribution and Equity Acquisition Agreement (the “Distribution and Equity Acquisition Agreement”) with Marathon Global Inc. (“Marathon”), a company incorporated in the Province of Ontario, Canada. Marathon was formed to be a global supplier of Cannabis, cannabidiol (CBD) and/or any Cannabis Extract products, extracts, ancillaries and derivatives (collectively, the “Products”). The Company was appointed the exclusive distributor of the Products initially throughout Europe and on a non-exclusive basis wherever else lawfully permitted. The Company has no present intention to distribute any Products under this Agreement in the United States or otherwise participate in cannabis operations in the United States. The Company intends to await further clarification from the U.S. Government on cannabis regulation prior to determining whether to enter the domestic market.

We have a team with a significant track record in the pharmaceutical business. In order to achieve our strategic objectives, we have, and will remain, focused on hiring and retaining a highly skilled management team that has extensive experience and specific skill sets relating to the sales, selection, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products. We intend to continue our efforts to build and expand this team as we grow our business. No assurances can be given that the Company will be able to retain any additional persons.
 
Product Insurance
 
We have insurance in place for our warehouses and the products in stock against any damage or theft, but we do not insure our products after the sale, since we are working under an Ex-works policy, and thus our clients are responsible for the transportation and the insurance of the products against any damage. In the future, we will continue to reevaluate our decision and may purchase product liability insurance to cover some of or all of our product liability risk.

Research and Development Expenditures
