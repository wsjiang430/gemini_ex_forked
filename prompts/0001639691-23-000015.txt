Item 1. Business
Description of the Business and Background 
LivaNova PLC, headquartered in London (collectively with its subsidiaries, the “Company,” “LivaNova,” “we” or “our”), is a global medical device company. We design, develop, manufacture and sell products and therapies that are consistent with our mission to provide hope for patients and their families through innovative medical technologies, delivering life-changing improvements for both the Head and Heart. 
We were organized under the laws of England and Wales on February 20, 2015 for the purpose of facilitating the business combination of Cyberonics, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and Sorin S.p.A. (“Sorin”), a joint stock company organized under the laws of Italy. The business combination became effective in October 2015. LivaNova’s ordinary shares are listed for trading on the Nasdaq Global Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “LIVN.” 
Business Overview
LivaNova is comprised of three reportable segments: Cardiopulmonary, Neuromodulation and Advanced Circulatory Support (“ACS”), corresponding to our primary business units. “Other” includes corporate shared service expenses for finance, legal, human resources, information technology and corporate business development. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, “Other” also includes the results of our Heart Valve business, which was divested on June 1, 2021.
For further information regarding our reportable segments, historical financial information and our methodology for the presentation of financial results, please refer to “Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Cardiopulmonary
Our Cardiopulmonary segment is engaged in the development, production and sale of cardiopulmonary products, including heart-lung machines (“HLM”), oxygenators, autotransfusion systems, perfusion tubing systems, cannulae and other related accessories. It includes the development of the Essenz Perfusion System, our next-generation HLM and a patient monitor that delivers a patient-tailored approach, supporting data-driven decisions during cardiopulmonary bypass procedures. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we completed the first clinical cases using Essenz in two major centers in Europe.
Cardiopulmonary bypass is commonly used in many operations involving the heart. The technique enables the surgical team to oxygenate and circulate the patient's blood, thus allowing the surgeon to operate on the heart. The most commonly performed procedures requiring cardiopulmonary bypass are conventional coronary artery bypass grafting and valve surgeries. In such procedures, the patient is placed on an extracorporeal circulatory support system that temporarily functions as the patient’s heart and lungs and provides blood flow to the body. Our products include systems to enable cardiopulmonary bypass, including HLMs, oxygenators, autotransfusion systems, perfusion tubing sets, cannulae and accessories, as well as related equipment and disposables for autotransfusion and autologous blood washing for neonatal, pediatric and adult patients. Our primary cardiopulmonary products include: 
Heart-lung machines. The HLM product group includes HLMs, heater coolers, related cardiac surgery equipment and maintenance and technical services. HLMs temporarily take over the work of the heart and/or lungs, providing blood and oxygen to the body. HLMs are most often used during serious procedures that require the heart to be stopped. Heater coolers are used during surgeries to warm or cool patients as part of their care. They are especially important during surgeries involving the heart and lungs.
Oxygenators and perfusion tubing systems. The oxygenators product group, which includes oxygenators and other disposable devices for extracorporeal circulation, includes the Inspire systems. The Inspire range of products is comprised of 12 models and provides perfusionists with a customizable approach for the benefit of patients. Oxygenators exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood of patients during surgical procedures. An oxygenator is typically utilized by perfusionists during cardiac surgery in conjunction with a HLM. Oxygenators can also be utilized in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (“ECMO”).
Autotransfusion systems. One of the key elements for a complete blood management strategy is autologous blood transfusion. The autotransfusion product group facilitates the collection, processing and reinfusion of the patient’s own blood lost at the surgical site. 
Cannulae. Our cannulae product family is used to connect the extracorporeal circulation to the heart of the patient during cardiac surgery.
Neuromodulation 
Our Neuromodulation segment is engaged in the design, development and marketing of devices that deliver neuromodulation therapy for treating drug-resistant epilepsy (“DRE”) and difficult-to-treat depression (“DTD”). It also encompasses the development and management of clinical testing of our aura6000 System for treating obstructive sleep apnea (“OSA”) and, until recently, our VITARIA System which was intended to treat heart failure.
Our principal Neuromodulation product, the LivaNova Vagus Nerve Stimulation Therapy (“VNS Therapy”) System, is an implantable device authorized for the treatment of DRE and DTD. The VNS Therapy System consists of an implantable pulse generator and connective lead that stimulate the vagus nerve; surgical equipment to assist with the implant procedure; equipment and instruction manuals enabling a treating physician to set parameters for a patient’s pulse generator; and for epilepsy, magnets to manually suspend or induce nerve stimulation. The pulse generator and lead are surgically implanted in a subcutaneous pocket in the upper left chest area, generally during an out-patient procedure. The lead, which does not need to be removed to replace a generator with a depleted battery, is connected to the pulse generator and tunneled under the skin to the vagus nerve in the lower left side of the patient’s neck. Our aura6000 device for treating OSA stimulates the hypoglossal nerve, which in turn, engages certain muscles in the tongue to open the airway while a patient is sleeping.
Epilepsy
There are several broad types of treatment available to patients with epilepsy: multiple anti-seizure medications (“ASMs”); various forms of the ketogenic diet; vagus nerve stimulation (“VNS”); resective and ablative brain surgery; and intracranial neurostimulation. ASMs typically serve as a first-line treatment and are prescribed for virtually all patients diagnosed with epilepsy. After two anti-seizure medications fail to deliver seizure control, the epilepsy is characterized as drug-resistant, at which point, adjunctive non-drug options are considered, including VNS therapy, ketogenic diet, resective or ablative surgery and other neuromodulation therapies. 
In 1997, our VNS Therapy System was the first medical device treatment approved by the FDA for the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy, and today is the only neuromodulation device approved for use in DRE patients in the U.S. as young as four years of age with partial onset, or focal, seizures. Other worldwide regulatory bodies have also approved the VNS Therapy System for treating patients with DRE, many without age or seizure-type restrictions. Globally, VNS Therapy is the most widely reimbursed neuromodulation therapy available. In 2020, the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) expanded reimbursement for VNS Therapy use in the treatment of Dravet Syndrome and, in January 2022, expanded reimbursement for VNS Therapy use in the treatment of Lennox Gastaut Syndrome.
We distribute multiple VNS Therapy Systems for the treatment of epilepsy, including Model 103 (Demipulse), Model 104 (Demipulse Duo), Model 106 (AspireSR), Model 1000 (SenTiva) and Model 1000D (SenTiva Duo) pulse generators. Our AspireSR and SenTiva generators provide the traditional benefits of VNS Therapy but add an additional stimulation capability: closed loop stimulation (AutoStim™) which responds to detection of changes in heart rate potentially indicative of a seizure. The SenTiva generator is the smallest and lightest VNS device capable of delivering responsive therapy for epilepsy and includes the additional flexibility of our Scheduled Programming and Day & Night Programming capabilities. In 2017, VNS Therapy devices were FDA approved for expanded magnetic resonance imaging (“MRI”) access while similar CE Mark approval followed shortly thereafter. Currently, SenTiva, AspireHC and AspireSR models of VNS Therapy technology provide for this expanded MRI access. 
Depression
In 2005, the FDA approved the VNS Therapy System for the adjunctive treatment of chronic or recurrent depression for patients 18 years or older who are experiencing a major depressive episode and have not had an adequate response to four or more antidepressant treatments. In 2007, the United States (“U.S.”) CMS issued a national non-coverage determination (“NCD”) within the U.S. with respect to reimbursement of the VNS Therapy System for patients with DTD, significantly limiting access to this therapeutic option for most patients. In 2020, our VNS Therapy System, Symmetry received CE mark approval for the treatment of DTD.
In 2017, the American Journal of Psychiatry published the results of the longest and largest naturalistic study (the “D23 study”) on treatments for patients experiencing chronic and severe DTD. The findings showed that the addition of the VNS Therapy System to traditional treatment is effective in significantly reducing symptoms of depression and well tolerated compared with traditional treatment alone. Following publication of the D23 study, we requested CMS to reconsider its previous NCD, and in 2018, CMS published a tracking sheet to reconsider its NCD.
In 2019, CMS produced a final decision providing coverage for Medicare beneficiaries through Coverage with Evidence Development (“CED”) when offered in a CMS-approved, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with a follow-up 
duration of at least one year, as well as coverage of VNS Therapy device replacement. The CED also includes the possibility to extend the study to a prospective longitudinal registry.
In 2019, CMS accepted the protocol for our RECOVER clinical study and the first patient was enrolled. RECOVER may include up to 500 unipolar and up to 500 bipolar patients at a maximum of 100 sites in the United States in the randomized part of the trial and may include up to an additional 5,800 patients in an open label registry.
In 2020, we announced a research collaboration with Verily, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc., to capture clinical biomarkers of depression within our RECOVER clinical study. Using technology and analytics by way of the Verily Study Watch and related Verily mobile phone application, LivaNova and Verily aim to gather quantitative data to further understand depressive episodes and a patient’s response to treatment. These complementary approaches are expected to help investigators better understand the impact of depression and its treatment on study participants’ lives in a more objective and multi-dimensional manner. In 2021, LivaNova and Verily announced that the first patient had been enrolled in their collaborative UNCOVER study, a subset of the RECOVER study. 
In March 2022, LivaNova announced the 250th unipolar depression patient was implanted in the RECOVER clinical study. This key milestone preceded conducting the first interim analysis. The study was designed with frequent interim analyses, which occur every 25 patients, to be conducted by an independent Statistical Analysis Committee. The interim analysis assesses if predictive probability of success has been reached for the unipolar cohort of the study, at which point the randomized controlled trial (“RCT”) enrollment will cease and future patients will be enrolled into the prospective open label longitudinal study for that cohort. After the last patient enrolled into the RCT has completed 12 months of follow-up, a final analysis will be conducted on the complete dataset for that respective cohort. The trial, if successful, will be used to support a peer-reviewed article and reconsideration of reimbursement for VNS Therapy by CMS for the treatment of DTD.
Obstructive Sleep Apnea
In 2018, we acquired full ownership of ImThera, a privately held, emerging-growth company developing an implantable neurostimulation device system for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea. The device stimulates the hypoglossal nerve, which in turn, engages certain muscles in the tongue in order to open the airway while a patient is sleeping.
In 2021, LivaNova received approval from the FDA to proceed with its investigational device exemption clinical study, Treating Obstructive Sleep Apnea using Targeted Hypoglossal Neurostimulation (“OSPREY”), and the first patient was implanted in March 2022. The OSPREY study seeks to confirm the safety and effectiveness of the aura6000 System. 
Heart Failure
The VITARIA System was intended to treat heart failure through VNS. In 2018, after completion of pilot studies outside the U.S., we announced the first successful implantation of the VITARIA System in a patient randomized in the ANTHEM-HFrEF clinical trial, an international, multi-center, randomized trial (adaptive sample size) to evaluate the VITARIA System for the treatment of advanced heart failure. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we randomized the 500th patient in the trial which triggered the second interim analysis. The independent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (“DSMC”) evaluated safety, a trend toward the primary endpoint and success in the three functional endpoints. This analysis determined that the U.S. FDA early filing conditions were not met, and the DSMC recommended that enrollment continue in accordance with the current study protocol. However, we conducted further evaluation of the study data and concluded that such data did not demonstrate a sufficiently strong positive impact on functional or mortality endpoints and that it was unlikely that the continuation of the study would demonstrate such an impact. As a result, on February 22, 2023, we announced that we are stopping enrollment in the ANTHEM-HFrEF clinical trial, beginning the process to close the clinical study and winding down our heart failure program.
Advanced Circulatory Support 
Our ACS segment is engaged in the development, production and sale of leading-edge temporary life support products. Our ACS products, which comprise the LifeSPARC platform and ProtekDuo cannula, simplify temporary extracorporeal cardiopulmonary life support solutions for critically ill patients. The LifeSPARC platform includes a common compact console and pump that provides temporary support for emergent rescue patients in a variety of settings. Designed for ease of use, the system offers power and versatility for multi-disciplinary programs to support more patients in more places. The platform is accompanied by four specialized and ready-to-deploy kits, each designed to support diverse cannulation strategies. In November 2022, the FDA approved our LifeSPARC platform for ECMO. This approval allows for our LifeSPARC platform to be used for ECMO beyond six hours for patients in acute respiratory failure or acute cardiopulmonary failure, including but not limited to those receiving treatment for COVID-19.
We previously owned a 3% equity interest in ALung Technologies, Inc. (“ALung”), a privately-held medical device company focused on creating advanced medical devices for treating respiratory failure. In May 2022, we acquired the remaining 97% of equity interests. For additional information, please refer to “Note 4. Business Combinations” and “Note 8. Goodwill and Intangible Assets” in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As a result of the ALung transaction, our ACS segment also includes the Hemolung Respiratory Assist System (“Hemolung RAS”), which is the only FDA-cleared platform designed specifically for low-flow extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal for acute respiratory failure. 
In August 2022, CMS approved a New Technology Add-on Payment (“NTAP”) for our Hemolung RAS for in-patient care. The NTAP designation is awarded to novel medical technologies and services supported by clinical evidence that are expected to substantially improve the diagnosis or treatment of Medicare beneficiaries.
Research and Development (“R&D”)
Our markets are subject to rapid technological advances, and product improvement, software advancements and innovation are necessary to maintain market leadership. We direct our R&D efforts toward maintaining or achieving technological leadership in each of the markets we serve to help ensure that patients using our devices and therapies receive the most advanced and effective treatment possible. We remain committed to developing technological enhancements and new uses for existing products and less invasive and new technologies for new and emerging markets to address unmet patient needs. We initiate and participate in many clinical trials each year as the demand for clinical and economic evidence remains high. We also strive for development activities to help reduce patient care costs and the length of hospital stays in the future. 
We work to continue to identify innovative technologies and continually assess the ability of our R&D programs to deliver economic value to the customer. Our current R&D expenses consist of product design and development efforts, including in relation to software and technology, clinical study programs and regulatory activities, which are essential to our strategic portfolio initiatives. 
Patents and Licenses 
We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and non-disclosure and non-competition agreements to protect our intellectual property. We generally file patent applications in the U.S. and countries where patent protection for our technology is appropriate and available. As of December 31, 2022, we held more than 840 issued patents worldwide, with approximately 285 pending patent applications that cover various aspects of our technology. Patents typically have a 20-year term from the application filing date. In addition, we hold exclusive and non-exclusive licenses to a variety of third-party technologies covered by patents and pending patent applications. There can be no assurance that pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents, that patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to protect our technology or to provide us with a competitive advantage. We have also obtained certain trademarks and trade names for our products and maintain certain details about our processes, products and strategies as trade secrets. In the aggregate, we consider these intellectual property assets to be of material importance to our business segments and operations. We regularly review third-party patents and patent applications in an effort to protect our intellectual property and avoid disputes over proprietary rights. 
We rely on non-disclosure and non-competition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary technology. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached or will be enforceable, in particular due to new proposed regulation in the U.S., that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge.
For additional information, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, under the section entitled “We are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and other proprietary rights against others.”
Markets and Distribution Methods
The three largest markets for our medical devices are the U.S., Europe and the Asia-Pacific region (“APAC”). We sell most of our medical devices through direct sales representatives in the U.S. and a combination of direct sales representatives and independent distributors in markets outside the U.S.
Our marketing and sales strategy is focused on rapid, cost-effective delivery of high-quality products to a diverse group of customers worldwide, including perfusionists, neurologists, neurosurgeons and other physicians, hospitals and other medical institutions and healthcare providers. To achieve this objective, we maintain a highly knowledgeable and dedicated sales staff that is able to foster strong relationships with our broad range of customers. We cultivate and maintain close working relationships with professionals in the medical industry. These relationships provide us with a detailed understanding of therapeutic and diagnostic developments, trends and emerging opportunities, which enable us to respond to the changing needs of providers and patients. We actively participate in medical meetings and conduct comprehensive training and educational activities to enhance our presence in the medical communities we serve. We believe that these activities also contribute to advancing healthcare professionals’ expertise. 
Due to the emphasis on cost-effectiveness in healthcare delivery, the current trend among hospitals and other medical device customers is to consolidate into larger purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power. As a result, customer transactions have become increasingly complex. Enhanced purchasing power may also lead to pressure on pricing and an increase in the use of preferred vendors. Our customer base continues to evolve to reflect such economic changes across the geographic markets we serve.
Competition and Industry
We compete in the medical device market with sales in more than 100 countries. Technological advances and scientific discoveries can cause rapid change in this market. Our competitors across our product portfolio range from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers offering a limited selection of specialized products. In addition, we face competition from providers of alternative medical therapies, such as pharmaceutical companies and providers of cannabis derived products, among others.
Product problems, physician advisories, regulatory safety alerts and publications about our products, or competitor products, can cause major shifts in industry market share, reflecting the importance of product quality, product efficacy and quality systems in the medical device industry. In addition, because of developments in managed care, economically motivated customers, consolidation among healthcare providers, increased competition and declining reimbursement rates, we may be increasingly required to compete on the basis of price. In order to continue to compete effectively, we must continue to create or acquire advanced technology, incorporate this technology into proprietary products, obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, maintain high-quality manufacturing processes and successfully market these products. 
Our primary medical device competitors in the Cardiopulmonary, Neuromodulation and Advanced Circulatory Support product groups are Terumo Medical Corporation, Maquet Medical Systems, Medtronic plc, Haemonetics Corporation, NeuroPace, Inc. and Abbott Laboratories, Inc., although not all competitors are present in all product lines. 
Production, Quality Systems and Raw Materials
We manufacture a majority of our products at nine manufacturing facilities located in Italy, Germany, the U.S., Brazil and Australia. We purchase raw materials and many of the components used in our manufacturing facilities from numerous suppliers in various countries. For quality assurance, sole source availability or cost effectiveness purposes, we may procure certain components and raw materials from a sole supplier. We work closely with our suppliers to ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability, minimize the instances in which we rely on a sole supplier and take other countermeasures to reduce our supply chain risk, but, like many companies, have experienced and continue to experience supply chain delays and interruptions, labor shortages, inflationary pressures and logistical issues. We use quality systems in the design, production, warehousing and distribution of our products to ensure our products are safe and effective. In addition, we utilize environmental management systems and safety programs to protect the environment and our employees. For example, all of our manufacturing facilities are certified ISO 13485. Additionally, our Mirandola, Italy plant is certified ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 and our Munich, Germany plant is certified ISO 14001. For additional information related to our manufacturing facilities, refer to “Item 2. Properties” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Government Regulation and Other Considerations
Our medical devices are subject to extensive government regulation by numerous government agencies, both within and outside the U.S. To varying degrees, each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the research, development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, pre-market clearance or approval, marketing, distribution, advertising, promotion, record keeping, reporting, tracking, and importing and exporting of our products. Our business is also affected by patient privacy and security laws, cost containment initiatives, and environmental health and safety laws and regulations worldwide.
The laws applicable to us are subject to changing and evolving interpretations, and we continue to monitor such shifts. The Company believes it is in compliance with such laws and regulations, and while the impact of regulatory changes cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not expect compliance to have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s earnings, competitive position or estimated capital expenditures. However, if a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we and our officers and employees could be subject to severe civil and criminal penalties, including substantial fines and damages, and exclusion from participation as a supplier of products to beneficiaries covered by government programs, among other potential enforcement actions. 
Product Approval and Monitoring
Many countries where we sell our products subject our medical devices to their own approval and requirements regarding performance, safety and quality. Each medical device we seek to distribute commercially in the U.S., for example, must receive 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval (“PMA”) from the FDA, unless specifically exempted by the agency. The 510(k) process, also known as pre-market notification, requires us to demonstrate that our new medical device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed medical device. The PMA process, which is more costly and rigorous than the 510(k) process, requires us to demonstrate independently that a medical device is safe and effective for its intended use. One or more clinical studies may be required to support a 510(k) application and are almost always required to support a PMA application.
The European Union (“EU”) established a single regulatory approval process, according to which a “Conformité Européenne” (French for “European Conformity”) or CE Mark certifies conformity with all of the legal requirements of the regulatory process. To obtain a CE Mark, defined products must meet minimum standards of performance, safety and quality (i.e., the essential requirements), and then, according to their classification, comply with one or more of a selection of conformity assessment routes. To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements, we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. As a general rule, demonstration of conformity of medical devices and their manufacturers with the essential requirements must be based on, among other things, the evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use. The competent authorities of the EU countries separately regulate the clinical research for medical devices and the market surveillance of products placed on the market, and manufacturers with CE marked devices are subject to regular inspections to monitor compliance with the applicable directives and essential requirements. In 2017, the EU published its Medical Device Regulation (“Reg MDR”), which imposed significantly more premarket and post-market requirements for medical devices upon conclusion of a three-year implementation period. We have initiated a plan of action to obtain the appropriate approvals for our products and intend to be fully compliant prior to the May 2024 deadline, though we understand there is a proposal to extend the compliance deadline.
We are also required to comply with the regulations of every other country where we commercialize products before we can launch or maintain new products in the market. To be sold in Japan, for example, our medical devices must undergo thorough safety examinations and demonstrate medical efficacy from the Japanese government through the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, before they are granted approval. In China, regulatory requirements are becoming more stringent, with the China National Medical Product Administration recently increasing regulatory requirements to market and maintain products in China. Many countries require that product approvals be recertified on a regular basis, generally every four to five years. The recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and, where needed, conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance. Where recertification applications are required, they must be approved in order to continue selling our products in those countries.
The global regulatory environment is increasingly stringent and unpredictable. Several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years, and other countries have expanded, or plan to expand, their existing regulations. While some regulatory bodies have pursued harmonization of global regulations, requirements continue to differ significantly among countries. We expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve, which could impact the cost, approval lead time, and ultimately, our ability to maintain existing approvals or obtain future approvals for our products.
Product and Promotional Restrictions
Both before and after we release a product for commercial distribution, we have ongoing responsibilities under various laws and regulations governing medical devices. The FDA and other regulatory agencies in and outside the U.S. review our design and manufacturing practices, labeling, record keeping, and required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices. We are also subject to periodic inspections for compliance with applicable quality system regulations, which govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging and servicing of finished medical devices intended for human use. In addition, the FDA and other U.S. regulatory bodies monitor the manner in which we promote and advertise our products. Although physicians are permitted to 
use their medical judgment to prescribe medical devices for indications other than those cleared or approved by the FDA, we are prohibited from promoting products for such “off-label” uses and can only market our products for cleared or approved uses. 
Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may limit our ability to market and sell our products effectively, limit our ability to obtain future premarket approvals or result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations. For additional information, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, under the section entitled “Our products are subject to complex laws and regulations, and failure to obtain product approvals, clearance or reimbursement may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.”
Governmental Trade Regulations 
The sale and shipment of our products and services across international borders, as well as the purchase of components and products from international sources, subject us to extensive governmental trade regulations. Many countries control the export and re-export of goods, technology and services for public health, national security, regional stability, antiterrorism and other reasons. Some governments may also impose economic sanctions against certain countries, persons or entities. In certain circumstances, governmental authorities may require that we obtain an approval before we export or re-export goods, technology or services to certain destinations, to certain end-users and for certain end-uses. Because we are subject to extensive regulations in the countries in which we operate, we are subject to the risk that laws and regulations could change in a way that would expose us to additional costs, penalties or liabilities.
We also sell and provide goods, technology and services to agents, representatives and distributors who may export such items to customers and end-users, and if these third parties violate applicable export control or economic sanctions laws or regulations when engaging in transactions involving our products, we may be subject to varying degrees of liability depending on the extent of our participation in the transaction. The activities of these third parties may cause disruption or delays in the distribution and sale of our products or result in restrictions being placed on our international distribution and sales of products, which may materially impact our business activities.
Patient Privacy and Security Laws 
We are subject to various laws worldwide that protect the security and confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient medical records, and that restrict the use and disclosure of patient health information. Privacy standards are becoming increasingly strict; enforcement actions and financial penalties related to privacy issues in the EU are growing, and new privacy and data residency laws and restrictions are being passed in other countries including the U.S., China, and Brazil. The management of cross-border transfers of information among and outside of EU member countries is becoming more complex, which may complicate our business and clinical research activities, as well as product offerings that involve transmission or use of patient health information. We continue our efforts to comply with those requirements and to adapt our business processes to those standards.
In the U.S., the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) and their respective implementing regulations impose specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. We are deemed to operate as a business associate to covered entities in certain instances. In those cases, the patient data that we receive may include protected health information, as defined under HIPAA. Enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt regular operations of our business. In addition, state laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance and data protection efforts. For additional information, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, under the section entitled “Cyber-attacks or other disruptions to our information technology systems could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, fines, harm to our competitive position and loss of reputation.”
In the EU, Regulation 2016/679 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) came into effect in May 2018. One of the strictest and most comprehensive data privacy laws in the world, the GDPR, among other things, introduced proactive compliance measures, such as the requirement to carry out a Privacy Impact Assessment, Data Transfer Impact Assessment, and appoint a Data Protection Officer in organizations where health data is processed on a “large scale.” Although “large scale” is not defined, it is likely that clinical trials involving substantial numbers of patients (or healthy volunteers if applicable) would mean that such requirements apply to us. In addition, the administrative fines that can be levied are significantly increased, the 
maximum being the higher of €20 million (approximately $21.4 million), or 4% of our total worldwide revenue in the previous financial year.
Cost Containment Initiatives 
Government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation, competitive pricing, bidding and tender mechanics, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments and managed-care arrangements are continuing in many countries where we do business. These changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective medical devices and therapies. Government programs, private healthcare insurance and managed-care plans have attempted to control costs by limiting the extent of coverage or amount of reimbursement available for particular procedures or treatments, tying reimbursement to outcomes, shifting to population health management, and other mechanisms designed to constrain utilization and contain costs. Hospitals, which purchase implants, are also seeking to reduce costs through a variety of mechanisms, including, for example, creating centralized purchasing functions that set pricing and, in some cases, limit the number of vendors that can participate in the purchasing program. Hospitals are also aligning their interests with those of physicians through employment and other arrangements, such as gainsharing, whereby a hospital agrees with physicians to share certain realized cost savings resulting from the physicians’ collective change in practice patterns, such as standardization of devices where medically appropriate, and participation in affordable care organizations. Such alignment has created increasing levels of price sensitivity among customers for our products. 
Some third-party payers must also approve coverage and set reimbursement levels for new or innovative devices or therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use the medical devices or therapies. Even though a new medical device may be cleared for commercial distribution, we may find limited demand for the device until coverage and sufficient reimbursement levels have been obtained from governmental and private third-party payers. In addition, some private third-party payers require that certain procedures or the use of certain products be authorized in advance as a condition of coverage. 
As a result of our manufacturing efficiencies, cost controls and other cost-savings initiatives, we believe we are well-positioned to respond to changes resulting from this worldwide trend toward cost containment; however, uncertainty remains as to the nature of any future legislation or other reforms, making it difficult for us to predict the potential impact of cost-containment trends on future operating results. 
Applicability of Anti-Corruption Laws and Regulations
Our worldwide business is subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the “FCPA”), the UK Bribery Act of 2010 (the “UK Bribery Act”) and other anti-corruption laws and regulations applicable in the jurisdictions where we operate. The FCPA can be used to prosecute companies in the U.S. for arrangements with physicians or other parties outside the U.S. if the physician or party is a government official of another country and prohibited payments are made to obtain or retain business. The UK Bribery Act prohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both public and private sectors. There are similar laws and regulations applicable to us outside the U.S. and the UK, all of which are subject to evolving interpretations. For additional information, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, under the section entitled “The failure to comply with anti-bribery laws could materially adversely affect our business and result in civil and/or criminal sanctions.”
Environmental Regulation and Management 
We are subject to various environmental laws, directives and regulations both in the U.S. and abroad. These laws and regulations could lead to increased environmental compliance expenditures, increased energy and raw materials costs and new and/or additional investment in designs and technologies. Like other medical device companies, our manufacturing and other operations involve the use, storage and transportation of substances regulated under environmental health and safety laws, including those related to the transportation of hazardous substances. To the best of our knowledge at this time, we do not believe that compliance with environmental protection laws related to our current operations, including but not limited to the Saluggia site as referenced in “Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies” in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, will have a material impact on our financial position or liquidity. In addition, as noted in Note 14 to such financial statements, we are engaged in litigation with respect to historical remediation claims at sites operated by subsidiaries of SNIA, unrelated to our current operations. For more information, see “Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies” to such financial statements.
We believe that sound environmental, health and safety performance contribute to our competitive strength while benefiting our customers, stockholders and employees. We are focused on continuous improvement in these areas by reducing pollution, depletion of natural resources and our overall environmental footprint. Specifically, we work to improve our energy and resource usage, ultimately seeking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and waste. 
Health Care Fraud and Abuse Laws 
We are subject to U.S. federal and state government healthcare regulation and enforcement and government regulations and enforcement in other countries in which we conduct our business. The federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to a person to induce the purchase, order, lease, or recommendation of a good or service for which payment may be made in whole or part under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid, unless the arrangement fits within one of several statutory exemptions or regulatory “safe harbors.” Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may result in civil monetary penalties up to $100,000 for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved. Violations can also result in criminal penalties, including criminal fines of up to $100,000 and imprisonment for up to 10 years. Finally, violations can result in exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.
In addition to the Anti-Kickback Statute, many states have their own anti-kickback laws. Often, these laws closely follow the language of the federal law, although they do not always have the same exceptions or safe harbors. In some states, these anti-kickback laws apply with respect to all payers, including commercial health insurance companies.
Additionally, violations of the U.S. False Claims Act (the “False Claims Act”) can result in significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The U.S. federal government utilizes the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant financial liability, to investigate and prosecute device and biotechnology companies in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. The U.S. government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion-dollar settlements under the False Claims Act, in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. Given the U.S. government’s success with prosecuting claims under the False Claims Act, we anticipate that the U.S. government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws. 
HIPAA includes federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors; knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program; willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense; and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
There has also been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. We are subject, for example, to the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires us to report certain payments and other transfers of value we make to U.S. licensed physicians or U.S. teaching hospitals annually. Any failure to comply with such laws and regulations hold the potential for criminal and civil financial penalties.
The evolving commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, and exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act of 1934
Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act requires issuers to disclose in their annual reports, among other things, certain types of dealings with Iran and other entities, including transactions or dealing with government-owned entities, even when those activities are lawful and do not involve U.S. persons. Two of our non-U.S. subsidiaries currently sell medical devices, including cardiopulmonary and neuromodulation products, to distributors and non-governmental organizations in Iran to support patient care in that country. We have limited visibility into the identity of these distributors’ and non-governmental organizations’ customers in Iran. It is possible that their customers include entities, such as government-owned hospitals or sub-distributors, that are owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the Iranian government. To the best of our knowledge at this time, we do not have any contracts or commercial arrangements with the Iranian government or other relevant entities.
Our gross revenues and net profits attributable to the above-mentioned Iranian activities were $0.4 million and $0.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, and $4.9 million and $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively. 
We believe our activities are consistent with applicable law, including U.S., EU, and other applicable sanctions laws, though such laws are complex and continue to evolve rapidly. We intend to continue our business in Iran.
Human Capital Management
Our approximately 2,900 employees worldwide are crucial in our mission to provide hope to our patients and their families through delivering life-changing medical innovation for the head and the heart. In doing so, we seek to execute our business and encourage our employees to live our five core values: patients first, meaningful innovation, act with agility, commitment to quality and integrity, and collaborative culture. These values are how we evaluate ourselves and, ultimately, achieve success as an organization. They are deeply embedded in our culture, and we continually share stories embodying these values throughout the organization, by way of emailed videos, virtual and in-person town halls and leadership meetings. Our values inspire our good citizenship and how we conduct our business responsibly and sustainably while interacting with our communities, employees and the environment.
Compensation and Benefits
In order to meet the needs of our patients and customers, we endeavor to attract, retain, develop and reward exceptional talent. We have been successful in attracting talent due, in large part, to our proactive recruitment strategies, competitive compensation and benefits, collaborative and rewarding work environment, professional training and development programs for managers and employees, and health and wellness measures. Our packages include, depending on jurisdiction, annual bonuses, stock awards, pensions, health benefits and health programs, paid time off and parental leave, financial assistance for education-related purposes, flexible schedules, remote working, and employee stock purchase plans, among others.
Culture
Maintaining a culture that embodies our values and mission is of the utmost importance. We aim to foster a culture where learning is continuous, and open and direct employee communication is valued. Accordingly, we regularly conduct an anonymous employee survey called LivaNova4You to help measure the overall engagement and satisfaction level of our team. The survey provides us with actionable data which allows our senior leadership to understand and identify potential opportunities for improvement. 
Our Q4 2021 survey results demonstrated satisfaction and growth in collaboration, including employees showing high trust and respect for each other; an increased feeling of recognition on a job well done; empowerment and the feeling of being sufficiently challenged; and flexibility in coming up with new and innovative ways to work. Employees also acknowledged an improvement in the tools and opportunities for advancement, one of our highest improving scores as compared to the previous survey. In response to feedback from the survey results, we committed to address workload, clarify internal development processes, and increase understanding around the Company’s benefits as they relate to employees. Throughout 2022, we implemented programs in these three key areas in response, focusing on reducing workload with the help of digitization and robotic process automation; career pathing, i.e., connecting performance, interests and potential with meaningful development and succession planning; and developing and launching LivaNova’s employee value proposition, i.e., how we market to prospective talent and retain in a competitive job market. Our next survey will be distributed in the spring of 2023.
Development and Training
We attract, develop and retain employees who are aligned with our mission and values. In doing so, our talent strategy considers performance, values, accountability, transparency and differentiation, all of which are evaluated annually within the context of our performance management system. All employees undergo a robust onboarding program, and at any time, employees have access to a large offering of training on ethics and integrity, quality, product and other key topics and functions in the organization. Meanwhile, newly hired operators are onboarded and trained per requirements and processes specific to their jurisdiction and the product that is manufactured in their locations. Thereafter, they receive ongoing technical training to ensure they maintain excellent standards for production and manufacturing. In 2022, we expanded our suite of trainings to include the LivaNova Business System Academy which aims to teach lean methodologies and practices, i.e., promoting the flow of value to the customer through continuous improvement and respect for people. 
An important factor in the Company’s future growth is our ability to develop and retain leaders. Our annual talent review process engages our employees to establish development plans and document their skills and capabilities, while managers assess employee potential, create succession plans, and identify possible career path opportunities. In 2022, we launched the LivaNova Commercial Academy, which focuses on the development of current and future leaders by way of a leadership bootcamp that covers real world scenarios, best practices and self-reflection modules over the course of fifteen working sessions. In addition, our own LivaNova University offers both mandatory and on-demand leadership, business strategy and functional skills courses and learning paths. 
Finally, we offer internships and apprenticeships across functions around the globe which can, and do, lead to full-time employment. We believe in continuing education and development regardless of nationality and origin, which is why we partner with organizations to find new talent with hopes of welcoming future, full-time employees.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
The success of LivaNova thrives on the diversity of perspective, thought, experience and background within our workforce. We recognize the value in fostering a work environment that is culturally diverse and inclusive and strive to provide a workplace free of harassment or discrimination. Accordingly, we closely monitor our gender metrics at the Board, Executive and senior leadership level on a regular basis. As of December 31, 2022, we had ten Directors on our Board, of whom 40% are female and 60% are male. Similarly, the Executive Team at the end of 2022 consisted of 11 individuals, approximately 27% of whom are female and approximately 73% are male. Of our senior leadership team, which includes the executive team, vice presidents and directors, approximately 32% are female and approximately 68% are male. Finally, as of December 31, 2022, of our approximately 2,900 employees, approximately 52% are female and approximately 48% are male. Our strategy for accelerating diversity begins with creating new ways to find extraordinary talent, and examples of our efforts include accurately mapping the talent market, targeting historically black colleges and universities, creating job postings that attract highly qualified diverse candidates, expanding the diversity within our interview panels and guiding interviewers to conduct a fair interview process.
In addition, we have a variety of diversity affinity initiatives that span the globe, with a mission to empower an environment where conversations of diversity and inclusion develop a culture of belonging. In July 2022, we launched the “Global Women’s Network”, a group consisting of female employees across the globe who convened to discuss topics that unite and celebrate the strength of our diversity. In addition, the LivaNova Women's Network, a mentorship program created by women and for women, facilitates pairings between mentors and mentees across all regions. Topics range from career and financial advice to performance management and connection to the Company’s strategy. These programs provide members with new perspectives, more personalized development and an opportunity to network with other women across the organization, thereby contributing to a better corporate culture based on strong, collaborative relationships and continuous opportunities to grow and develop.
In October 2022, we issued our Diversity and Inclusion statement: We embrace diverse perspectives, experiences and backgrounds, knowing they enrich our collaborative culture and drive our success as a company. Diversity and inclusion creates trust and a deeper sense of belonging to our LivaNova community, uniting us to make a meaningful difference in the lives of patients worldwide. The statement was distributed to all leadership teams in the company to increase awareness, create engagement, and induce discussions about the company’s diversity and inclusion achievements and suggestions on where we can improve.
Health and Safety
We are committed to the safety and well-being of our employees. We rely on our environmental, health and safety management systems as well as our managers to oversee and ensure health and safety at their respective sites and foster a workplace culture to achieve that end. For onsite employees, we continue to follow safety measures including requesting that those with COVID-19 or exposure thereto, follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) or similar local recommendations prior to returning to work. For the remainder of our employees, we offer hybrid working patterns, allowing our employees across the globe – who can work from home – the flexibility to balance their personal and professional needs. We continue to actively monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and its variants and respond based on guidance from U.S. and global health organizations, relevant governmental guidance, and evolving practices.
Seasonality
The number of medical procedures incorporating our products is generally lower during the summer months, particularly in European countries, due to summer vacation schedules.
