ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview
 
Our mission is to provide simple useful services that help people unlock the power of the Internet.
 
We accomplish this by reducing the complexity of our customers’ experience as they access the Internet (at home or on the go) and while using Internet services such as domain name registration, email and other Internet services. We are organized, managed and report our financial results as two segments, Network Access Services and Domain Services, which are differentiated primarily by their services, the markets they serve and the regulatory environments in which they operate.
 
Our management regularly reviews our operating results on a consolidated basis, principally to make decisions about how we utilize our resources and to measure our consolidated operating performance. To assist us in forecasting growth and to help us monitor the effectiveness of our operational strategies, our management regularly reviews revenue for each of our service offerings in order to gain more depth and understanding of the key business metrics driving our business. Accordingly, we report Network Access Services and Domain Services revenue separately.
 
Network Access Services
 
Network Access Services includes mobile, fixed high-speed Internet access services and other revenue sources, including billing solutions to small Internet service providers (“ISPs”).
 
Our primary mobile service offering (“Ting Mobile”) is mainly distributed through the Ting website and to a lesser extent certain third-party retail stores and on-line retailers. We generate revenues from the sale of retail telephony services, mobile phone hardware and related accessories to individuals and small businesses through the Ting website. Ting Mobile’s primary focus is providing simple and easy to use services, including simple value pricing, in particular for multi-line accounts, and superior customer care.
 
The Company also operates other MVNO brands, Zipsim and Always Online Wireless (collectively referred to as the “Roam Mobility brands”). Roam Mobility operates as a MVNO on the same nationwide Global System for Mobile communications (“GSM”) network as Ting Mobile and distributes through third-party retail stores and product branded websites. The primary focus of the Roam Mobility brands is to offer affordable roaming service to international travellers.
 
The Company also derives revenue from the sale of fixed high-speed Internet access (“Ting Internet”) in select communities, including towns in North Carolina, Maryland, Idaho, Colorado and Virginia. Our primarily sales channel of Ting Internet is through the Ting website. The primary focus of Ting Internet is to provide reliable Gigabit Internet services to consumer and business customers.
 
Revenues from Ting Mobile and Ting Internet are generated in the United States and are provided on a monthly basis with no fixed contract term. Revenues from Roam Mobility are generated in the United States, and Canada on a prepaid usage basis with no fixed contract terms.

Domain Services
 
Domain Services includes wholesale and retail domain name registration services, value added services and portfolio services derived through our OpenSRS, eNom and Hover brands. We earn revenues primarily from the registration fees charged to resellers in connection with new, renewed and transferred domain name registrations. In addition, we earn revenues from the sale of retail domain name registration and email services to individuals and small businesses; and by making our portfolio of domain names available for sale or lease. Domain Services revenues are attributed to the country in which the contract originates, primarily Canada and the United States.
 
Our primary distribution channel is a global network of approximately 37,000 resellers that operate in over 150 countries and who typically provide their customers, the end-users of Internet-based services, with solutions for establishing and maintaining an online presence. Our primary focus is serving the needs of this network of resellers by providing the broadest portfolio of gTLD and the country code top-level domain (“ccTLD”) options and related services, a white-label platform that facilitates the provisioning and management of domain names, a powerful Application Program Interface, easy-to-use interfaces, comprehensive management and reporting tools, and proactive and attentive customer service. Our services are integral to the solutions that our resellers deliver to their customers. We provide “second tier” support to our resellers by email, chat and phone in the event resellers experience issues or problems with our services. In addition, our Network Operating Center proactively monitors all services and network infrastructure to address deficiencies before customer services are impacted.
 
We believe that the underlying platforms for our services are among the most mature, reliable and functional reseller-oriented provisioning and management platforms in our industry, and we continue to refine, evolve and improve these services for both resellers and end-users. Our business model is characterized primarily by non-refundable, up-front payments, which lead to recurring revenue and positive operating cash flow.
 
Our wholesale domain name registration services, primarily branded as OpenSRS and eNom, derives revenue from its Domain Service and from providing value-added services. The OpenSRS and eNom Domain Services manage 23.3 million domain names under the Tucows and eNom ICANN registrar accreditations and for other registrars under their own accreditations, which has decreased by 4.4 million domain names since December 31, 2017. The reduction from prior year is primarily due to the bulk transfer of approximately 2.8 million domain names to Namecheap’s credentials, which occurred in several bulk transfers throughout 2018.  As a result of the bulk transfers of domain names to Namecheap the Company recognized, on an accelerated basis, $16.9 million of revenue and $16.7 million of cost of revenues in the year ended December 31, 2018 related to previously deferred revenue and deferred prepaid registry fees. The remaining domain names to be transferred to Namecheap of approximately 0.2 million names, as defined under a settlement agreement between the Company and Namecheap, are expected to be transferred to Namecheap in the first quarter of 2019.
 
Our value-added services include hosted email which provides email delivery and webmail access to millions of mailboxes, Internet security services, Internet hosting, WHOIS privacy, publishing tools and other value-added services. All of these services are made available to end-users through a network of 37,000 web hosts, ISPs and other resellers around the world. In addition, we also derive revenue by monetizing domain names which are near the end of their lifecycle through advertising revenue or auction sale.
 
Our retail domain name registration services, primarily the Hover and eNom portfolio of websites, including eNom, eNom Central and Bulkregister, derive revenues from the sale of domain name registration and email services to individuals and small businesses. Our retail domain services also includes our Personal Names Service – based on over 36,000 surname domains – that allows roughly two-thirds of Americans to purchase an email address based on their last name.
 
Our portfolio services generate revenue by offering names in our domain portfolio for resale through a number of distribution channels including our reseller network. We also generate advertising revenue from our portfolio.

Net Revenues
 
Network Access Services
 
The Company generates Network Access Services revenues primarily through the provisioning of mobile services. Other sources of revenue include the provisioning of fixed high-speed Internet access as well as billing solutions to ISPs.
Mobile
 
Ting Mobile wireless usage contracts grant customers access to standard talk, text and data mobile services. Ting Mobile contracts are billed based on the actual amount of monthly services utilized by each customer during their billing cycle and charged to customers on a postpaid basis. Voice minutes, text messages and megabytes of data are each billed separately based on a tiered pricing program. The Company recognizes revenue for Ting Mobile usage based on the actual amount of monthly services utilized by each customer.
 
Ting Mobile services are primarily contracted through the Ting website, for one month at a time and contain no commitment to renew the contract following each customer’s monthly billing cycle. The Company’s billing cycle for all Ting Mobile customers is computed based on the customer’s activation date. In order to recognize revenue as the Company satisfies its obligations, we compute the amount of revenues earned but not billed from the end of each billing cycle to the end of each reporting period. In addition, revenues associated with the sale of wireless devices and accessories are recognized when title and risk of loss is transferred to the customer and shipment has occurred. Incentive marketing credits given to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue.
 
Our Roam Mobility Brands also offers standard talk, text and data mobile services. Roam customers prepay for their usage through the Roam Mobility website. When prepayments are received the amount is deferred, and subsequently recognized as the Company satisfies its obligation to provide mobile services. In addition, revenues associated with the sale of SIM cards are recognized when title and risk of loss is transferred to the subscriber and shipment has occurred. Incentive marketing credits given to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue.
 
Other services
 
Other services derive revenues from providing Ting Internet to individuals and small businesses in select cities. In addition, we provide billing, provisioning and customer care software solutions to ISPs through our Platypus billing software. Ting Internet access contracts provide customers Internet access at their home or business through the installation and use of our fiber optic network. Ting Internet contracts are generally prepaid and grant customers with unlimited bandwidth based on a fixed price per month basis. Since consideration is collected before the service period, revenue is initially deferred and recognized as the Company performs its obligation to provide Internet access.

The Company’s billing cycle for all Ting Internet access customers is computed based on the customer’s activation date.

In addition, revenues associated with the sale of Internet hardware to subscribers are recognized when title and risk of loss is transferred to the subscriber and shipment has occurred. Incentive marketing credits given to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue.
 
In those cases, where payment is not received at the time of sale, revenue is not recognized until contract inception unless the collection of the related accounts receivable is reasonably assured. The Company records costs that reflect expected refunds, rebates and credit card charge-backs as a reduction of revenues at the time of the sale based on historical experiences and current expectations.

Domain Services
 
Wholesale 
 
Domain registration contracts, which can be purchased for terms of one to ten years, provide our resellers and retail registrant customers with the exclusive right to a personalized Internet address from which to build an online presence. The Company enters into domain registration contracts in connection with each new, renewed and transferred-in domain registration. At the inception of the contract, the Company charges and collects the registration fee for the entire registration period. Though fees are collected upfront, revenue from domain registrations are recognized rateably over the registration period as domain registration contracts contain a ‘right to access’ license of IP, which is a distinct performance obligation measured over time. The registration period begins once the Company has confirmed that the requested domain name has been appropriately recorded in the registry under contractual performance standards.
 
Historically, our wholesale domain service has constituted the largest portion of our business and encompasses all of our services as an accredited registrar related to the registration, renewal, transfer and management of domain names. In addition, this service fuels other revenue categories as it often is the initial service for which a reseller will engage us, enabling us to follow on with other services and allowing us to add to our portfolio by purchasing names registered through us upon their expiration.
 
The Company is an ICANN accredited registrar. Thus, the Company is the primary obligor with our reseller and retail registrant customers and is responsible for the fulfillment of our registrar services to those parties. As a result, the Company reports revenue in the amount of the fees we receive directly from our reseller and retail registrant customers. Our reseller customers maintain the primary obligor relationship with their retail customers, establish pricing and retain credit risk to those customers. Accordingly, the Company does not recognize any revenue related to transactions between our reseller customers and their ultimate retail customers.
 
Wholesale – Value-Added Services
 
We derive revenue from domain related value-added services like digital certifications, WHOIS privacy, website hosting and hosted email and by providing our resellers and retail registrant customers with tools and additional functionality to be used in conjunction with domain registrations. All domain related value-added services are considered distinct performance obligations which transfer the promised service to the customer over the contracted term. Fees charged to customers for domain related value-added services are collected at the inception of the contract, and revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contracted term, consistent with the satisfaction of the performance obligations.
 
We also derive revenue from other value-added services primarily from Internet hosting services, advertising from the OpenSRS and eNom domain expiry streams.
 
Retail 
 
We derive revenues from Hover and eNom’s retail properties through the sale of retail domain name registration and email services to individuals and small businesses.
 
Portfolio
 
We derive revenue from our portfolio of domain names parking monetization, whereby the Company contracts with third-party Internet advertising publishers to direct web traffic from the Company’s domain expiry stream domains and Internet portfolio domains to advertising websites. Compensation from Internet advertising publishers is calculated variably on a cost-per-action basis based on the number of advertising links that have been visited in a given month.
 
The Company also sells the rights to the Company’s portfolio domains or names acquired through the Company’s domain expiry stream. Revenue generated from sale of domain name contracts, containing a distinct performance obligation to transfer the domain name rights under the Company’s control, is generally recognized once the rights have been transferred and payment has been received in full. Domain portfolio names are sold through our premium domain name service, auctions or in negotiated sales. The size of our domain name portfolio varies over time, as we acquire and sell domains on a regular basis to maximize the overall value and revenue generation potential of our portfolio. In evaluating names for sale, we consider the potential foregone revenue from pay-per-click advertising, as well as other factors. The name will be offered for sale if, based on our evaluation, the name is deemed non-essential to our business and management believes that deriving proceeds from the sale is strategically more beneficial to the Company.

Intellectual Property
 
We believe that we are well positioned in the wholesale domain registration and email markets due in part to our highly-recognized “Tucows”, “OpenSRS” and “eNom” brands and the respect they confer on us as a defender of end-user rights and reseller-friendly approaches to doing business. We were among the first group of 34 registrars to be accredited by ICANN in 1999, and we remain active in Internet governance issues.
 
Our success and ability to compete depend on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our brand name and technology. We rely on a combination of trademark, trade secret and copyright laws, as well as contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property rights.
 
We have registered the Tucows trademark in the United States, Canada and the European Union and we register additional service marks and trademarks as appropriate and where such protection is available.
 
We seek to limit disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring all employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to commit to confidentiality, non-disclosure and work-for-hire agreements. All of our employees are required to sign confidentiality and non-use agreements, which provide that any rights they may have in copyrightable works or patentable technologies accrue to us. Before entering into discussions with potential vendors and partners about our business and technologies, we require them to enter into a non-disclosure agreement. If these discussions result in a license or other business relationship, we also generally require that the agreement containing the parties’ rights and obligations include provisions for the protection of its intellectual property rights.
 
Customers
 
The majority of the customers to whom we provide reseller services are generally either web hosts or ISPs. A small number of customers are consultants and designers providing our services to their business clients. Both our Retail Domain Services and our Network Access Services customers are a very broad mix of consumers, small businesses and corporations.
 
No customer represented more than 10% of our consolidated revenues in any of the last three fiscal years.
 
While web hosts and ISPs are capitalizing on the growth in Internet usage and the demand for new services, they also face significant competition from numerous other service providers with competitive or comparable offerings. This has led such web hosts and ISPs to focus on core competencies. As such resellers are increasingly seeking to outsource non-core services. Outsourcing enables these resellers to better focus on customer acquisition and retention efforts by eliminating the need to own, develop and support non-core applications in-house.
 
Seasonality
 
During the summer months and certain other times of the year, such as major holidays, Internet usage often declines. As a result, many of our services (OpenSRS, eNom Hover, Ting and Roam Mobility) may experience reduced demand during these times. For example, our experience shows that new domain registrations decline during the summer months and around the year-end holidays. Seasonality may also affect advertising, which may have a slight impact on advertisement-based revenue. These seasonal effects could cause fluctuations in our financial results. For Ting Mobile, we see increased gross activation and churn activity in late summer as part of back-to-school activities as well as the holiday season in December. For Roam Mobility, we see increased roaming sales as consumers travel to warmer regions of the United Sates for extended periods of time.
Competition
 
Our competitors may be divided into the following groups:
 

• | US Mobile Phone Service providers such as AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint, who primarily compete with Ting Mobile Services. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | US Broadband providers such as Comcast, Verizon and CenturyLink, who primarily compete with Ting Internet Services. 
• | Retail-oriented domain registrars, such as GoDaddy and Web.com who compete with our Reseller customers in wholesale domain services and with Hover.
• | Wholesale-oriented domain registrars, such as GoDaddy, who market services to resellers such as our customers. 
• | Wholesale Email Service providers, such as Google, Microsoft, Bluetie and MailTrust.

We expect to continue to experience significant competition from the competitors identified above and, as our business continues to develop, we expect to encounter competition from other providers. Service providers, Internet portals, web hosting companies, email hosting companies, outsourced application companies, country code registries and major telecommunication firms may broaden their services to include services we offer.
 
We believe the primary competitive factors in our Network Access Services are:
 

• | Providing a superior customer service experience 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Providing a simple and friendly user experience through more usable web and application interfaces and more fair and transparent pricing;
• | Being agnostic on telephony and internet hardware, including phones and network routers; and 
• | Providing superior technology, speed and reliability with fiber to the home services. 

 
We believe the primary competitive factors in our Domain Services are:
 

• | Providing superior customer service by anticipating the technical requirements and business objectives of resellers and providing them with technical advice to help them understand how our services can be customized to meet their particular needs; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Providing cost savings over in-house solutions by relieving resellers of the expense of acquiring and maintaining hardware and software and the associated administrative burden; 
• | Enabling resellers to better manage their relationships with their end-users; 
• | Facilitating scalability through an infrastructure designed to support millions of transactions across millions of end-users; and 
• | Providing superior technology and infrastructure, consisting of industry-leading software and hardware that allow resellers to provide these services to their customers without having to make substantial investments in their own software or hardware.

 
Although we encounter pricing pressure in many markets in which we compete, we believe the effects of that pressure are mitigated by the fact that we deliver a high degree of value to our customers through our business and technical practices. We believe our status as a trusted supplier also allows us to mitigate the effects of this type of competition. We believe that the long-term relationships we have made with many customers results in a sense of certainty that would not be available to those customers through a competitor.
