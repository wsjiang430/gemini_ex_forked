Business Overview
General Overview
Euronet is a leading electronic payments provider. We offer payment and transaction processing and distribution solutions to financial institutions, retailers, service providers and individual consumers. Our primary product offerings include comprehensive automated teller machine (“ATM”), point-of-sale (“POS”), card outsourcing, card issuing and merchant acquiring services; software solutions and cloud based payment solutions; electronic distribution of prepaid mobile airtime and other electronic payment products; foreign exchange services and global money transfer services.
Core Business Segments
We operate in the following three segments as of December 31, 2018: 
The EFT Processing Segment processes transactions for a network of 40,354 ATMs and approximately 293,000 POS terminals across Europe, the Middle East and Asia Pacific. We provide comprehensive electronic payment solutions consisting of ATM cash withdrawal and deposit services, ATM network participation, outsourced ATM and POS management solutions, credit and debit card outsourcing, and card issuing and merchant acquiring services. In addition to our core business, we offer a variety of value added services, including ATM and POS dynamic currency conversion, domestic and international surcharge, advertising, customer relationship management (“CRM”), mobile top-up, bill payment, fraud management, foreign remittance payout, cardless payout, banknote recycling solutions and tax-refund services. Through this segment, we also offer a suite of integrated electronic financial transaction (“EFT”) software solutions for electronic payment and transaction delivery systems. In 2018, the EFT Processing Segment accounted for approximately 30% of Euronet's consolidated revenues.
The epay Segment provides distribution and processing of prepaid mobile airtime and other electronic content and payment processing services for various prepaid products, cards and services throughout its worldwide distribution network. We operate a network that includes approximately 719,000 POS terminals that enable electronic processing of prepaid mobile airtime “top-up” services and other non-mobile content in Europe, the Middle East, Asia Pacific, the United States and South America. We also provide vouchers and physical gift fulfillment services in Europe, gift card distribution and processing services in most of our markets and digital code distribution in a growing number of markets. In 2018, the epay Segment accounted for approximately 29% of Euronet's consolidated revenues.
The Money Transfer Segment provides global consumer-to-consumer money transfer services, primarily under the brand names Ria, AFEX Money Express, and IME, and global account-to-account money transfer services under the brand names HiFX and xe. We offer services under the brand names Ria, AFEX Money Express and IME through a network of sending agents, Company-owned stores (primarily in North America, Europe and Malaysia) and our websites (riamoneytransfer.com and online.imeremit.com), disbursing money transfers through a worldwide correspondent network that includes approximately 369,000 locations. xe is a provider of foreign currency exchange information on its currency data websites (www.xe.com and www.x-rates.com). We offer global account-to-account money transfer services under the brand names HiFX and xe through our websites (www.xe.com and https://transferxe.com) and xe and HiFX customer service representatives. Late in 2018, we started the process of rebranding our HiFX global account-to-account money transfer services, integrating them under the single brand name of xe. We anticipate that this process will be completed globally during the first half of 2019. In addition to money transfers, we offer customers bill payment services (primarily in the U.S.), payment alternatives such as money orders, comprehensive check cashing services for a wide variety of issued checks, along with competitive foreign currency exchange services and mobile top-up. Through our HiFM brand, we offer cash management solutions and foreign currency risk management services to small-to-medium sized businesses. We are one of the largest global money transfer companies in terms of revenues and transaction volumes. In 2018, the Money Transfer Segment accounted for approximately 41% of Euronet's consolidated revenues.

Euronet conducts business globally, serving customers in approximately 165 countries. We have 13 transaction processing centers, including six in Europe, five in Asia Pacific and two in North America. We also maintain 65 business offices that are located in 41 countries. Our corporate offices are located in Leawood, Kansas, USA.
Historical Perspective
Euronet was established in 1994 as Euronet Bank Access Kft., a Hungarian limited liability company. Operations began in 1995 when we established a processing center in Budapest, Hungary and installed our first ATMs in Hungary, followed by Poland and Germany in 1996. Euronet was reorganized in March 1997, in connection with its initial public offering, and at that time, our operating entities became wholly owned subsidiaries of Euronet Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation. We changed our name from Euronet Services, Inc. to Euronet Worldwide, Inc. in August 2001.
Initially, most of Euronet's resources were devoted to establishing and expanding the ATM network and ATM management services business in Europe. In December 1998, we acquired Arkansas Systems, Inc. (now known as "Euronet USA"), a U.S.-based company that produces electronic payment and transaction delivery systems software for retail banks internationally, which resulted in significant ongoing savings in third-party licensing, services and maintenance costs. By the end of 1998, we were doing business in Hungary, Poland, Germany, the Czech Republic and Croatia. From 1998 until 2005, we developed networks in India, Slovakia, Serbia and Bulgaria.
In 2005, we expanded the product offerings of the EFT Processing Segment through the acquisition of Instreamline S.A., a Greek company that provides credit card and POS outsourcing services in addition to debit card and transaction gateway switching services in Greece and the Balkan region. In 2007, we combined our EFT and Software segments as both businesses are strategically aligned due to the fact that our software segment primarily supports our EFT service offerings and processing centers. In 2009 Euronet, through one of its group companies, was granted authorization as an e-money institution in the United Kingdom ("U.K.") under the E-Money Directive of the European Union ("E.U."). In 2011, the Second E-Money Directive ("2EMD") came into effect. 2EMD enables authorized e-money institutions to provide payment services and issue e-money throughout the European Economic Area ("EEA") under a single regulatory framework. As a result of 2EMD, Euronet, through one of its group companies, obtained relevant memberships of Visa and MasterCard during 2011. By obtaining the status as an authorized e-money institution together with its principal memberships of Visa and MasterCard, Euronet has been able to expand its Independent ATM Deployed ("IAD") networks across Europe. In 2018, Euronet, through one of its group companies, was reauthorized by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority to provide payment services under the Second Payment Services Directive (“PSD2”) as well as continue to provide e-money serves under the 2EMD. By the end of 2018, Euronet's IAD network of ATMs had expanded to include 24 countries. Our product portfolio for the EFT Processing Segment operates in 86 countries.
In 2003, Euronet added a complementary business line through the acquisition of epay Limited (“epay”), which had offices in the U.K. and Australia. Through subsequent acquisitions between 2003 and 2011, the epay Segment continued to expand in Europe (Germany, Romania, Spain and the U.K.), the U.S., the Middle East, Asia and Brazil, and established new offices in New Zealand, Poland, India and Italy. We believe the epay Segment is the world's leading international network for distribution and processing of prepaid mobile airtime ("top-up") as well as other electronic payment products and services.
In 2007, we established the Money Transfer Segment after completing the acquisition of Los Angeles-based Ria, one of the largest global money transfer companies in terms of revenues and transaction volumes. Established in 1987, Ria originates and terminates transactions through a network of sending agents and Company-owned stores located around the world. In November 2009, Ria obtained a payment services license under the E.U.'s Payment Services Directive ("PSD") from the U.K. Financial Services Authority, (now the Financial Conduct Authority), which allowed Ria to operate under one license and one regulator for all EEA Member States ("Member States"). Ria also obtained payment services licenses in Spain and France. The licenses also facilitated expansion into new markets through the sales of money transfers through agents in countries where the use of agents was not previously permitted. Ria became reauthorized under PSD2 in 2018. In 2014, Euronet added a complementary product to the money transfer portfolio through the acquisition of HiFX, which offers account-to-account international payment services to high-income individuals and small-to-medium sized businesses. In 2015, we completed the acquisition of IME (M) Sdn Bhd ("IME") which provided Euronet with immediate entry into the Asian and Middle East money transfer send markets. In 2015, we also added a complementary business line through the acquisition of xe Corporation ("xe"), which provides currency-related data and international payment services. In addition to expanding its money transfer network, the segment expanded its product portfolio to offer complementary non-money transfer products such as bill payment and check cashing, and prepaid services in conjunction with the epay Segment. 
In October 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of YourCash Europe Limited and its subsidiaries (“YourCash”). YourCash is a company incorporated in England that owns and operates primarily merchant filled ATMs in the United 
4

Kingdom, Netherlands, and Ireland. In March 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of Innova Tax Free Group S.L. and its subsidiaries (“Innova”). Innova is a company incorporated in Spain and offers tax refunds services to consumers in Spain, Portugal, United Kingdom, France, Italy and Germany. In May 2018, the Company acquired Easycash Ireland Limited (“Easycash”). Easycash owns and operates a network of ATMs in the Republic of Ireland.

EFT Processing Segment 
Overview
Our EFT Processing Segment provides comprehensive electronic payment solutions consisting of ATM cash withdrawal and deposit services, ATM network participation, outsourced ATM and POS management solutions, credit and debit card outsourcing; card issuing and merchant acquiring services. In addition to our core business, we offer a variety of value added services, including ATM and POS dynamic currency conversion, domestic and international surcharge, advertising, CRM, prepaid mobile top-up, bill payment, money transfer, fraud management, foreign remittance payout, cardless payout, banknote recycling solutions and tax-refund services. We provide these services either through our Euronet-owned ATMs and POS terminals, through contracts under which we operate ATMs and POS terminals on behalf of our customers or, for certain services, as stand alone products. Through this segment, we also offer a suite of integrated EFT software solutions for electronic payment and transaction delivery systems. 
The major sources of revenues generated by our ATM network are recurring monthly management fees, transaction-based fees, surcharges and margins earned on dynamic currency conversion transactions. We receive fixed monthly fees under many of our outsourced management contracts. The EFT Processing Segment also generates revenues from POS operations and merchant management, card network management for credit, debit, prepaid and loyalty cards, prepaid mobile airtime recharge and other electronic content on ATMs and ATM advertising. We primarily service financial institutions in the developing markets of Central, Eastern and Southern Europe (Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Romania, Serbia, Greece and Ukraine), the Middle East and Asia Pacific (India, China, Malaysia and Pakistan), as well as several developed countries of Western Europe. As of December 31, 2018, we operated 40,354 ATMs compared to 37,133 at December 31, 2017. The increase was largely due to the expansion of our ATM networks in India and several European countries, and the acquisition of Easycash.
We monitor the number of transactions made by cardholders on our network. These include cash withdrawals, balance inquiries, deposits, prepaid mobile airtime recharge purchases, dynamic currency conversion transactions and certain denied (unauthorized) transactions. We do not bill certain transactions on our network to financial institutions, and we have excluded these transactions for reporting purposes. The number of transactions processed over our networks has increased over the last five years at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of approximately 21.2% as indicated in the following table:

(in millions) | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 
EFT Processing transactions per year | 1,262 | 1,523 | 1,885 | 2,352 | 2,721

Our processing centers for the EFT Processing Segment are located in Budapest, Hungary; Mumbai, India; Beijing, China; and Karachi, Pakistan. Our processing centers run two types of proprietary transaction switching software: our legacy ITM software, which we have used and sold to banks since 1998 through our Software Solutions unit, and a new, innovative switching software package named “REN” which is hosted in Martinsried, Germany. The software operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We have been progressively transitioning all of our networks to REN.
EFT Processing Products and Services
Outsourced Management Solutions
Euronet offers outsourced management services to financial institutions, merchants, mobile phone operators and other organizations using our processing centers' electronic financial transaction processing software. Our outsourced management services include management of existing ATM networks, development of new ATM networks, management of POS networks, management of automated deposit terminals, management of credit and debit card databases and other financial processing services. These services include 24-hour monitoring of each ATM's status and cash condition, managing the cash levels in each 
5

ATM, coordinating the cash delivery and providing automatic dispatches for necessary service calls. We also provide real-time transaction authorization, advanced monitoring, network gateway access, network switching, 24-hour customer service, maintenance, cash settlement and reconciliation, forecasting and reporting. Since our infrastructure can support a significant increase in transactions, any new outsourced management services agreements should provide additional revenue with lower incremental cost.
Our outsourced management services agreements generally provide for fixed monthly management fees and, in most cases, fees payable for each transaction. The transaction fees under these agreements are generally lower than those under card acceptance agreements.
Euronet-Branded ATM Transaction Processing
Our Euronet-branded ATM networks, also known as IAD networks, are primarily managed by a processing center that uses our internally developed software solutions. The ATMs in our IAD networks are able to process transactions for holders of credit and debit cards issued by or bearing the logos of financial institutions and international card organizations such as American Express®, Visa®, MasterCard®, Diners Club International®, Discover® and UnionPay International©, as well as international ATM networks such as PULSE®. This is accomplished through our agreements and relationships with these institutions, international credit and debit card issuers and international card associations.
When a bank cardholder conducts a transaction on a Euronet-owned ATM or automated deposit terminal ("ADT"), we receive a fee from the cardholder's bank for that transaction. The bank pays us this fee either directly or indirectly through a central switching and settlement network. When paid indirectly, this fee is referred to as the “interchange fee.” All of the banks in a shared ATM and POS switching system establish the amount of the interchange fee by agreement. We receive transaction-processing fees for successful transactions and, in certain circumstances, for transactions that are not completed because they fail to receive authorization. The fees paid to us by the card issuers are independent of any fees charged by the card issuers to cardholders in connection with the ATM transactions. In some cases, we may also charge a direct access fee or surcharge to cardholders at the ATM. The direct access fee is added to the amount of the cash withdrawal and debited to the cardholder's account.
We generally receive fees or earn margin from our customers for six types of ATM transactions:

• | Cash withdrawals;


• | Cash deposits;


• | Balance inquiries;


• | Transactions not completed because the relevant card issuer does not give authorization;


• | Dynamic currency conversion; and


• | Prepaid telecommunication recharges and other electronic content.

Card Acceptance or Sponsorship Agreements
Our agreements with financial institutions and international card organizations generally provide that all credit and debit cards issued by the customer financial institution or organization may be used at all ATMs that we operate in a given market. In most markets, we act under sponsorship by our own e-money licensed entity, Euronet 360 Finance Limited ("E360"). In a few markets, we have agreements with a financial institution under which we are designated as a service provider (which we refer to as “sponsorship agreements”) for the acceptance of cards bearing international logos, such as Visa and MasterCard. These card acceptance or sponsorship agreements allow us to receive transaction authorization directly from the card issuing institution or international card organizations on a stand-in basis. Our agreements generally provide for a term of three to seven years and renew automatically unless either party provides notice of non-renewal prior to the termination date. In some cases, the agreements are terminable by either party upon six months' notice. We are generally able to connect a financial institution to our network within 30 to 90 days of signing a card acceptance agreement. The financial institution provides the cash needed to complete transactions on the ATM, but we do provide a significant portion of the cash to our IAD network to fund ATM transactions ourselves. Euronet is generally liable for the cash in the ATM networks.
6

Under our card acceptance agreements, the ATM transaction fees we charge vary depending on the type of transaction and the number of transactions attributable to a particular card issuer. Our agreements generally provide for payment in local currency. Transaction fees are sometimes denominated in euros or U.S. dollars. Transaction fees are billed to financial institutions and card organizations with payment terms typically no longer than one month.
Dynamic Currency Conversion 
We offer dynamic currency conversion (“DCC”) over our IAD networks, ATM networks that we operate on an outsourced basis for banks, and over banks' ATM networks or POS devices as a stand-alone service. DCC is a feature of the underlying ATM or POS transaction that is offered to customers completing transactions using a foreign debit or credit card issued in a country with a currency other than the currency where the ATM or POS is located. The customer is offered a choice between completing the transaction in the local currency or in the customer's home currency via a DCC transaction. If a cardholder chooses to perform a DCC transaction, the acquirer or processor performs the foreign exchange conversion at the time that the funds are delivered at an ATM or transactions completed through the POS terminal, which results in a pre-defined amount of the customer's home currency being charged to their card. Alternatively, the customer may have the transaction converted by the card issuing bank, in which the amount of local currency is communicated to the card issuing bank and the card issuing bank makes the conversion to the customer's home currency.
When a customer chooses DCC at an ATM or POS device and Euronet acts as the acquirer or processor, we receive all or a portion of the foreign exchange margin on the conversion of the transaction. On our IAD ATMs, Euronet receives the entire foreign exchange margin. If Euronet is not the acquirer or processor of the transaction, we share the DCC revenue with the sponsor bank. On ATMs or POS devices that are operated for banks, or where we offer DCC as a stand-alone service to banks or merchants, we share the foreign exchange margin. The foreign exchange margin on a DCC transaction increases the amount Euronet earns from the underlying ATM or POS transaction and supports deployment of additional ATMs in new locations.
Other Products and Services
Our network of owned or operated ATMs allows for the sale of financial and other products or services at a low incremental cost. We have developed value added services in addition to basic cash withdrawal and balance inquiry transactions. These value added services include mobile top-up, fraud management, bill payment, domestic and international surcharge, CRM, foreign remittance payout, cardless payout, banknote recycling, electronic content, ticket and voucher, and advertising. We are committed to the ongoing development of innovative new products and services to offer our EFT processing customers.
Euronet offers multinational merchants a Single European Payments Area (“SEPA”)-compliant cross-border transaction processing solution. SEPA is an area in which all electronic payments can be made and received in euros, whether between or within national boundaries, under the same basic conditions, rights and obligations, regardless of their location. This single, centralized acquiring platform enables merchants to benefit from cost savings and faster, more efficient payments transfer. Although many European countries are not members of the eurozone, the platform can serve the merchants in these countries as well, through its multi-currency functionality.
Software Solutions
We also offer a suite of integrated software solutions for electronic payments and transaction delivery systems. We generate revenues for our software products from licensing, professional services and maintenance fees for software and sales of related hardware, primarily to financial institutions around the world. 
Additionally, our software products are an integral part of the EFT Processing Segment product lines, and our investment in research, development, delivery and customer support reflects our ongoing commitment to an expanded customer base both internally and externally. Our proprietary software is used by processing centers in our EFT Processing Segment, resulting in cost savings and added value compared to third-party license and maintenance options. Our proprietary software consists of our legacy ITM software, which we have used and sold to banks since 1998 through our Software Solutions unit, and an innovative switching software package named REN that we released in 2017.
We currently operate REN in our processing center to process payments for our own networks in Europe and we are progressively transitioning all our networks globally to REN. The private cloud architecture of REN allows us to simultaneously deploy REN across multiple physical locations. While we currently only operate REN for our internal resources, REN is scalable and will allow us to offer payment and digital solutions to third parties. In addition to payments processing, REN also supports other digital elements, including card issuing for physical and virtual cards, loyalty services, 
7

Know Your Customer compliance, real time settlement, inventory management, risk and fraud management and other services. REN will be used as a platform to connect Euronet assets to offer digital payment solutions.
EFT Processing Segment Strategy
The EFT Processing Segment maintains a strategy to expand the network of ATMs and POS terminals into developed and developing markets that have the greatest potential for growth. In addition, we follow a supporting strategy to increase the penetration of value added (or complementary) services across our existing customer base, including DCC, surcharge, cardless payment, banknote recycling solutions, tax refund services, advertising, fraud management, bill payment, mobile top-up, CRM and foreign remittance payout.
We continually strive to make our own ATM networks more efficient by eliminating underperforming ATMs and installing ATMs in more desirable locations. We make selective additions to our own ATM network if we see market demand and profit opportunities. In tourist locations, we also shut down ATMs during the winter season when tourist activity is low. 
In recent years, the need for “all-in” services has increased. Banks, particularly smaller banks, are increasingly looking for integrated ATM, POS and card issuing processing and management services. Euronet is well positioned for this opportunity as it can offer a full end-to-end solution to the potential partners.
Additional growth opportunities are driven through financial institutions that are receptive to outsourcing the operation of their ATM, POS and card networks. The operation of these devices requires expensive hardware and software and specialized personnel. These resources are available to us, and we offer them to our customers under outsourcing contracts. The expansion and enhancement of our outsourced management solutions in new and existing markets will remain an important business opportunity for Euronet. Increasing the number of non-owned ATMs and POS terminals that we operate under management services agreements and continued development of our credit and debit card outsourcing business would provide continued growth while minimizing our capital investment.
Complementary services offered by our epay Segment, where we provide prepaid top-up services through POS terminals, strengthens the EFT Processing Segment's line of services. We plan to continue to expand our technology and business methods into other markets where we operate and further leverage our relationships with mobile phone operators and financial institutions to facilitate that expansion.
Seasonality
Our EFT Processing business experiences its heaviest demand for cash withdrawals and DCC during the third quarter of the fiscal year, coinciding with the tourism season. It is also impacted by seasonality during the fourth quarter and first quarter of each year due to higher transaction levels during the holiday season and lower levels after the holiday season. This seasonality is increased due to our practice of "winterizing" ATMs in tourist locations that experience significantly higher traffic during the summer. Winterizing involves shutting down the ATMs during the slower winter months and results in lower overall transaction volumes in the EFT Processing Segment during those months. As we have expanded our IAD network in tourist locations, the financial impact of winterization has increased, because we continue to bear the expense of winterized ATMs even though they do not generate transactions during the winter months.
Significant Customers and Government Contracts
No individual customer of the EFT Processing Segment makes up greater than 10% of total consolidated revenues. In India, we have contracts with government-owned banks to provide certain ATM driving and transaction switching services and mobile airtime recharge services. Additionally, certain government-owned banks are members of our shared ATM network in India. In Croatia, we lease land and other property for certain ATM sites from companies that are majority-owned by the government. In Pakistan, we have a contract with a government-owned bank to provide software support services. 
Competition
Our principal EFT Processing competitors include ATM networks owned by financial institutions and national switches consisting of consortiums of local banks that provide outsourcing and transaction services to financial institutions and independent ATM deployers in a particular country. Additionally, large, well-financed companies that operate ATMs offer ATM network and outsourcing services, and those that provide card outsourcing, POS processing and merchant acquiring services also compete with us in various markets. Small local operators have also recently begun offering their services, particularly in the IAD market. None of these competitors has a dominant market share in any of our markets. Competitive factors in our EFT 
8

Processing Segment include breadth of service offering, network availability and response time, price to both the financial institution and to its customers, ATM location and access to other networks.
epay Segment 
Overview
We currently offer prepaid mobile airtime top-up services and other electronic content and payment processing services for various prepaid products, cards and services on a network of approximately 719,000 POS terminals across approximately 334,000 retailer locations in Europe, the Middle East, Asia Pacific, the United States and South America. Our processing centers for the epay Segment are located in Billericay, U.K.; Martinsried, Germany; Hamburg, Germany; Milan, Italy; Buena Park, California, USA; and Kansas City, Missouri, USA.
Since 2003, we have expanded our prepaid business in new and existing markets by drawing upon our depth of experience to build and expand relationships with content providers, mobile phone operators and retailers. We offer a wide range of products across our retail networks, including prepaid mobile airtime, prepaid debit cards, prepaid gift cards, prepaid electronic content such as music, games and software, prepaid vouchers, transport payments, lottery payments, prepaid long distance and bill payment processing assistance through partnerships with various licensed money transmitters.
Sources of Revenues
The epay Segment generates commissions or processing fees from the distribution of electronic content and from telecommunications service providers for the sale and distribution of prepaid mobile airtime. In 2018, of the total revenues and gross profit for the epay Segment, approximately 62% of total revenues and approximately 69% of gross profit was from electronic content other than prepaid mobile airtime (non-mobile products).
Customers generally purchase non-mobile prepaid content as a gift or for self-use. Content is generally purchased in two ways:

• | Directly online from the content provider using an online payment method; or


• | Through physical retail stores, online retailers or other electronic channels, including payment wallets, online banking, mobile applications and other sources.

Customers using mobile phones generally pay for their usage in one of two ways: 

• | Through “postpaid” accounts, where usage is billed at the end of each billing period; or


• | Through “prepaid” accounts, where customers pay in advance by crediting their accounts prior to usage.

Although mobile phone operators in the U.S. and certain European countries have provided service principally through postpaid accounts, the norm in many other countries in Europe and the rest of the world is to offer wireless service on a prepaid basis. 
Prepaid mobile phone credits are generally distributed using personal identification numbers or "PINs." We distribute PINs in two ways. First, we establish an electronic connection to the mobile operator and the retailer. When the sale to a customer is initiated, the terminal requests the PIN from the mobile operator via our transaction processing platform. These transactions obtain the PIN directly from the mobile operator and, therefore, Euronet does not carry PIN inventory. The customer pays the retailer and the retailer becomes obligated to make settlement to us of the principal amount of the mobile airtime sold. We maintain systems that know the amount of mobile top-up sold by the retailer which allows us in turn to bill that retailer for the mobile top-up sold. 
Second, we purchase PINs from the mobile operator which are electronically sent to our processing platform. We establish an electronic connection with the POS terminals in retailer locations and our processing platform provides the terminal with a PIN when the mobile top-up is purchased. We maintain systems that monitor transaction levels at each terminal. As sales of prepaid mobile airtime to customers are completed, the inventory on the platform is reduced by the PIN purchased. The customer payment and settlement with the retailer are the same as described above. 
We expand our distribution networks through the signing of new contracts with retailers, and in some markets, through the acquisition of existing networks. We are continuing to focus on growing our distribution network through independent sales organizations that contract directly with retailers in their network to distribute prepaid mobile airtime or other non-mobile content from the retailers' POS terminals. We continue to increase our focus on direct relationships with chains of 
9

supermarkets, convenience stores, petrol stations, and other larger scale retailers, where we can negotiate agreements with the retailers on multi-year bases.
In addition to sale of traditional mobile top-up volume described above, we have expanded distribution into non-mobile products and other value-added services. We have leveraged our existing technology infrastructure to sell non-mobile products, which have been sold through our traditional retailer network and new retailer networks such as electronic channels. In the U.S., most prepaid non-mobile content is purchased for gifting; in markets outside the U.S., consumers generally purchase prepaid non-mobile content for self-use.
epay Products and Services
Prepaid Mobile Airtime Transaction Processing
We process prepaid mobile airtime top-up transactions on our POS network across Europe, the Middle East, Asia Pacific, North America and South America for two types of clients: distributors and retailers. Both types of client transactions start with a consumer in a retail store. The retailer uses a specially programmed POS terminal in the store, the retailer's electronic cash register (ECR) system, or web-based POS device that is connected to our network to buy prepaid mobile airtime. The consumer will select a predefined amount of mobile airtime from the carrier of choice, and the retailer enters the selection into the POS terminal. The consumer will pay that amount to the retailer (in cash or other payment methods accepted by the retailer). The POS device then transmits the selected transaction to our processing center. Using the electronic connection we maintain with the mobile phone operator or drawing from our inventory of PINs, the purchased amount of mobile airtime will be either credited to the consumer's account or delivered via a PIN printed by the terminal and given to the consumer. In the case of PINs printed by the terminal, the consumer must then call the mobile phone operator's toll-free number to activate the purchased airtime to the consumer's mobile account.
One difference in our relationships with various retailers and distributors is the way in which we charge for our services. For distributors and certain very large retailers, we charge a processing fee. However, the majority of our transactions occur with smaller retailers. With these clients, we receive a commission or discount on each transaction that is withheld from the payments made to the mobile phone operator, and we share that commission/discount with the retailers.
Closed Loop Gift Cards
Closed loop (private-branded) gift cards are generally described as merchant-specific prepaid cards, used for purchases exclusively at a particular merchant's locations. We distribute closed loop gift cards in various categories, including dining, retail, and digital media, such as music, games and software. Generally, the gift card is activated when a consumer loads funds (with cash, debit or credit card payment) or purchases a preloaded value gift card at a retail store location or online.
Open Loop Gift Cards
Open loop (network-branded) gift cards are prepaid gift cards associated with an electronic payment network (such as Visa or MasterCard) and are honored at multiple, unaffiliated locations (wherever cards from these networks are generally accepted). They are not merchant-specific. We distribute and issue single-use, non-reloadable open loop gift cards carrying the Visa brand in our retail channels. After the consumer purchases the preloaded value gift card at a retail store location or online, the consumer must call the toll-free number on the back of the card to activate it.
Open Loop Reloadable
We distribute Visa and MasterCard issued debit cards provided by Green Dot, NetSpend and other card issuers. We also manage and distribute a proprietary debit card that allows a retailer to issue its own reloadable store-branded card. Open loop reloadable cards have features similar to a bank checking account, including direct deposit, purchasing capability wherever a credit card is accepted, bill payment and ATM access. Fees are charged to consumers for the initial load and reload transactions, monthly account maintenance and other transactions. 
Other Products and Services
Our POS network is used for the distribution of other products and services, including games and software, bill payment, lottery tickets and transportation products. Through our cadooz subsidiary, we also distribute vouchers and physical gifts into the business-to-business ("B2B") channel principally for the purposes of employee and customer incentives and rewards. In 
10

certain locations, the terminals used for prepaid services can also be used for electronic funds transfer to process credit and debit card payments for retail merchandise. We provide promotion and advertising for content providers of their prepaid content throughout our retail distribution network. We also provide card production and processing services to some of our prepaid gift card partners and telecom content providers.
Retailer and Distributor Contracts
We provide our prepaid services through POS terminals or web-based POS devices installed in retail outlets or, in the case of major retailers, through direct connections between their ECR systems and our processing centers. In markets where we operate proprietary technology (the U.K., Germany, Australia, Poland, Ireland, New Zealand, Spain, Greece, India, Italy, Brazil and the U.S.), we generally own and maintain the POS terminals. In certain countries in Europe, the terminals are sold to the retailers or to distributors who service the retailer. Our agreements with major retailers for the POS services typically have one to three-year terms. These agreements include terms regarding the connection of our networks to the respective retailer's registers or payment terminals or the maintenance of POS terminals, and obligations concerning settlement and liability for transactions processed. Generally, our agreements with individual or small retailers have shorter terms and provide that either party can terminate the agreement upon three to six months' notice.
In Germany, distributors are key intermediaries in the sale of mobile top-up. As a result, our business in Germany is substantially concentrated in, and dependent upon, relationships with our major distributors. The termination of any of our agreements with major distributors could materially and adversely affect our prepaid business in Germany. However, we have been establishing agreements with independent German retailers in order to diversify our exposure to such distributors.
The number of transactions processed on our POS network over the last five years are indicated in the table below:

(in millions) | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 
epay processing transactions per year | 1,244 | 1,335 | 1,294 | 1,186 | 1,149

The loss of a high-volume, low-margin customer in the Middle East in 2017 contributed to an overall decline in processing transactions. 
epay Segment Strategy
Mobile top-up transactions are declining in many developed markets and transaction fees for mobile transactions are being compressed by the mobile operators. epay's strategy is to defend margins in developing markets by providing value added services to mobile operators and to decrease our reliance on mobile top-up by increasing distribution of other electronic content. New product initiatives focus on products such as gift card malls, prepaid debit cards, transport and electronic content, including music, software and games. Strategic execution behind new products includes the development of relationships with global consumer product brands. This strategy leverages the global scale of the epay business allowing global brands to be sold in many or all of the countries in which we have a presence. Examples of global brands we distribute include iTunes, Google Play, Sony, and Microsoft.
Telecommunications companies and other content providers have a substantial opportunity to increase revenues by diversifying the products and services currently offered to their retailers. epay is deploying additional content through its POS network to retailers and distributors all over the world. The reach, capabilities and quality of the epay network are appealing as a global distribution channel. We are one of the largest worldwide multi-country operators, and believe we have a distinct competitive advantage from the existing relationships that we maintain with prepaid content providers and retailers.
Seasonality
As the product mix continues to change, the epay business is impacted by seasonality during the fourth quarter and first quarter of each year due to the higher transaction levels during the holiday season and lower levels following the holiday season. 
11

Significant Customers and Government Contracts
No individual customer of our epay Segment makes up greater than 10% of total consolidated revenues. epay has a contract for the technology and distribution infrastructure for six state-owned lotteries in Germany. In addition, epay has contracts with the state of Florida's (USA) Turnpike partners and Transurban Limited, the largest manager of toll road networks in Australia, Cubic supporting New South Wales Transport ticketing in Australia and with New Zealand Transport Authority, which operates all toll roads in New Zealand. In Germany, cadooz has a contract with Deutsche Bahn, which is majority owned by the German state. We also have a contract for the distribution of mobile airtime with a Saudi company, which is majority owned by the Saudi government. There are no other government contracts in the epay Segment.
Competition
We face competition in the prepaid business in all of our markets. We compete with a few multinational companies that operate in several of our markets. In other markets, our competition is from smaller, local companies. The mobile operators in all of our markets have retail distribution networks, and in some markets, on-line distribution of their own through which they offer top-up services for their own products.
We believe our size and market share are competitive advantages in many markets. In addition, we believe our processing platforms are a competitive advantage. We have extremely flexible technical platforms that enable us to tailor POS solutions to individual retailers and mobile operator and non-mobile content provider requirements where appropriate. Our platforms are also able to provide value added services other than processing which makes us a more valuable partner to the content providers and retailers. We have introduced new digital products into the marketplace such as digital payment for online media subscriptions. Many of these products are not offered by our competitors and in many countries, these are new products. We are capitalizing on being the first to market for these products.
The principal competitive factors in the epay Segment include price (that is, the level of commission paid to retailers for each transaction), breadth of products and up-time offered on the system. Major retailers with high volumes are in a position to demand a larger share of the commission, which increases the amount of competition among service providers. We are seeing signs that some mobile operators are expanding their distribution networks to provide top-up services on-line or via mobile devices, which provides other alternatives for consumers to use.
Money Transfer Segment
Overview
We provide global money transfer services primarily under the brand names Ria, IME, xe and HiFX. Ria and IME provide consumer-to-consumer money transfer services through a global network of more than 369,000 locations and our website riamoneytransfer.com and online.imeremit.com. Most of our money transfers are originated through sending agents in approximately 33 countries, with money transfer delivery completed in 149 countries. The initiation of a consumer money transfer occurs through retail agents, Company-owned stores or online, while the delivery of money transfers can occur with bank correspondents, retailer agents or from certain ATMs. Our websites allow consumers to send funds online, using a bank account or credit or debit card, for pay-out directly to a bank account or for cash pickup. 
In addition, we provide global account-to-account money transfer services under the brand names HiFX and xe. We offer money transfer services via our websites (www.xe.com and https://transferxe.com) and through HiFX and xe customer service representatives. Late in 2018, we started the process of rebranding our HiFX global account-to-account money transfer services, integrating them under the single brand name of xe. We anticipate that this process will be completed globally during the first half of 2019. xe also provides foreign currency exchange information on its currency data websites (www.xe.com and www.x-rates.com). Through our HiFM brand, we offer cash management solutions and foreign currency risk management services to small-to-medium sized businesses.
We monitor the number of transactions made through our money transfer networks. The number of transactions processed on our network has increased over the last five years at a CAGR of approximately 22.0% as indicated in the following table:

(in millions) | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 
Money transfer transactions per year | 48.5 | 68.7 | 82.3 | 92.2 | 107.6

12

Our sending agent network includes a variety of agents, including Walmart, large/medium size regional retailers, convenience stores, bodegas, multi-service shops and phone centers, which are predominantly found in areas with a large immigrant population. Each Ria money transfer transaction is processed using Euronet's proprietary software system and checked for security, completeness and compliance with federal and state regulations at every step of the process. Senders can track the progress of their transfers through Ria's customer service representatives, and funds are delivered quickly to their beneficiaries via our extensive payout network, which includes large banks and non-bank financial institutions, post offices and large retailers. Our processing centers for the Money Transfer Segment are located in Buena Park, California, USA; Bracknell, U.K.; Auckland, New Zealand; Kansas City, Missouri, USA; and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. We mainly operate Ria call centers in Buena Park, California; Antiguo Cuscatlán, El Salvador; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Dakar, Senegal; Mumbai, India and Madrid, Spain and provide multi-lingual customer service for both our agents and consumers. Additionally, we operate a call center for xe and HiFX in Sydney, Australia.
We are one of the largest global money transfer companies in terms of revenues and transaction volumes. Our Money Transfer Segment processed approximately $49.7 billion in money transfers in 2018. 
Money Transfer Products and Services
Money transfer products and services are sold primarily through three channels at agent locations, Company-owned stores and on internet enabled devices at riamoneytransfer.com, online.imeremit.com, xe.com, and https://transferxe.com (online transactions).
In an online transaction, customers send funds, using a bank account or credit or debit card, for pay-out at most of our agent locations around the world or directly to a bank account. 
Through our TeleRia service, customers connect to our call center from a telephone available at an agent location and a representative collects the information over the telephone and enters it directly into our secure proprietary system. As soon as the data capture is complete, our central system automatically faxes a confirmation receipt to the agent location for the customer to review and sign and the customer pays the agent the money to be transferred, together with a fee. The agent then faxes the signed receipt back to Ria to complete the transaction.
Through our Walmart-2-Walmart Money Transfer Service, which allows customers to transfer money to and from Walmart stores in the U.S., our Ria business executes the transfers with Walmart serving as both the sending agent and payout correspondent. Ria earns a significantly lower margin from these transactions than its traditional money transfers; however, the arrangement adds a significant number of transactions to Ria’s business. The agreement with Walmart establishes Ria as the only party through which Walmart will sell U.S. domestic money transfers branded with Walmart marks. The agreement had an initial term expiring in April 2017 and was renewed for an additional three-year period until April 2020. Thereafter, it will automatically renew for one year terms unless either party provides notice to the contrary. The agreement imposes certain obligations on each party, the most significant being service level requirements by Ria and money transfer compliance requirements by Walmart. Any violation of these requirements by Ria could result in an obligation to indemnify Walmart or termination of the contract by Walmart. However, the agreement allows the parties to resolve disputes by mutual agreement without termination of the agreement. 
In addition to money transfers, Ria also offers customers bill payment services, payment alternatives such as money orders, comprehensive check cashing services for a wide variety of issued checks, along with competitive foreign currency exchange services and mobile top-up. These services are all offered through our Company-owned stores while select services are offered through our agents in certain markets.
Ria money orders are widely recognized and exchanged throughout the United States. Our check cashing services cover payroll and personal checks, cashier checks, tax refund checks, government checks, insurance drafts and money orders. Our bill payment services offer timely posting of customer bills for over 3000 companies, including electric and gas utilities and telephone/wireless companies. Bill payment services are offered primarily in the U.S.
xe and HiFX offer account-to-account international payment service to high-income individuals and small-to-medium sized businesses, complementing our existing consumer-to-consumer money transfer business. xe has an innovative multi-channel platform which allows customers to make transfers, track payments and manage their international payment activity online or through a customer service representative. HiFM offers cash management solutions and foreign currency risk management services to small-to-medium sized businesses. xe also offers foreign currency exchange subscriptions and advertising on its websites.

Sources of Revenues
Revenues in the Money Transfer Segment are derived through the charging of a transaction fee, as well as a margin earned from purchasing foreign currency at wholesale exchange rates and selling the foreign currency to customers at retail exchange rates. Sending agents and receiving agents for consumer-to-consumer products each earn fees for cash collection and distribution services. Euronet recognizes these fees as direct operating costs at the time of sale.
Money Transfer Segment Strategy
The Money Transfer Segment's strategy is to increase the volume of money transfers processed by leveraging our existing banking and merchant/retailer relationships to expand our agent and correspondent networks in existing corridors. In addition, we pursue expansion into high-potential money transfer corridors from the U.S. and internationally beyond the traditional U.S. to Mexico corridor. Further, we expect to continue to take advantage of cross-selling opportunities with our epay and EFT Processing Segments by providing prepaid services through our stores and agents, and offering our money transfer services at select prepaid retail locations and ATMs we operate in key markets. We will continue to make investments in our systems to support this growth. Additionally, we are expanding our xe business into new markets.
Seasonality
Our money transfer business is significantly impacted by seasonality that varies by region. In most of our markets, we experience increased money transfer transaction levels during the month of May and in the fourth quarter of each year, coinciding with various holidays. Additionally, in the U.S. to Mexico corridor, we usually experience our heaviest volume during the May through October time frame, coinciding with the increase in worker migration patterns and various holidays, and our lowest volumes during the first quarter. 
Significant Customers and Government Contracts
No individual customer of our Money Transfer Segment makes up greater than 10% of total consolidated revenues. The Money Transfer Segment maintains correspondent relationships with a number of financial institutions whose ownership includes governments of the correspondents' countries of origin. Those countries include Armenia, Bangladesh, Benin, Bhutan, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Burundi, China, Costa Rica, Cote d'Ivoire, Cuba, Djibouti, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Fiji, Gabon, Ghana, Guatemala,Indonesia, Mali, Mauritania, Mexico, Pakistan, Philippines, Poland, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Tunisia, Uganda, Ukraine, Vietnam, Burkina Faso, El Salvador, Gambia, Georgia, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Honduras, India, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Liberia, Mauritius, Moldova, Morocco, Myanmar, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sri Lanka, Suriname, Tanzania, Thailand, Turkey, Yemen and Zambia.
Competition
Our primary competitors in the money transfer and bill payment business include other large money transfer companies and electronic money transmitters, together with hundreds of smaller registered and unregistered money transmitters, as well as certain major national and regional banks, financial institutions and independent sales organizations. Our competition includes The Western Union Company, the leading competitor with revenue approximately three times greater than the next largest competitor. The Western Union Company has a significant competitive advantage due to its greater resources and access to capital for expansion. This may allow them to offer better pricing terms to customers, agents or correspondents, which may result in a loss of our current or potential customers or could force us to lower our prices. In addition to traditional money payment services, new technologies are emerging that compete with traditional money payment services, such as stored-value cards, debit networks and web-based services and digital currencies. Our continued growth also depends upon our ability to compete effectively with these alternative technologies.
Employees
We had approximately 7,100, 6,600 and 6,200 employees as of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. We believe our future success will depend in part on our ability to continue to recruit, retain and motivate qualified management, technical and administrative employees. Currently, no union represents any of our employees, except in one of our Spanish subsidiaries. We experienced no work stoppages or strikes by our workforce in 2018 and we consider relations with our employees to be good.
14

Government Regulation
As discussed below, many of our business activities are subject to regulation in our current markets. In the Money Transfer Segment, we are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations of the U.S., individual U.S. states and foreign governments. These include international, federal and state anti-money laundering laws and regulations, money transfer and payment instrument licensing laws, escheat laws, laws covering consumer privacy, data protection and information security and consumer disclosure and consumer protection laws. Our operations have also been subject to increasingly strict requirements intended to help prevent and detect a variety of illegal financial activity, including money laundering, terrorist financing, unauthorized access to personal customer data and other illegal activities. The more significant of these laws and regulations are discussed below. Noncompliance with these laws and requirements could result in the loss or suspension of licenses or registrations required to provide money transfer services through retail agents, Company owned stores or online. For more discussion, see Item 1A - Risk Factors.
Any further expansion of our activity into areas that are qualified as “financial activity” under local legislation may subject us to licensing and we may be required to comply with various conditions to obtain such licenses. Moreover, the interpretations of bank regulatory authorities as to the activity we currently conduct might change in the future. We monitor our business for compliance with applicable laws or regulations regarding financial activities.
Certain of our European product offerings, including in particular, our money transfer services, merchant acquiring and bill payment products, are regulated services requiring a license under the PSD2, which replaced PSD effective January 13, 2018. Key changes made by PSD2 to PSD include: extension of PSD rules on transparency to additional transactions not currently covered by PSD; enhanced cooperation and information exchange between authorities in the context of authorization and supervision of payment institutions; and increased obligations around the management of operational and security risk, increased obligations relating to complaints handling and additional requirements regarding payment security.

PSD2 requires a license to perform certain defined "payment services" in a European country, which may be extended throughout the Member States through passporting. Conditions for obtaining the license include minimum capital requirements, establishment of procedures for safeguarding of funds, and certain governance and reporting requirements. In addition, certain obligations relating to internal controls and the conduct of business, in particular, consumer disclosure requirements and certain rules regarding the timing and settlement of payments, must be met. We have payment institution licenses in the U.K., France, Germany, and Spain and are complying with these requirements. To date, we have passported our U.K. authorization to several Member States and our Spanish authorization to several host Member States. Additionally, in the U.K., we have obtained an e-money license under the 2EMD. The e-money license allows Euronet to issue e-money and provide the same payment services as a PSD2 licensee. The e-money license imposes certain requirements similar to those of the payment services license, including minimum capital requirements, consumer disclosure and internal controls and can be passported to Member States. Our e-money license holder is currently operating in over twenty-one Member States.
Money Transfer and Payment Instrument Licensing
Licensing requirements in the U.S. are generally driven by the various state banking departments regulating the businesses of money transfers and issuances of payment instruments. Typical requirements include the meeting of minimum net worth requirements, maintaining permissible investments (e.g., cash, agent receivables, and government-backed securities) at levels commensurate with outstanding payment obligations and the filing of a security instrument (typically in the form of a surety bond) to offset the risk of default of trustee obligations by the license holder. We are required by many state regulators to submit ongoing reports of licensed activity, most often on a quarterly or monthly basis, that address changes to agent and branch locations, operating and financial performance, permissible investments and outstanding transmission liabilities. These periodic reports are utilized by the regulator to monitor ongoing compliance with state licensing laws. A number of major state regulators also conduct periodic examinations of license holders and their authorized delegates, generally with a frequency of every one to two years. Examinations are most often comprehensive in nature, addressing both the safety and soundness and overall compliance by the license holder with regard to state and federal regulations. Such examinations are typically performed on-site at the license holder's headquarters or operations center; however, certain states may choose to perform examinations off-site as well.
Money transmitters, issuers of payment instruments and their agents are required to comply with U.S. federal, state and/or foreign anti-money laundering laws and regulations. In summary, our Money Transfer Segment, as well as our agent network, is subject to regulations issued by the different state and foreign national regulators who license us, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), the Bank Secrecy Act as amended by the USA PATRIOT (“BSA”), the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FINCEN”), as well as any existing or future regulations that impact any aspect of our money transfer business.
15

A similar set of regulations applies to our money transfer businesses in most of the foreign countries in which we originate transactions. These laws and regulations include monetary limits for money transfers into or out of a country, rules regarding the foreign currency exchange rates offered, as well as other limitations or rules for which we must maintain compliance.
Regulatory bodies in the U.S. and abroad may impose additional rules on the conduct of our Money Transfer Segment that could have a significant impact on our operations and our agent network. In this regard, the U.S. federal government has implemented U.S. federal regulations for electronic money transfers, including the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, which provides consumer protections for international remittance transfers. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB"), adopted a rule that provides additional protections for consumers who transmit money internationally, including disclosure requirements, cancellation rights and error resolution procedures for consumer complaints. Under U.S. federal law, it is unlawful for any provider of consumer financial products or services to engage in unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices (collectively, "UDAAPs"). The CFPB has rule making and enforcement authority to prevent UDAAPs in connection with transactions for consumer financial products or services. The CFPB audits our compliance with these rules, and we may be subject to fines or penalties for violations of any of such rules.
Escheat Regulations
Our Money Transfer Segment is subject to the unclaimed or abandoned property (i.e., “escheat”) regulations of the United States and certain foreign countries in which we operate. These laws require us to turn over property held by Euronet on behalf of others remaining unclaimed after specified periods of time (i.e., “dormancy” or “escheat” periods). Such abandoned property is generally attributable to the failure of beneficiary parties to claim money transfers or the failure to negotiate money orders, a form of payment instrument. We have policies and programs in place to help us monitor the required information relating to each money transfer or payment instrument for possible eventual reporting to the jurisdiction from which the order was originally received. In the U.S., reporting of unclaimed property by money service companies is performed annually, generally with a due date of on or before November 1. State banking department regulators will typically include a review of Euronet escheat procedures and related filings as part of their examination protocol.
Privacy and Information Security Regulations
Our Money Transfer Segment operations involve the collection and storage of certain types of personal customer data that are subject to privacy and security laws in the U.S. and abroad. In the United States, we are subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”), which requires that financial institutions have in place policies regarding the collection, processing, storage and disclosure of information considered nonpublic personal information. Laws in other countries include the E.U.'s General Data Protection Regulation (2016/679) ("GDPR"), which became effective from May 25, 2018, as well as the laws of other countries. 
The GDPR establishes stringent requirements for the collection and processing of personal information of individuals within the E.U. The GDPR establishes certain rights of individuals regarding personal information processed by companies as well as requirements for information security, and imposes significant fines that may be revenue-based for violation of its requirements. Any failure on our part to meet the requirements of the GDPR could result in the imposition of fines and penalties that could affect our financial results.
We comply with the GLBA and state privacy provisions. In October 2015, the European Court of Justice invalidated the European Commission’s decision of 2000 regarding the transfer of personal data from the E.U. to the United States (known as the "Safe Harbor Decision"). Despite the October 2015 ruling of the European Court of Justice, we believe we remain in compliance with E.U. regulations regarding the transfer of personal data to the United States. 
Recently, as identity theft has been on the rise, there has been increased public attention to concerns about information security and consumer privacy, accompanied by laws and regulations addressing the issue. We believe we are compliant with these laws and regulations; however, this is a rapidly evolving area and there can be no assurance that we will continue to meet the existing and new regulations, which could have a material, adverse impact on our Money Transfer Segment business.
Anti-corruption and Bribery

We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), which prohibits U.S. and other business entities from making improper payments to foreign government officials, political parties or political party officials. We are also subject to the applicable anti-corruption laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, such as the U.K. Bribery Act, thus potentially exposing us to liability and potential penalties in multiple jurisdictions. The anti-corruption provisions of the FCPA are enforced by the United States Department of Justice. In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") requires strict compliance 
16

with certain accounting and internal control standards set forth under the FCPA. Because our services are offered in many countries throughout the world, we face a higher risk associated with FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and other similar laws than many other companies and we have policies and procedures in place to address compliance with the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and other similar laws. Any determination that we have violated these laws could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. Failure to comply with our policies and procedures or the FCPA and other laws can expose Euronet and/or individual employees to potentially severe criminal and civil penalties. Such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Money Transfer Compliance Policies and Programs
We have developed risk-based policies and programs to comply with existing and new laws, regulations and other requirements outlined above, including having dedicated compliance personnel, training programs, automated monitoring systems and support functions for our offices and agents. To assist in managing and monitoring our money laundering and terrorist financing risks, we continue to have our compliance programs, in many countries, independently examined on an annual basis. In addition, we continue to enhance our anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing compliance policy, procedures and monitoring systems, as well as our consumer protection policies and procedures.
Intellectual Property 
Each of our three operating segments utilizes intellectual property which is protected in varying degrees by a combination of trademark, patent and copyright laws, as well as trade secret protection, license and confidentiality agreements.
The brand names of “Ria,” “Ria Financial Services,” “Ria Envia,” “HiFX,” “HiFM,” “xe,” derivations of those brand names and certain other brand names are material to our Money Transfer Segment and are registered trademarks and/or service marks in most of the markets in which our Money Transfer Segment operates. Consumer perception of these brand names is important to the growth prospects of our money transfer business. We also hold a U.S. patent on a card-based money transfer and bill payment system that allows transactions to be initiated primarily through POS terminals and integrated cash register systems.
With respect to our EFT Processing Segment, we have registered or applied for registration of our trademarks, including the names “Euronet” and “Bankomat” and/or our blue diamond logo, as well as other trade names in most markets in which these trademarks are used. Certain trademark authorities have notified us that they consider these trademarks to be generic and, therefore, not protected by trademark laws. This determination does not affect our ability to use the Euronet trademark in those markets, but it would prevent us from stopping other parties from using it in competition with Euronet. We have registered the “Euronet” trademark in the class of ATM machines in Germany, the U.K. and certain other Western European countries. We have filed pending applications and/or obtained patents for a number of our new software products and our processing technology, including certain top-up services.
With respect to our epay Segment, we have filed trademark applications for the “epay” brand in the U.S., U.K., the E.U. through a Community Trademark application, Brazil, India, Australia and New Zealand. The epay trademark has issued to registration in the U.S., U.K., the E.U., Australia, New Zealand and Brazil. The trademark application in India is still pending. We cannot be certain that we are entitled to use the epay trademark in any markets other than those in which we have registered the trademark. We have filed patent applications for some of our POS top-up and certain other products in support of epay technology. Certain patents have been granted while others have been refused or are still pending. We also hold a patent license covering certain of epay's operations in the U.S.
Technology in the areas in which we operate is developing very rapidly, and we are aware that many other companies have filed patent applications for products, processes and services similar to those we provide. The procedures of the U.S. patent office make it impossible for us to predict whether our patent applications will be approved or will be granted priority dates that are earlier than other patents that have been filed for similar products or services. Moreover, many “process patents” have been filed in the U.S. over recent years covering processes that are in wide use in the money transfer, EFT and prepaid processing industries. If any of these patents are considered to cover technology that has been incorporated into our systems, we may be required to obtain additional licenses and pay royalties to the holders of such patents to continue to use the affected technology or be prohibited from continuing the offering of such services if licenses are not obtained. This could materially and adversely affect our business.
