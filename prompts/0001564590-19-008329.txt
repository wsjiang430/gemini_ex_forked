Item 1. Business
Overview
 We are a leading provider of smart mobility technology solutions and services throughout the United States, Canada and Europe. We provide integrated technology solutions and services which include toll and violations management, title and registration, automated safety solutions, and other data driven solutions to our customers, which include rental car companies (“RACs”), fleet management companies (“FMCs”), other large fleet owners, municipalities, school districts and violation issuing authorities. Our solutions simplify the smart mobility ecosystem by utilizing what we believe are industry leading capabilities, information and technology expertise, and integrated hardware and software to efficiently facilitate the automated processing of tolls and violations for hundreds of agencies and millions of end users annually, while also making cities and roadways safer for everyone.
 Based in Mesa, Arizona, we operate through two primary segments – Commercial Services and Government Solutions. Through our Commercial Services segment, we believe we are the market leading provider of automated toll and violations management and title and registration solutions to RACs, FMCs and other large fleet owners in the United States and Canada. In Europe, we work with violation issuing authorities and specialize in the identification, notification, and collection of unpaid traffic, parking, and public transportation related violations incurred by vehicles registered in a country other than that in which the violation occurred. Through our Government Solutions segment, we believe we are the market leading provider of automated safety solutions to municipalities, counties, school districts and law enforcement agencies (which are collectively referred to herein as “local government agencies”), including services and technology that enable photo enforcement via road safety camera programs related to red light, speed, school bus, and city bus lanes.
 Segments 
 Commercial Services (also referred to as Tolling & Fleet) 
 Our Commercial Services segment generated approximately $222.6 million in revenue for 2018, or approximately 60% of our total revenue. The Commercial Services segment is the market leading provider of automated toll and violations management and title and registration solutions to RACs, FMCs and other large fleet owners in North America. Through our established relationships with more than 50 individual tolling authorities throughout the United States, we provide an automated and outsourced administrative solution for our customers while also providing a value-added convenience for vehicle drivers and benefits to the tolling and issuing authorities. Without our toll and violations management solutions, our customers would bear the expense and administrative burden of matching tolls or violations to the responsible vehicle and driver, and then either transferring liability or paying the fee or fine directly (for which it may then need to bill the driver) – in either case within specified time periods to avoid the potential imposition of penalties. We mitigate these risks by ensuring timely payment for tolls and violations incurred by our customers’ vehicles or by performing timely transfers of liability on our customers’ behalf, and then billing and collecting from the driver as applicable. We also manage regional toll transponder installation and vehicle association, an especially critical and highly complex component for RAC and FMC customers, to ensure that the transponder (and associated toll transactions) are associated with the correct vehicle. 
 We have long-standing relationships with the three largest RACs in the United States – The Hertz Corporation, Avis Budget Group and Enterprise Holdings, Inc. – among others, as well as the six largest FMCs in the United States, which are Element, ARI, Enterprise Fleet Management, Wheels, LeasePlan and Donlen. We provide coverage for more than 95% of all toll roads in the United States and currently one toll road in Canada, processing more than 200 million toll transactions and 2.2 million traffic violations in 2018. Following the acquisition of Euro Parking Collection (“EPC”) in April 2018, we extended our customer base to include violation issuing authorities in Europe and expanded our commercial services to include identification, notification, and collection of unpaid traffic, parking, and public transportation related violations incurred by vehicle drivers not originating in the country where the violation occurred.

Government Solutions 
 Our Government Solutions segment generated approximately $147.5 million in revenue for 2018, or approximately 40% of our total revenue. This segment works with local government agencies to help make cities and roadways safer for everyone through automated safety solutions. We provide local government agencies with road safety cameras to detect and process traffic violations for red light, speed, school bus, and city bus lanes. Our proprietary hardware and software technologies provide local government agencies the information, data, and automated end-to-end administrative capabilities to enforce traffic violations through photo enforcement. On behalf of our customers, we own, install, maintain, and manage automated safety solution hardware and software that processes event data, applies customer specific rules and connects a traffic violation to the responsible driver or vehicle owner. Additionally, upon law enforcement’s determination that a violation has occurred, we manage the citation mailing, billing, and other administrative tasks on behalf of many of our customers.
 We are a critical partner to local government agencies across the United States, helping to facilitate and increase public safety, enhance law enforcement officer safety and act as a police force multiplier by allowing law enforcement to focus on serious crimes rather than routine traffic violations. We currently have more than 4,400 red light, speed, school bus and city bus lane road safety cameras installed across approximately 200 jurisdictions and school districts in 17 states, the District of Columbia and one Canadian province. On an annual basis, we process approximately 8.5 million violations on behalf of our municipality and school district customers, including New York City, Seattle, Washington D.C., Austin Independent School District, Chicago, Orlando, Dallas and Atlanta Independent School System.
 Recent Developments 
 We completed the strategic acquisitions of Highway Toll Administration (“HTA”) and EPC in March and April of 2018, respectively, which expanded the market presence of our Commercial Services segment.
 HTA 
 Founded in 2002, HTA is a provider of toll management solutions to customers in the United States RAC industry, offering services similar to our toll management services. HTA’s largest customer relationships were with Avis Budget Group and Enterprise Holdings Inc., in addition to other RACs such as Advantage, Silvercar and Sixt. Prior to the acquisition, there was no customer overlap for the same product between us and HTA, allowing for significant customer diversification and growth through the combination. 
EPC 
 Founded in 1988 with operations in London and Budapest, EPC built an established presence with issuing authorities in approximately 15 European countries. Issuing authorities are primarily comprised of public and police authorities, councils, municipalities, national government agencies, toll road operators and private parking companies. EPC services approximately 450 customers in more than 18 languages and more than 10 currencies while working with approximately 30 different vehicle licensing authorities and issuing to vehicle owners or drivers in more than 130 countries. EPC’s European presence, integration with issuing authorities, and expansive billing and customer service capabilities offer us a platform to expand into Europe for RAC and FMC customers. 
The Industries in Which We Operate 
 Tolling 
 Tolling is an important feature of the United States transportation landscape, with United States tolling authorities collecting more than $13.8 billion in toll revenues in 2015. In 2015, drivers took more than 5.7 billion trips on United States tolled roads and crossings. As a result, tolling is one of the most effective and equitable ways to pay for highway infrastructure. In addition to the overall growth in tolling as reflected in the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration’s tracking of total toll bridge, tunnel and road mileage, there is also a growing movement towards cashless and all-electronic tolling, which allows for more convenient, accurate and reliable processing and collection of toll incurrence fees and mitigates congestion on toll roads. The tolling industry is highly fragmented and complex as it is comprised of more than 50 tolling authorities, each operating as independent organizations with specific coverage regions and disparate technology platforms. 
 6

Commercial Fleet 
 Our Commercial Services customers consist of RACs, FMCs and other large fleet owners. The $30 billion United States RAC industry is highly consolidated, with three companies accounting for a significant majority of United States RAC revenues in 2018. In addition to these larger nationwide RACs, smaller independent companies operate regionally throughout the United States. The industry is currently being driven by an increase in the average number of days a vehicle is rented. The industry is also being impacted by the rapid growth in the ride sharing market through recent partnerships with ride share providers like Uber and Lyft to rent vehicles to their independent drivers, leading to additional rental transactions. Management believes the European RAC market, while more fragmented than the U.S. market, is large in size. According to Automotive Fleet Magazine, there are approximately 6.4 million fleet vehicles in the United States, approximately 3 million of which are under management by FMCs. The fleet industry in North America is primarily centered on vocational vehicles utilized for transporting people along with the tools, parts and equipment required to perform their jobs, largely insulating the industry from disruptions caused by today’s ride share and car share services. In Europe, the FMC market is estimated to be more than 6 million vehicles, with over half under management by the top five European FMCs. 
Automated Safety 
 As the number of vehicle miles traveled continues to increase and cities and municipalities struggle to deal with the challenges of managing traffic enforcement, red-light, speed and school bus stop arm cameras continue to play a prominent role in comprehensive safety initiatives. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, speeding and red-light running cause nearly 11,000 fatalities each year.  Studies from organizations like the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (“IIHS”) have found cameras to be an effective tool for law enforcement and other agencies to reduce the number of traffic-related violations, collisions, injuries and fatalities. A 2013 IIHS study found that red-light cameras reduce fatalities by 24%, and a 2015 IIHS study found that speed cameras reduced incapacitating or fatal crashes by as much as 39%. Additionally, programs like Vision Zero, a collaborative campaign helping communities reach their goals of eliminating all traffic fatalities and severe injuries, across most major U.S. cities, are driving capital investment to make meaningful strides in traffic safety.
Our Strengths 
 Market Leader with Highly Differentiated and Proprietary Platforms 
 We have leading market shares in our Commercial Services and Government Solutions segments, supported by our comprehensive portfolio of smart mobility technology solutions and services meeting the needs of our customers. Our outsourcing solutions make otherwise complex, time consuming, high touch and manual tasks seamless and automated while delivering consistently efficient and reliable outcomes. Our ability to integrate with the disparate technology systems of our customers, tolling authorities and violation issuing authorities has created a uniquely scaled and differentiated platform to meet customers’ existing needs as well as introduce innovative products to meet their future needs. Further, we are the market leader in automated safety solutions, holding estimated market shares as a percentage of cameras of 46% in red light, 55% in speed, and 48% in school bus road safety cameras. Our hardware and software platform is supported by a portfolio of patents and other intellectual property, allowing us to sustain our market leading positions. 
Recurring Revenue Business Model with Diversified Blue-Chip Customer Base 
 We have a high recurring revenue business model that provides strong forward revenue visibility, which management estimates to be 98% recurring. Within our Commercial Services segment, our contracts are typically exclusive within the United States and multi-year in nature, resulting in long-standing relationships with our customers. Within our Government Solutions segment, our contracts are typically multi-year in nature and often include a series of automatic renewals. Opportunities within Government Solutions are occasionally put out to bid via a request for proposal (“RFP”) for which we may compete against other providers. Since the beginning of 2018, our Government Solutions segment has won 50% of the RFPs for which we have responded for the provision of photo enforcement services.

High Value Proposition Benefiting Both Customers and Consumers 
 We help solve the increasingly complex and continuously evolving requirements of our Commercial Services customers. We alleviate the cost the customer would otherwise be responsible for from incurring fees and penalties related to tolls and violations by matching tolls and violations to the responsible vehicle driver, or acting as a backstop when a toll violation would otherwise occur. We utilize our unique software platform, integrated with more than 50 individual tolling authorities across the United States and connected to the enterprise systems of our Commercial Services customers, to manage toll and violation incurrences between the applicable issuing authority and the customer’s vehicle. In addition to limiting the potential for costly fines and penalties that can exponentially impact owners of large vehicle fleets when tolls or violations are not accurately or timely paid, the ability to operate a comprehensive national toll and violations management program on behalf of our customers alleviates the significant administrative burden and cost of managing a complex in-house solution. Further, we provide a convenient and readily available solution to our Commercial Services customers, allowing their drivers to seamlessly utilize cashless and all-electronic toll roads without their own individual transponder or the need to stop to pay cash for tolls (where available). 
 Our Government Solutions products, including red light, speed, school bus and city bus lane road safety cameras, are effective tools in helping local government agencies increase traffic safety. Our automated safety solutions have proven effective in changing driver behavior in areas identified as traffic safety problem zones resulting in reduced traffic accidents and congestion. These products help to serve as police force multipliers by allowing law enforcement to focus on serious crimes rather than routine traffic violations.
 Sustainable Competitive Advantage in the Marketplace 
 We believe we have built a unique and sustainable competitive advantage through a combination of unmatched scale, proprietary hardware and software and strong, differentiated relationships that would be difficult for our competitors to replicate. 
 We manage toll and violation solutions for the more than 6 million vehicles owned by the largest RAC and FMC companies and processed more than 200 million toll transactions in 2018. The United States tolling industry is highly fragmented and is comprised of more than 50 tolling authorities operating as independent organizations with specific coverage regions and disparate technology platforms, which require customized software integrations to manage on a national scale. 
 We currently have approximately 4,400 road safety cameras installed across approximately 200 jurisdictions and school districts in 17 states, the District of Columbia and one Canadian province. On behalf of our customers, we own, install, maintain, and manage automated safety solution hardware and software that processes event data, applies customer specific rules and connects a traffic violation to the responsible driver or vehicle owner.
 We believe that replicating our Commercial Services and Government Solutions segments, whether in-house or through a competing third-party, would require a significant investment of time, capital and industry-specific knowledge. Within Commercial Services, a competitor would need the ability to complete the complex reconciliation processes involving large numbers of unique transactions across the numerous independent tolling authorities in the United States, prefund toll incurrences on behalf of customers, accurately match the toll transaction to the vehicle and driver, bill according to customer specific rules and offer customer service to end consumers. Within Government Solutions, the combination of our seasoned account management team and proprietary technology platform creates a strong competitive advantage. Additionally, we employ a government relations team that manages a network of state and local lobbyists to shape legislation in order to help customers achieve their desired traffic safety outcomes, further strengthening the overall customer relationship.

Strong Financial Results, Cash Flow Generation and Disciplined Cost Structures Provide a Platform for Future Growth 
 We have demonstrated strong and consistent growth, with service revenues improving at a compounded annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 23.5% since 2015. Excluding the HTA and EPC acquisitions, our revenue CAGR for the same period would be 9.0%. Our recurring revenue business model, combined with our ability to win new business, provides visibility, stability and a platform for future growth. Our scalable technology platform provides strong operating leverage and has driven increased operating margins. Further, we utilize a disciplined approach to capital expenditures, optimizing the lifetime value of cameras. The combination of high margin products and a disciplined approach to capital expenditures allows us to generate strong cash flow. 
Experienced Management Team with a Track Record of Success 
 Our management team has a proven track record of operational excellence, financial performance, growth and ongoing product innovation. The management team, led by President and CEO David M. Roberts, collectively has over 100 years of experience and has a deep knowledge of the industry. The management team has further strengthened our competitive positioning with the recent HTA and EPC transactions, expanding our solution offering and customer base and diversifying into new markets.
Growth Strategies 
 Benefit from Strong Industry Tailwinds 
 We believe there is significant opportunity in both Commercial Services and Government Solutions to leverage strong industry momentum and trends. In Commercial Services, the number of toll roads is continuing to increase and there is continued migration towards cashless and all-electronic tolling. In Government Solutions, the public attention given to traffic safety issues for drivers, pedestrians, bicyclists, and law enforcement is intensifying. 
 According to 2014 IBTTA estimates, annual tolling industry revenues in the United States could reach $65 to 70 billion by 2030. This increase in revenue is expected to be driven by an increase in the number of toll roads, including new express and high occupancy lanes in urban areas, dynamic tolling based on congestion pricing which allow toll rates to fluctuate based on real-time traffic trends, U.S. states that do not currently utilize toll roads implementing interstate tolling, and an overall need to fund a growing list of infrastructure maintenance and construction needs. In addition, from 2010 to 2015, many toll roads transitioned to either partially or completely cashless or all electronic and the tolling industry experienced a 76% increase in revenues from cashless and all-electronic toll transactions during this same period according to IBTTA. Both trends create significant opportunities for us to expand our market presence while developing relationships with both new and existing RACs, FMCs, consumers, and tolling authorities. 
 The increase in the number of vehicle miles traveled each year and a heightened public awareness of traffic safety has highlighted the need for smart technology solutions to address traffic safety issues. We believe that as public focus intensifies, the demand for our Government Solutions offerings will grow as well, and that we are positioned to take advantage of these opportunities. Since the beginning of 2017, our Government Solutions segment has won 50% of the RFPs to which we have responded for the provision of photo enforcement services.
 Expand Platform with New Products 
 We are an industry leader in the deployment of products and services that meet the increasingly complex and continuously evolving requirements of both existing and new customers. We are continuously looking toward the future, ensuring the development of relevant solutions today that will work tomorrow. We seek to understand developing customer, consumer, and government trends that will shape tomorrow’s smart mobility experiences both in the United States and internationally, all in an effort to ensure more people around the world reach their destination safely and easily.

In the Commercial Services segment, Peasy, our cloud-based, pay-as-you-go tolling solution, launched on September 12, 2018. Peasy automatically gives consumers complete protection from toll violations on many toll roads in the United States by leveraging our existing integrations with tolling authorities. With an easy and convenient sign-up process through a mobile phone application or the internet, drivers can use most cashless or all-electronic tolls within the United States knowing that they will not incur costly toll violations, all managed through a single account with Peasy. We intend to grow Peasy into a comprehensive, single-account mobility solution, adding additional services in the future.
In the Government Solutions segment, in 2018 we launched our smart and safe bus solution called CrossingGuard+, which, in addition to using exterior cameras to enforce illegally passing vehicles, uses interior cameras to ensure rider and driver safety and offers on-board student WiFi and RFID identification to give school officials real-time rider status information and historical ridership reporting. Additionally, we recently launched a handheld speed detection camera that gives municipalities and law enforcement agencies the ability to process and issue photo enforcement citations directly from the roadside. These cameras empower local law enforcement to review photos or video in real-time and at the site of the potential offense and determine whether a violation has occurred. If the law enforcement officer deems an offense has occurred, we process the data and mail the citation along with the photo evidence to the violator as well as facilitate the violator’s payment to the local government agency.
 Leverage Existing Platform and Solutions in New and Growing End Markets 
 In addition to the strong positive trends in our existing RAC and FMC end markets, we believe leveraging our differentiated capabilities into new and growing end markets, such as ride sharing, car sharing, autonomous vehicles, and over-the-road (“OTR”) trucking fleets, provides very attractive growth opportunities. The ride sharing and car sharing market, which includes vehicles leased to individual drivers, gives us a low-risk opportunity to grow Commercial Services revenues while at the same time insulating us from any market shift between ride sharing, car sharing and RACs. Further, this growth prospect comes at little additional investment as we are able to leverage the same technologies and solutions we have already developed for our RAC and FMC customers. We are also currently working with original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) to integrate our solutions, including Peasy, into the OEMs’ own consumer-facing platforms and applications, and we believe that, as an already established leader, we are well-positioned to be a first mover and to become a provider of choice in these new end markets. Additionally, the OTR market provides another significant untapped growth opportunity for us as there are approximately 3 million OTR trucks in the United States. OTR drivers are responsible for driving semi- or tractor-trailer trucks over long distances. 
 Urban enforcement and citation processing solutions in the smart city movement is also a significant opportunity for us. As one example, according to Technavio, the smart parking industry in the United States is forecasted to grow by approximately 20% by 2019 and currently has no dominant players. As with ride sharing, autonomous vehicles and OTR companies, our existing technologies and solutions could be adopted to take advantage of this unaddressed market, providing an additional avenue for growth. 
 In addition, Government Solutions could leverage our long-standing relationships with municipal customers to provide other smart mobility technology solutions, such as automatic license plate recognition and surveillance, and new developing technologies, such as smart lighting and connected vehicle technology. 
 Expand Global Footprint 
 We believe there is significant opportunity to expand into attractive markets across Europe and beyond, and to that end, we have established a subsidiary in the Netherlands to serve as our European headquarters from which we can launch our RAC and FMC business in Europe. We also intend to leverage our recent acquisition of EPC, which has an established European presence and approximately 450 current customers, to further bolster our growth into the European market.
 10

In addition to our established business in North America, through EPC we now have the capabilities to serve customers in more than 18 languages and more than 10 currencies and to leverage existing connections with approximately 30 vehicle licensing authorities for whom we bill violators in more than 130 countries. Given there is no pan-European competitor, we have an opportunity to provide existing and new RAC and FMC customers with a convenient and effective solution similar to our current offering in the United States. As we expand our direct-to-consumer offerings in the United States, the EPC platform provides an excellent opportunity to do the same in Europe. We estimate the European consumer tolling and tolling violations market to be almost twice as large as the United States market, and believe there is no other company better positioned to take advantage of these opportunities. 
 Pursue Accretive Acquisitions 
 In addition to organic growth initiatives, we have significant opportunities to increase our competitive positioning and strengthen our portfolio of products and solutions through strategic acquisitions. We have demonstrated the ability to identify and execute strategic acquisitions, as we did with Sunshine State Tag Agency in 2016 as well as HTA and EPC in 2018. We constantly monitor the market for potential acquisition targets, which are evaluated based on their potential strategic impact, including growth potential, synergies, end-market development, customer relationships, technology, and cash flow. Our management team has a strong track record of integrating acquisitions and driving synergies, and has identified a strong pipeline for future acquisitions. 
Products 
 Commercial Services 
 Toll management solutions.
We provide fully outsourced toll management solutions for our RAC and FMC customers while also providing a value-added convenience for vehicle drivers via our established relationships and integrations with more than 50 individual tolling authorities throughout the United States. This comprehensive network allows RAC and FMC drivers the convenience of using cashless and all-electronic tolls. Additionally, this service helps prevent the liability and business disruption of costly toll violations incurred by vehicles owned by RAC and FMC customers and eliminates their need to manage a nationwide program internally. Our proprietary software technology and hardware allow us to effectively match a toll to the specific RAC or FMC vehicle and driver so that the toll can accurately and reliably be billed and collected on behalf of, or directly from, the RAC or FMC. Toll management solutions accounted for approximately 50% of our 2018 revenues. 
 Violations management solutions.
Our violations management solutions process violations incurred by the drivers of RAC and FMC vehicles by working with more than 8,000 domestic violation issuing authorities (more than 400 of which we are directly integrated with) to either pay the fine on behalf of the vehicle owner (for which we are able to bill the vehicle driver) or to transfer liability directly to the vehicle driver. Vehicle-issued violations include parking and photo enforcement violations. We hold the leading market position with operations in all 50 U.S. states. In Europe, we specialize in the identification, notification, and collection of unpaid traffic, parking and public transport related fees, charges, and penalties issued to foreign registered vehicles or persons on behalf of issuing authorities in approximately 15 European countries. Violation management solutions accounted for approximately 7% of our 2018 revenues. 
 Title and registration solutions.
Our title and registration solutions provide RAC and FMC customers and consumers with an integrated, end-to-end solution for managing vehicle titles and registrations and annual renewals. We provide automated title and registration solutions by leveraging connections with individual departments of motor vehicles for electronic title and registration processing in 17 states. Title and registration solutions accounted for approximately 3% of our 2018 revenues. 
 11

Government Solutions 
 We serve as a value-add partner to local government agencies by providing road safety cameras that promote traffic safety and reduce traffic violations. We work with our customers to identify problematic traffic areas and install, maintain, and manage the technology platform needed to capture images or videos of drivers committing traffic violations. Red light cameras are placed at intersections to capture vehicles running red lights. Similarly, speed safety cameras are used to capture vehicles exceeding speed limits, either on a fixed basis or in a mobile platform, and often in school zones. School bus cameras are fixed to the side of buses to capture vehicles passing school buses with extended stop arms. Finally, bus lane cameras are designed to capture vehicles illegally driving in restricted bus lanes. 
 Applying rules specified by each customer, we automatically send the captured event to the designated enforcement agency of the customer, where an authorized individual determines if a violation occurred. Red light cameras, speed cameras, school bus cameras, and city bus lane cameras for red light, speed, school bus and city bus lanes accounted for approximately 38% of our 2018 revenues. Other segment revenue consists primarily of ancillary revenue streams, including product revenues and other ancillary services. 
 Customers 
 We have a diverse customer base across the United States, Canada, and Europe. We are a top provider of toll management solutions, violations management solutions, and title and registration solutions for nearly every major RAC and FMC provider nationwide, including The Hertz Corporation, Avis Budget Group, Enterprise Holdings, Inc., Fox Rent a Car, Advantage Rent A Car, Sixt, Element, ARI, Donlen and Wheels. In addition, we provide automated safety solutions to local government agencies including New York City, Seattle, Washington D.C., Austin Independent School District, Chicago, Orlando, Dallas, and the Atlanta Independent School System. For many of our customers, we provide more than one product or service offering, addressing the diverse and varied needs of our clients. 
Competition 
 Although there is no single competitor that provides a similarly broad suite of solutions, we face competition in certain automated safety solutions from other vendors in the areas of red light, school bus and speed photo enforcement. We also face competition from both our own customers, as they may choose to invest in their own internal solutions, and new technologies, as we must continue to innovate for our offerings to remain competitive. 
Intellectual Property 
 We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property. We take steps to protect new intellectual property to safeguard our ongoing technological innovations and strengthen our brand, and believe we take appropriate action against infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights by others. We review third-party intellectual property rights to help avoid infringement, and to identify strategic opportunities. 
 Our general policy is to seek patent protection for those inventions likely to be incorporated into our products and services or where obtaining such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position. We own approximately 60 U.S. and foreign-issued patents and pending patent applications, including patents and rights to patent applications acquired through strategic transactions, which relate to various aspects of our products and technology. Our patent portfolio evolves as new patents are awarded to us and as older patents expire. Patents expire at various dates, generally 20 years from their original filing dates. While we believe that our portfolio of patents and applications has value, in general no single patent is essential to our business or any individual segment. In addition, any of our proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or may not provide significant competitive advantages. 
 12

Our business relies on both internally developed and externally licensed software to operate and provide our systems and deliver our services. We claim copyright on all internally developed software. We generally rely on common law protection for our copyrighted works. In addition, we rely on maintaining source code confidentiality to assure our market competitiveness. With respect to externally sourced software, we rely on contracts assuring our continued access for our business usage. 
 We have approximately 86 registrations and pending applications in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions for trademarks and service marks, reflecting our many products and services. These registrations and applications include our historic brands, as well as Verra Mobility. These marks may have a perpetual life, subject to periodic renewal and may be subject to cancellation or invalidation based on certain use requirements and third-party challenges, or on other grounds. We vigorously enforce and protect our marks. 
 Government Regulation 
 We are subject to various local, state and federal laws, regulations and administrative practices regulating matters such as data privacy, photo enforcement, consumer protection, procurement, licensing requirements, anti-kickback, equal employment, minimum wages and the environment, among others. Our operations are subject to regulation by various U.S. federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Transportation, (“USDOT”), the Federal Trade Commission, (“FTC”), the Federal Communications Commission, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as comparable state and local agencies, including the departments of transportation, departments of motor vehicles, and offices of inspector general. Following the acquisition of EPC and in connection with our European expansion efforts, we are now subject to laws, regulations and administrative practices addressing many of these same matters in Europe, including those specifically relating to accessing and use of information obtained from vehicle licensing authorities, as well as European regulations to traffic enforcement and collections. 
 As part of our business, we process, collect, use and disclose personal information directly or for our customers and, therefore, are subject to various laws protecting privacy and security of personal information, including the U.S. Driver Privacy Protection Act and the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) in the European Union (the “E.U.”). We are also subject to similar restrictions and audit requirements pursuant to our contracts with the organizations from which we gain access to personal information, such as departments of motor vehicles and the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System. Privacy laws and regulations are constantly evolving and changing, are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among countries and state and local jurisdictions, or conflict with other rules. As we expand our operations in foreign countries following the EPC acquisition, or as U.S. federal or state law changes, our liability exposure and the complexity and cost of compliance with data and privacy requirements, including the GDPR, will increase. Laws and practices regarding handling and use of personal and other information by companies have also come under increased public scrutiny, and governmental authorities, consumer agencies and consumer advocacy groups have called for increased regulation and changes in industry practices. 
 Automated photo enforcement camera programs in the United States are typically regulated at the state and local level, not the federal level. Since 2010, there have been over 1,500 pieces of legislation introduced nationwide related to the photo enforcement industry. In general, photo enforcement is administrated by local government agencies, under either state enabling legislation or under home rule authority established under the relevant state constitution. Where enabling legislation is not required, local ordinances impose further restrictions within a given jurisdiction. Whether in a state requiring enabling legislation or in home rule states where municipalities pass ordinances permitting photo enforcement, if the legislation or ordinance is subsequently repealed, not renewed if required, or if the authority for a local ordinance is revoked, photo enforcement activities would stop. At times, state Attorneys General have issued opinions interpreting photo enforcement laws and the permissibility of certain practices or other requirements of practice that further restrict private activities. For example, the Attorneys General of Arizona, Tennessee and Virginia have each issued opinions in recent years that impacted photo enforcement activities. 
 13

State and local regulation affect our Commercial Services segment as well, particularly with respect to tolling. Over the past few years, bills have been introduced in multiple states to limit whether and how much RACs can charge for the use of a toll transponder, limit the administrative penalties and fees that can be assessed for processing tolls, and/or impose increased disclosure requirements on RACs with respect to tolling charges. In addition, there has been an increase in interest and greater focus on RAC tolling programs from state Attorneys General related to tolling issues from a consumer protection perspective.
 Our Government Solutions customers are typically local government agencies, and our operations within this segment are therefore subject to state and local procurement laws pertaining to gifts and entertainment, payments of commissions and contingency fees, conflicts of interest, licensing and permitting requirements and other matters. These laws are overseen by different government agencies, depending on the jurisdiction, including departments of procurements services, contracting offices and offices of inspector general. In large municipalities, many of which have their own offices of the inspector general, these laws and regulations tend to be much more detailed and impose greater restrictions.
 To successfully navigate this regulatory landscape, we have a dedicated government relations team that works with state legislators and local authorities, often with the help of lobbyists and consultants, to track and help support favorable camera-enforcement safety and toll-related legislation. Through this network, we have a presence in every state in which our Government Solutions segment does business. These lobbying activities are subject to state and local lobbying regulations and registration requirements. 
 In connection with the installation of photo enforcement systems, we or our customers routinely obtain permits from various state and local permitting authorities, and we monitor our compliance with the rules and regulations of the USDOT and state departments of transportation relating to matters such as training, policies and procedures. As a government contractor providing photo enforcement services directly or through subcontractors (including design, engineering, construction, installation, and maintenance) in various locations throughout the country, we are at times required to obtain licenses regarding general contracting, performance of engineering services, performance of electrical work, performance of private investigative work and processing license plate and related personal information, and periodically receives notices from regulatory authorities regarding these matters and inquiring as to our compliance with the applicable state and local laws and regulations. 
 We believe we are in substantial compliance with the laws and regulations that regulate our business. There are, however, significant uncertainties involving the application of various legal requirements, the violation of which could result in, among other things, fines, penalties, revocation of permits or licenses, cessation of operations in a given jurisdiction and other adverse consequences.
