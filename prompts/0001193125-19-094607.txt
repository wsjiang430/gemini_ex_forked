Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

General 
 PermRock Royalty Trust (the Trust) is a Delaware statutory trust formed on November 22, 2017 under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act pursuant to a trust agreement dated November 22, 2017, as amended and restated on May 4, 2018, by and among Boaz Energy II, LLC (Boaz Energy), as trustor, Simmons Bank, as Trustee (the Trustee), and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as Delaware Trustee (the Delaware Trustee) (such amended and restated trust agreement, as amended to date, the Trust Agreement). The Trusts affairs are administered by the Trustee, which maintains its offices at 2200 West 7th Street, Suite 210, P.O. Box 470727 Fort Worth, Texas 76147. 
 The Trust was created to acquire and hold the Net Profits Interest for the benefit of the Trust unitholders pursuant to an agreement between Boaz Energy, the Trustee and the Delaware Trustee. The affairs of the Trust are managed by Simmons Bank, as Trustee. Boaz Energy has no ability to manage the operations of the Trust, and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, does not owe any fiduciary duties or liabilities to the Trust or the unitholders. In addition, Wilmington Trust, National Association is the Delaware Trustee of the Trust. The Delaware Trustee has only minimal rights and duties as are necessary to satisfy the requirements of the Delaware Statutory Trust Act. 
 In connection with the closing of the initial public offering of Trust units and pursuant to the Conveyance of Net Profits Interest (the Conveyance) effective May 4, 2018, Boaz Energy conveyed the Net Profits Interest to the Trust in exchange for Trust units. The Net Profits Interest entitles the Trust to receive 80% of the net profits from the sale of oil and natural gas production from the Underlying Properties. A description of the Underlying Properties is included under Item 2. Properties. The Net Profits Interest is passive in nature and neither the Trust nor the Trustee has any control over, or responsibility for, costs relating to the operation of the Underlying Properties. 
 Immediately following the Conveyance, Boaz Energy completed an initial public offering of 6,250,000 of its Trust units. Upon completion of the offering, Boaz Energy owned 5,915,732 Trust units of the 12,165,732 Trust units issued and outstanding. 
 The Trusts purpose is to own the Net Profits Interest, to distribute to the Trust unitholders cash that the Trust receives in respect of the Net Profits Interest and to perform certain administrative functions in respect of the Net Profits Interest and the Trust units. Other than the foregoing activities, the Trust does not conduct any operations or activities. The Trust derives all or substantially all of its income and cash flow from the Net Profits Interest. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Trust is treated as a grantor trust and not as an unincorporated business entity. 
 The Trust has made, and will continue to make, monthly cash distributions of all of its monthly cash receipts, after deduction of fees and expenses for the administration of the Trust and any cash reserves, to holders of its Trust units as of the applicable record date on or before the 10th business day after the record date. The Trusts first distribution related to sales from production from January and February of 2018 and production expenses for the months of January, February and a portion of March of 2018. All distributions following the first distribution generally relate to sales from a one-month period. 
 The Trustee 
 The affairs of the Trust are managed by the Trustee. Boaz Energy has no ability to manage the operations of the Trust, and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, does not owe any fiduciary duties or liabilities to the Trust or the Trust unitholders. 
 
1 


 The Trust has no employees. Administrative functions are performed by the Trustee pursuant to the Trust Agreement. The Trustee has no authority over or responsibility for, and no involvement with, any aspect of the oil and gas operations or other activities on the Underlying Properties. The duties of the Trustee are specified in the Trust Agreement and by the laws of the state of Delaware, except as modified by the Trust Agreement. The Trustees principal duties consist of: 
 

 | collecting cash attributable to the Net Profits Interest;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


 | paying expenses, charges and obligations of the Trust from the Trusts assets;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | distributing distributable cash to the Trust unitholders;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


 | causing to be prepared and distributed a tax information report for each Trust unitholder and causing tax returns on behalf of the Trust to be prepared and filed;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | causing to be prepared and filed reports required to be filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and by the rules of any securities exchange or quotation system on which the Trust Units are listed or admitted to trading;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | causing to be prepared and filed a reserve report by or for the Trust by independent reserve engineers as of December 31 of each year in accordance with criteria established by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | establishing, evaluating and maintaining a system of internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | enforcing the rights under certain agreements; and
--+---------------------------------------------------


 | taking any action it deems necessary, desirable or advisable to best achieve the purposes of the Trust.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In connection with the formation of the Trust, the Trust entered into several agreements with Boaz Energy that impose obligations upon Boaz Energy that are enforceable by the Trustee on behalf of the Trust, including the Conveyance and a registration rights agreement. The Trustee has the power and authority under the Trust Agreement to enforce these agreements on behalf of the Trust. Additionally, the Trustee may from time to time supplement or amend the Conveyance and the registration rights agreement to which the Trust is a party without the approval of Trust unitholders, if such supplement or amendment does not have a material adverse effect on the Trust unitholders, in order to comply with changes in applicable law, or to affect the intent expressed in the initial public offering prospectus. 
 Under the Trust Agreement, following the monthly period ended April 30, 2019, the Trustee is authorized to retain cash up to $1.0 million from the distributions the Trust receives to be used by the Trust in the event that its cash on hand (including available cash reserves) is not sufficient to pay ordinary course administrative expenses as they become due. The Trustee is authorized to retain cash only in such amounts as the Trustee deems appropriate to pay for future liabilities of the Trust. Accordingly, following the monthly period ended April 30, 2019, the Trustee will retain cash from distributions in amounts as the Trustee determines, but not less than $25,000 per month or more than $100,000 per month and, at such time as the Trusts cash reserve equals or exceeds $1.0 million, the Trustee, on behalf of the Trust, will release the Letter of Credit (as described below under Item 7. Trustees Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital Resources). 
 Each month, the Trustee pays Trust obligations and expenses and distributes to the Trust unitholders the remaining proceeds received from the Net Profits Interest. The cash held by the Trustee as a reserve against future liabilities or for distribution at the next distribution date must be invested in: 
 

 | interest bearing obligations of the United States government;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


 | money market funds that invest only in United States government securities;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
2 


 
 | repurchase agreements secured by interest-bearing obligations of the United States government;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | bank certificates of deposit;
--+------------------------------


 | other interest bearing accounts in FDIC-insured or national banks, including the Trustee, so long as the entire amount in such accounts is at all times fully insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the SEI SDIT Treasury II Fund, the Goldman Sachs Financial SquareSM Funds, and other similar funds commonly used by trust departments.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Alternatively, cash held for distribution at the next distribution date may be held in an FDIC-insured or national bank, including the Trustee, if the interest paid to the Trust at least equals amounts paid by the Trustee on similar deposits, and the Trustee may make other short-term investments with the funds distributed to the Trust. The Trust may not acquire any asset except the Net Profits Interest, cash and temporary cash investments, and it may not engage in any investment activity except investing cash on hand. 
 The Trust is not subject to any pre-set termination provisions based on a maximum volume of oil or natural gas to be produced or the passage of time. The Trust will dissolve upon the earliest to occur of the following: 
 

 | the Trust, upon the approval of the holders of at least 75% of the outstanding Trust units, sells the Net Profits Interest;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the annual cash proceeds available for distribution to the Trust is less than $2.0 million for each of any two consecutive years;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the holders of at least 75% of the outstanding Trust units vote in favor of dissolution; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the Trust is judicially dissolved.
--+-----------------------------------

 Upon dissolution of the Trust, the Trustee would sell all of the Trusts assets, either by private sale or public auction, and, after payment or the making of reasonable provision for payment of all liabilities of the Trust, distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the Trust unitholders. 
 Marketing and Post-Production Services 
 Pursuant to the terms of the Conveyance creating the Net Profits Interest, Boaz Energy has the responsibility to market, or cause to be marketed, the oil and natural gas production attributable to the Net Profits Interest in the Underlying Properties. The terms of the Conveyance restrict Boaz Energy from charging any fee for marketing production attributable to the Net Profits Interest other than fees for marketing paid to non-affiliates. Accordingly, a marketing fee will not be deducted (other than fees paid to non-affiliates) in the calculation of the Net Profits Interests share of net profits. The net profits from the sales of oil and natural gas production from the Underlying Properties attributable to the Net Profits Interest are determined based on the same price that Boaz Energy receives for sales of oil and natural gas production attributable to Boaz Energys interest in the Underlying Properties. However, in the event that the oil or natural gas is processed, the net profits will receive the same processing upgrade or downgrade as Boaz Energy. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2018, Boaz Energy and other third-party operators of the Underlying Properties sold the oil produced from the Underlying Properties to third-party purchasers. Oil production from the Underlying Properties is typically transported by pipeline or truck from the field to the closest gathering facility or refinery. Boaz Energy and other operators sell the majority of the oil production from the Underlying Properties under contracts based on geographic location using market sensitive pricing. The price received by the operators for the oil production from the Underlying Properties is usually based on a regional price applied to equal daily quantities in the month of delivery that is then reduced for differentials based upon delivery location and oil quality. 
 
3 


 All natural gas produced from the Underlying Properties is marketed and sold to third-party purchasers. In all cases, the contract price is based on a percentage of a published regional index price, after adjustments for Btu content, transportation and related charges. Natural gas production is typically transported by pipeline to the closest gathering facility. Natural gas that is processed to remove NGLs is done under a percentage of proceeds contract and the Trusts percentage of those proceeds are included in the Net Profits Interest. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2018, Boaz Energy reported that Phillips 66, Plains All American Pipeline and Sunoco, Inc. accounted for 27.45%, 29.01%, and 16.32%, respectively, of its total oil and natural gas revenues, and that no other purchaser accounted for 10% or more of the total revenue of the Underlying Properties. Boaz Energy does not believe that the loss of any of these parties as a purchaser of crude oil or natural gas production from the Underlying Properties would have a material impact on the business or operations of Boaz Energy or the Underlying Properties because of the large number of marketing firms and competitive nature of oil and gas purchasers in the Permian Basin. 
 Competition and Markets 
 The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. Boaz Energy competes with major oil and natural gas companies and independent oil and natural gas companies for oil and natural gas, equipment, personnel and markets for the sale of oil and natural gas. Many of these competitors are financially stronger than Boaz Energy, but even financially troubled competitors can affect the market because of their need to sell oil and natural gas at any price to attempt to maintain cash flow. Because Boaz Energy and the third party operators of the Underlying Properties are subject to competitive conditions in the oil and natural gas industry, the Trusts Net Profits Interest is indirectly subject to those same competitive conditions. 
 Oil and natural gas compete with other forms of energy available to customers, primarily based on price. These alternate forms of energy include electricity, coal and fuel oils. Changes in the availability or price of oil, natural gas or other forms of energy, as well as business conditions, conservation, legislation, regulations and the ability to convert to alternate fuels and other forms of energy may affect the demand for oil and natural gas. 
 Future prices for oil and natural gas will directly impact Trust distributions, estimates of reserves attributable to the Trusts interests and estimated and actual future net revenues to the Trust. In view of the many uncertainties that affect the supply and demand for oil and natural gas, neither the Trust nor Boaz Energy can make reliable predictions of future oil and natural gas supply and demand or future product prices. Nevertheless, lower product prices generally will result in lower distributions, lower estimates of reserves attributable to the Trusts interests and lower estimated and actual future net revenues to the Trust. 
 All of the Trusts assets are located in the United States. Boaz Energy and the third-party operators of the Underlying Properties sell the oil and natural gas produced from the Underlying Properties to third-party purchasers in the United States. Demand for natural gas generally is higher in the winter months, but otherwise seasonal factors do not affect the Trust. 
 Description of Trust Units 
 Each Trust unit is a unit of beneficial interest in the Trust assets and is entitled to receive cash distributions from the Trust on a pro rata basis. Each Trust unitholder has the same rights regarding each of his Trust units as every other Trust unitholder has regarding his units. The Trust units are in book-entry form only and are not represented by certificates. The Trust had 12,165,732 Trust units outstanding as of April 1, 2019. 
Distributions and Income Computations 
 Each month, the Trustee determines the amount of funds available for distribution to the Trust unitholders. Available funds are the cash, if any, received by the Trust from the Net Profits Interest and other sources (such as 
 
4 


  interest earned on any amounts reserved by the Trustee) that month, over the Trusts liabilities for that month. Available funds will be reduced by any cash the Trustee decides to hold as a reserve against future liabilities. The holders of Trust units as of the applicable record date are entitled to monthly distributions payable on or before the 10th business day after the record date. 
 Unless otherwise advised by counsel or the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS), the Trustee will treat the income and expenses of the Trust for each month as belonging to the Trust unitholders of record on the monthly record date. Trust unitholders generally will recognize income and expenses for tax purposes in the month the Trust receives or pays those amounts, rather than in the month the Trust distributes the cash to which such income or expenses (as applicable) relate. Minor variances may occur. For example, the Trustee could establish a reserve in one month that would not result in a tax deduction until a later month. 
 Transfer of Trust Units 
 Trust unitholders may transfer their Trust units in accordance with the Trust Agreement. The Trustee will not require either the transferor or transferee to pay a service charge for any transfer of a Trust unit. The Trustee may require payment of any tax or other governmental charge imposed for a transfer. The Trustee may treat the owner of any Trust unit as shown by its records as the owner of the Trust unit. The Trustee will not be considered to know about any claim or demand on a Trust unit by any party except the record owner. A person who acquires a Trust unit after any monthly record date will not be entitled to the distribution relating to that monthly record date. 
Periodic Reports 
 The Trustee files all required Trust federal and state income tax and information returns. The Trustee prepares and mails or otherwise makes available to Trust unitholders annual reports that Trust unitholders need to correctly report their share of the income and deductions of the Trust. The Trustee also causes to be prepared and filed reports required to be filed under the Exchange Act and by the rules of any securities exchange or quotation system on which the Trust units are listed or admitted to trading, and will also cause the Trust to comply with all of the provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley, including but not limited to, establishing, evaluating and maintaining a system of internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 thereof. 
 Each Trust unitholder and his representatives may examine, for any proper purpose, during reasonable business hours, the records of the Trust and the Trustee, subject to such restrictions as are set forth in the Trust Agreement. 
 Liability of Trust Unitholders 
 Under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, Trust unitholders are entitled to the same limitation of personal liability extended to stockholders of private corporations for profit under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. No assurance can be given, however, that the courts in jurisdictions outside of Delaware will give effect to such limitation. 
Voting Rights of Trust Unitholders 
 The Trustee or Trust unitholders owning at least 10% of the outstanding Trust units may call meetings of Trust unitholders. The Trust is responsible for all costs associated with calling a meeting of Trust unitholders unless (i) such meeting is called by the Trust unitholders, in which case the Trust unitholders will be responsible for all costs associated with calling such meeting of Trust unitholders or (ii) such meeting is called for the purpose of approving the sale or release of the Net Profits Interest at Boaz Energys request, in which case the Trust will be responsible for 80% of all costs associated with calling such meeting of Trust unitholders and Boaz Energy will be responsible for 20% of such costs. Meetings must be held in such location as is designated by the 
 
5 


  Trustee in the notice of such meeting. The Trustee must send notice of the time and place of the meeting and the matters to be acted upon to all of the Trust unitholders at least 20 days and not more than 60 days before the meeting. Trust unitholders representing a majority of Trust units outstanding must be present or represented to have a quorum. Each Trust unitholder is entitled to one vote for each Trust unit owned. Abstentions and broker non-votes shall not be deemed to be a vote cast. 
 Unless otherwise required by the Trust Agreement, a matter may be approved or disapproved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Trust units present in person or by proxy at a meeting where there is a quorum. This is true, even if a majority of the total Trust units did not approve it. The affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of the outstanding Trust units is required to: 
 

 | dissolve the Trust; or
--+-----------------------


 | amend the Trust Agreement (except with respect to certain matters that do not adversely affect the rights of Trust unitholders in any material respect).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Boaz Energy may cause the Trustee to (i) sell all or any part of the Trust estate, including all or any portion of the Net Profits Interest or (ii) release any portion of the Net Profits Interest in connection with the sale, free from and unburdened by the Net Profits Interest, by Boaz Energy and/or its affiliates of a divided or undivided portion of their interests in the Underlying Properties, if approved by Trust unitholders holding at least 75% of the outstanding Trust units, provided that, after December 31, 2022, such a sale or release shall require approval of a majority of the outstanding Trust units if Boaz Energy and its affiliates own less than 25% of the outstanding Trust units. The net proceeds of any such sale or the consideration received in respect of such release, as applicable, shall be distributed to the Trust unitholders in the manner approved by the Trust unitholders at such meeting. 
 In addition, Boaz Energy may, without the consent of the Trust unitholders, require the Trust to release the Net Profits Interest associated with any interest in the Underlying Properties that accounted for no more than 1.0% of the total production from the Underlying Properties in the prior 12 months, provided that Boaz Energy may not require the release during any 365-day period of portions of the Net Profits Interest having an aggregate fair value to the Trust of greater than $500,000. 
 Computation of Net Profits 
 Net Profits Interest 
 The provisions of the Conveyance governing the computation of the net profits are detailed and extensive. The following information summarizes the material provisions of the Conveyance related to the computation of the net profits, but is qualified in its entirety by the text of the Conveyance, which is incorporated by reference as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 As set forth in the Conveyance, net profits are computed monthly, and (i) 80% of the aggregate net profits attributable to the sale of oil and natural gas production from the Underlying Properties and (ii) all amounts received pursuant to the derivative put option contracts (net of any costs associated therewith), received during each calendar month are paid to the Trust on or before the end of the following month. Boaz Energy does not pay to the Trust any interest on the net profits held by Boaz Energy prior to payment to the Trust, provided that such payments are timely made. 
 Gross profits means the aggregate amount received by Boaz Energy from and after January 1, 2018 from sales of oil and natural gas produced from the Underlying Properties that are attributable to a production month that occurs on or after January 1, 2018 (after deducting the appropriate share of all royalties and any overriding royalties, production payments and other similar charges (in each case, in existence as of January 1, 2018) and

6 


  other than certain excluded proceeds, as described in the Conveyance), including all proceeds and consideration received (i) directly or indirectly, for advance payments, (ii) directly or indirectly, under take-or-pay and similar provisions of production sales contracts (when credited against the price for delivery of production) and (iii) under balancing arrangements. Gross profits do not include consideration for the transfer or sale of any Underlying Property by Boaz Energy or any subsequent owner to any new owner, unless the Net Profits Interest is released (as is permitted under certain circumstances). Gross profits also do not include any amount for oil or natural gas lost in production or marketing or used by the owner of the Underlying Properties in drilling, production and plant operations.
Net profits means, as more fully set forth in the Conveyance, gross profits less the following costs, expenses and, where applicable, losses, liabilities and damages in each case as incurred by Boaz Energy and attributable to the Underlying Properties on or after January 1, 2018 but that are not attributable to a production month that occurs prior to January 1, 2018 (as such items are reduced by any offset amounts, as described in the Conveyance):


 | all costs and expenses from and after April 1, 2018 for drilling and development activities on the Underlying Properties, including (i) all direct labor and other services necessary for drilling and developing the Underlying Properties, (ii) all materials purchased for use in, or in connection with, the drilling and development of the Underlying Properties, and (iii) any other operations with respect to the exploration or development of hydrocarbons from the Underlying Properties;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | all costs and expenses associated with production, operation, maintenance and abandonment operations associated with the Underlying Properties, including (i) all direct labor and other services necessary for operating, producing and maintaining the Underlying Properties, (ii) treatment, dehydration, compression, separation and transportation, (iii) all materials purchased for use on, or in connection with operating, producing or maintaining, any of the Underlying Properties and (iv) any other operations with respect to the operation of hydrocarbons from the Underlying Properties;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | all losses, costs, expenses, liabilities and damages with respect to the operation or maintenance of the Underlying Properties for (i) defending, prosecuting, handling, investigating or settling litigation, administrative proceedings, claims, damages, judgments, fines, penalties and other liabilities, (ii) the payment of certain judgments, penalties and other liabilities, (iii) the payment or restitution of any proceeds of hydrocarbons from the Underlying Properties, (iv) complying with applicable local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations, (v) tax or royalty audits and (vi) any other loss, cost, expense, liability or damage with respect to the Underlying Properties not paid or reimbursed under insurance;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | all taxes, charges and assessments (excluding federal and state income, transfer, mortgage, inheritance, estate, franchise and like taxes) with respect to the ownership of, or production of hydrocarbons from, the Underlying Properties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | all insurance premiums attributable to the ownership or operation of the Underlying Properties for insurance actually carried with respect to the Underlying Properties, or any equipment located on any of the Underlying Properties, or incident to the operation or maintenance of the Underlying Properties;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | all amounts and other consideration for (i) rent and the use of or damage to the surface, (ii) delay rentals, shut-in well payments and similar payments and (iii) fees for renewal, extension, modification, amendment, replacement or supplementation of the leases included in the Underlying Properties;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | to the extent that Boaz Energy is not the operator of an Underlying Property, all amounts charged by the relevant operator as overhead, administrative or indirect charges specified in the applicable operating agreements or other arrangements covering such Underlying Property plus $50 per well located on such property in respect of overhead, administrative and indirect charges incurred by Boaz Energy;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
7 


 
 | to the extent that Boaz Energy is the operator of an Underlying Property, $350 per well located on such property in respect of Boaz Energys overhead, administrative and indirect charges associated with such Underlying Property;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | if, as a result of the occurrence of the bankruptcy or insolvency or similar occurrence of any purchaser of hydrocarbons produced from the Underlying Properties, any amounts previously credited to the determination of the net profits are reclaimed from Boaz Energy, then the amounts reclaimed;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | all costs and expenses for recording the Conveyance and, at the applicable times, terminations and/or releases thereof;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | amounts previously included in gross profits but subsequently paid as a refund, interest or penalty; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | at the option of Boaz Energy (or any subsequent owner of the Underlying Properties), amounts reserved for ad valorem taxes, property taxes and future development expenses, including well drilling, recompletion and workover costs, which amounts will at no time exceed $3.0 million in the aggregate, and will be subject to the limitations described below (provided that such costs shall not be debited from gross profits when actually incurred).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The per well overhead charges described in the seventh and eighth bullet point paragraphs above will be adjusted at the beginning of each year based on the adjustment procedures contained in the 2005 version of the accounting procedures published by the Council of Petroleum Accountants Societies, Inc., which is attached to the Conveyance. 
 As described above, the costs deducted in the net profits determination are reduced by certain offset amounts. The offset amounts are further described in the Conveyance, and include, among other things, certain net proceeds attributable to the treatment or processing of hydrocarbons produced from the Underlying Properties and certain other non-production revenues, including salvage value for equipment related to plugged and abandoned wells. If the offset amounts exceed the costs during a monthly period, the ability to use such excess amounts to offset costs will be deferred and utilized as offsets in the next monthly period to the extent such amounts, plus accrued interest thereon, together with other offsets to costs, for the applicable month, are less than the costs arising in such month. 
 The Trust is not liable to the owners of the Underlying Properties or the operators for any operating, capital or other costs or liabilities attributable to the Underlying Properties. In the event that the net profits for any computation period is a negative amount, the Trust will receive no payment for that period, and any such negative amount plus accrued interest will be deducted from gross profits in the following computation period for purposes of determining the net profits for that following computation period. 
 Gross profits and net profits are calculated on a cash basis, except that certain costs, primarily ad valorem taxes and expenditures of a material amount, may be determined on an accrual basis. 
 Derivative Contracts 
 Boaz Energy entered into derivative put option contracts with respect to approximately 100% of expected oil production attributable to the Net Profits Interest, based on the reserve report, for the period from its initial public offering through December 31, 2018. Boaz Energy has entered into derivative put option contracts with respect to approximately 76% of such production during 2019. Boaz Energy believes that these put option contracts will provide downside protection to the Trust in the event spot prices for crude oil decline below the applicable strike price, while still allowing the Trust to benefit from increasing crude oil prices. Boaz Energy has not entered into any derivative contracts relating to oil and natural gas volumes expected to be produced after December 31, 2019, and the terms of the Conveyance prohibit Boaz Energy from entering into new hedging arrangements burdening the Trust. As a result, the amount of the cash distributions will be subject to a greater fluctuation after December 31, 2019 due to changes in oil and natural gas prices.

 Additional Provisions 
 If a controversy arises as to the sales price of any production, then for purposes of determining gross profits: 
 

 | any proceeds that are withheld for any reason (other than at the request of Boaz Energy) are not considered received until such time that the proceeds are actually collected;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | amounts received and promptly deposited with a nonaffiliated escrow agent will not be considered to have been received until disbursed to it by the escrow agent; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | amounts received and not deposited with an escrow agent will be considered to have been received.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Trustee is not obligated to return any cash received from the Net Profits Interest. Any overpayments made to the Trust by Boaz Energy due to adjustments to prior calculations of net profits or otherwise will reduce future amounts payable to the Trust until Boaz Energy recovers the overpayments plus interest at a prime rate (as described in the Conveyance). 
 The Conveyance generally permits Boaz Energy to transfer without the consent or approval of the Trust unitholders all or any part of its interest in the Underlying Properties, subject to the Net Profits Interest. The Trust unitholders are not entitled to any proceeds from a sale or transfer of Boaz Energys interest. Except in certain cases where the Net Profits Interest is released, following a sale or transfer, the Underlying Properties will continue to be subject to the Net Profits Interest, and the gross profits attributable to the transferred property will be calculated (as part of the computation of net profits described in this Annual Report), paid and distributed by the transferee to the Trust. Boaz Energy has no further obligations, requirements or responsibilities with respect to any such transferred interests. 
 In addition, Boaz Energy may, without the consent of the Trust unitholders, require the Trust to release the Net Profits Interest associated with any interest in the Underlying Properties that accounted for no more than 1.0% of the total production from the Underlying Properties in the prior 12 months, provided that Boaz Energy may not require the release during any 365-day period of portions of the Net Profits Interest having an aggregate fair value to the Trust of greater than $500,000. These releases will be made only in connection with a sale by Boaz Energy of the relevant Underlying Properties and the Trust will receive an amount equal to the fair value (net of sales costs) of the Net Profits Interest released. 
 The Trust announced on November 19, 2018 that Boaz Energy had sold and assigned its interest in certain leases located in Ward County, Texas as a result of a Qualified De Minimis Sale as contemplated by Section 3.02(c) of the Trust Agreement. Boaz Energy received $234,341 in consideration of the sale of its interest, which amount was included in the Trusts December 2018 distribution to unitholders. As of April 1, 2019, the Trustee has not been notified that Boaz Energy has identified for sale any other of the Underlying Properties. 
 In addition, Boaz Energy may cause the Trustee to (i) sell all or any part of the Trust estate, including all or any portion of the Net Profits Interest or (ii) release any portion of the Net Profits Interest in connection with the sale, free from and unburdened by the Net Profits Interest, by Boaz Energy and/or its affiliates of a divided or undivided portion of their interests in the Underlying Properties, if approved by Trust unitholders holding at least 75% of the outstanding Trust units, provided that, after December 31, 2022, such a sale or release shall require approval of a majority of the outstanding Trust units if Boaz Energy and its affiliates own less than 25% of the outstanding Trust units. The net proceeds of any such sale or the consideration received in respect of such release, as applicable, will be distributed to the Trust unitholders in the manner approved by the Trust unitholders at such meeting. 
 As the designated operator of a property comprising the Underlying Properties, Boaz Energy may enter into farm-out, operating, participation and other similar agreements to develop the property, but any transfers made in connection with such agreements will be made subject to the Net Profits Interest. Boaz Energy may enter into any of these agreements without the consent or approval of the Trustee or any Trust unitholder.

 Boaz Energy has the right to release, surrender or abandon its interest in any Underlying Property that will no longer produce (or be capable of producing) hydrocarbons in paying quantities (determined without regard to the Net Profits Interest). Upon such release, surrender or abandonment, the portion of the Net Profits Interest relating to the affected property will also be released, surrendered or abandoned, as applicable. Boaz Energy also has the right to abandon an interest in the Underlying Properties if (a) such abandonment is necessary for health, safety or environmental reasons or (b) the hydrocarbons that would have been produced from the abandoned portion of the Underlying Properties would reasonably be expected to be produced from wells located on the remaining portion of the Underlying Properties. 
 Boaz Energy must maintain books and records sufficient to determine the amounts payable for the Net Profits Interest to the Trust. Monthly and annually, Boaz Energy must deliver to the Trustee a statement of the computation of the net profits for each computation period. The annual computation shall be audited. The Trustee has the right to inspect, review and audit the books and records maintained by Boaz Energy during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice. 
 U.S. Federal Income Tax Matters 
 The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax matters that may be relevant to the Trust unitholders. This summary is based upon current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), existing and proposed regulations thereunder (the Treasury Regulations) and current administrative rulings and court decisions, all of which are subject to changes that may or may not be retroactively applied. No attempt has been made in the following summary to comment on all U.S. federal income tax matters affecting the Trust or the Trust unitholders. 
 The summary has limited application to non-U.S. persons and persons subject to special tax treatment such as, without limitation: banks, insurance companies or other financial institutions; Trust unitholders subject to the alternative minimum tax; tax-exempt organizations; dealers in securities or commodities; regulated investment companies; real estate investment trusts; traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities holdings; non-U.S. Trust unitholders that are controlled foreign corporations or passive foreign investment companies; persons that are S-corporations, partnerships or other pass-through entities; persons that own their interest in the Trust units through S-corporations, partnerships or other pass-through entities; persons that at any time own more than 5% of the aggregate fair market value of the Trust units; expatriates and certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States; U.S. Trust unitholders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; persons who hold the Trust units as a position in a hedging transaction, straddle, conversion transaction or other risk reduction transaction; or persons deemed to sell the Trust units under the constructive sale provisions of the Code. Each Trust unitholder should consult his own tax advisor with respect to his particular circumstances. 
 Classification and Taxation of the Trust 
 Tax counsel to the Trust advised the Trust at the time of formation that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in its opinion, the Trust will be treated as a grantor trust and not as an unincorporated business entity. No ruling has been or will be requested from the IRS with respect to the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Trust, including as to the status of the Trust as a grantor trust. Thus, no assurance can be provided that the tax treatment of the Trust would be sustained by a court if contested by the IRS or another taxing authority. The remainder of the discussion below is based on tax counsels opinion that the Trust will be classified as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 As a grantor trust, the Trust is not subject to U.S. federal income tax at the trust level. Rather, each Trust unitholder is considered for U.S. federal income tax purposes, to own its proportionate share of the Trusts assets directly as though the Trust were not in existence. The income of the Trust is deemed to be received or accrued 
 
10 


  by each Trust unitholder at the time such income is received or accrued by the Trust, rather than when distributed by the Trust. Each Trust unitholder is subject to tax on its proportionate share of the income and gain attributable to the assets of the Trust and is entitled to claim its proportionate share of the deductions and expenses attributable to the assets of the Trust, subject to applicable limitations, in accordance with the Trust unitholders tax method of accounting and taxable year without regard to the taxable year or accounting method employed by the Trust. Trust unitholders should be entitled to deductions for the greater of either cost depletion or (if allowable) percentage depletion with respect to income from the Net Profits Interest. 
 The Trust files annual information returns, reporting to the Trust unitholders all items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit. The Trust allocates these items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit to Trust unitholders based on record ownership on each monthly record date. It is possible that the IRS or another taxing authority could disagree with this allocation method and assert that income and deductions of the Trust should be determined and allocated on a daily or prorated basis, which could require adjustments to the tax returns of the affected Trust unitholders and result in an increase in the administrative expense of the Trust in subsequent periods. 
 Under current law, the highest marginal U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to ordinary income of individuals is 37%, and the highest marginal U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to long-term capital gains (generally, gains from the sale or exchange of certain investment assets held for more than one year) is 20%. The highest marginal U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to corporations is 21%, and such rate applies to both ordinary income and capital gains. 
 In addition, a 3.8% Medicare contribution tax is imposed on certain investment income earned by individuals, estates, and trusts. For these purposes, investment income generally will include a Trust unitholders allocable share of the income from the Net Profits Interest plus the gain recognized from a sale of Trust units. In the case of an individual, the tax is imposed on the lesser of (i) the individuals net investment income from all investments, or (ii) the amount by which the individuals modified adjusted gross income exceeds specified threshold levels depending on such individuals U.S. federal income tax filing status. In the case of an estate or trust, the tax is imposed on the lesser of (i) undistributed net investment income, or (ii) the excess adjusted gross income over the dollar amount at which the highest income tax bracket applicable to an estate or trust begins. 
 Upon the sale or other taxable disposition of Trust units, a Trust unitholder will be treated as having sold his share of the Net Profits Interest and must treat as ordinary income the depletion recapture amount, which is an amount equal to the lesser of the gain on such sale or other taxable disposition or the sum of the prior depletion deductions taken with respect to the Trust units, but not in excess of the initial tax basis of the Trust units. 
Classification of the Net Profits Interest 
 Tax counsel to the Trust advised the Trust at the time of formation that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, based on the reserve report and representations made by Boaz Energy regarding the expected economic life of the Underlying Properties and the expected duration of the Net Profits Interest, the Net Profits Interest will be treated as a continuing, non-operating economic interest in the nature of a royalty payable out of production from the mineral interests it burdens. 
 No assurance can be given that the IRS or another taxing authority will not assert that the Net Profits Interest should be treated differently. Any such different treatment could affect the amount, timing and character of income, gain or loss in respect of an investment in Trust units. 
 Reporting Requirements for Widely Held Fixed Investment Trusts 
 The Trustee assumes that some Trust units are held by middlemen, as such term is broadly defined in the Treasury Regulations (and includes custodians, nominees, certain joint owners and brokers holding an interest for 
 
11 


  a custodian in street name, collectively referred to herein as middlemen). Therefore, the Trustee considers the Trust to be a non-mortgage widely held fixed investment trust (WHFIT) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Simmons Bank, EIN 71-0162300, P.O. Box 470727 Fort Worth, Texas 76147, telephone number (855) 588-7839, is the representative of the Trust that will provide the tax information in accordance with applicable Treasury Regulations governing the information reporting requirements of the Trust as a WHFIT. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the middlemen holding Trust units on behalf of Trust unitholders, and not the Trustee of the Trust, are solely responsible for complying with the information reporting requirements under the Treasury Regulations with respect to such Trust units, including the issuance of IRS Forms 1099 and certain written tax statements. Unitholders whose Trust units are held by middlemen should consult with such middlemen regarding the information that will be reported to them by the middlemen with respect to the Trust units. Any generic tax information provided by the Trustee of the Trust is intended to be used only to assist Trust unitholders in the preparation of their U.S. federal and state income tax returns. 
 Available Trust Tax Information 
 In compliance with the Treasury Regulations reporting requirements for WHFITs and the dissemination of Trust tax reporting information, the Trustee provides a generic tax information reporting booklet which is intended to be used only to assist Trust unitholders in the preparation of their federal and state income tax returns. This tax information booklet can be obtained at www.permrock.com. 
Regulation of Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Matters 
 Oil, natural gas and NGL exploration, development and production operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment or occupational health and safety. These laws and regulations have the potential to impact production and development operations on the Underlying Properties, including requirements to: 

 | obtain permits to conduct regulated activities;
--+------------------------------------------------


 | limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | restrict the types, quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment in the performance of drilling and production activities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | initiate investigatory and remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former or current operations, such as restoration of drilling pits and plugging of abandoned wells; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | apply specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal sanctions, including monetary penalties, the imposition of strict, joint and several liability, investigatory and remedial obligations and the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of the operations on the Underlying Properties. Moreover, these laws, rules and regulations may restrict the rate of oil, natural gas and NGL production below the rate that would otherwise be possible. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability. The trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, and thus, any changes in environmental laws and regulations or re-interpretation of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly construction, drilling, water management, completion, emission or discharge limits or waste handling, disposal or remediation obligations could increase the cost to Boaz Energy of developing the Underlying Properties. Moreover, accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of operations on the Underlying Properties, causing Boaz Energy to incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third-party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons. 
 
12 


 Increased costs or operating restrictions on the Underlying Properties as a result of compliance with or liability under environmental laws could result in reduced exploratory and production activities on the Underlying Properties and, as a result, distributable cash to the Trust unitholders. The following is a summary of certain existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, each as amended from time to time, to which operations on the Underlying Properties are subject. 
 Hazardous Substances and Waste Handling 
 The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. Under CERCLA, these responsible persons may include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and entities that transport, dispose of or arrange for the transport or disposal of hazardous substances released at the site. These responsible persons may be subject to joint and several strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third-parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. 
 The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and comparable state laws control the management and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste. These laws and regulations govern the generation, storage, treatment, transfer and disposal of wastes generated. Drilling fluids, produced waters and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil, natural gas and NGLs, if properly handled, are currently exempt from regulation as hazardous waste under RCRA and, instead, are regulated under RCRAs less stringent non-hazardous waste provisions, state laws or other federal laws. However, it is possible that certain oil, natural gas and NGL drilling and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. For example, in December 2016, the EPA and environmental groups entered into a consent decree to address the EPAs alleged failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations exempting certain exploration and production related oil, natural gas and NGL wastes from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA. The consent decree requires the EPA to propose a rulemaking no later than March 15, 2019 for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil, natural gas and NGL wastes or to sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. If the EPA proposes rulemaking for revised oil and natural gas regulations, the consent decree requires that the EPA take final action following notice and comment rulemaking no later than July 15, 2021. Any such change could result in an increase in the costs to manage and dispose of wastes, which could increase the costs of Boaz Energys operations. 
 Certain of the Underlying Properties have been used for oil and natural gas exploration and production for many years. Although the operators may have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the Underlying Properties, or on or under other offsite locations where these petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes have been taken for recycling or disposal. The Underlying Properties and the petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes disposed or released thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, the owner or operator could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes, to clean up contaminated property and to perform remedial operations such as restoration of pits and plugging of abandoned wells to prevent future contamination or to pay some or all of the costs of any such action. 
 Water Discharges 
 The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil, 
 
13 


  into federal and state waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. Obtaining permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. In addition, federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations. In June 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps) published a final rule attempting to clarify the federal jurisdictional reach over waters of the United States (WOTUS). Several legal challenges to the rule followed, along with attempts to stay implementation following the change in presidential administration. Currently, the WOTUS rule is active in some states and enjoined in others. However, on December 11, 2018, the EPA and the Corps proposed changes to regulations under the CWA that would provide discrete categories of jurisdictional waters and tests for determining whether a particular waterbody meets any of those classifications. Several groups have already announced their intentions to challenge the proposed rule. Therefore, the scope of jurisdiction under the CWA is uncertain at this time. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure plan requirements imposed under the Clean Water Act require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended, or OPA, amends the Clean Water Act and establishes strict liability and natural resource damages liability for unauthorized discharges of oil into waters of the United States. OPA requires owners or operators of certain onshore facilities to prepare Facility Response Plans for responding to a worst case discharge of oil into waters of the United States. 
 Air Emissions 
 The CAA and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources through air emissions permitting programs and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. These laws and regulations may require Boaz Energy to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or incur development expenses to install and utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. For example, in June 2016 the EPA finalized rules regarding criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air-quality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and gas industry. This rule could cause small facilities, on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major source, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting processes and requirements. Any such requirements could increase the costs of development and production on the Underlying Properties, potentially impairing the economic development of the Underlying Properties and reducing the amount of cash distributable to Trust unitholders. Obtaining permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. Federal and state regulatory agencies may impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the CAA and associated state laws and regulations. 
Climate Change 
 In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the CAA that, among other things, establish PSD, construction and Title V operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources. 
 At the federal level, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented to date. The EPA has, however, adopted rules under authority of the CAA that, among other things, establish Potential for Significant Deterioration (PSD) construction and Title V operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that are also potential major sources of certain principal, or criteria, pollutant emissions. Under these regulations, facilities required to obtain PSD permits must meet best available control technology standards for those GHG emissions. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring 
 
14 


  and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources in the U.S., including, among others, onshore and offshore production facilities, which include certain operations on the Underlying Properties. The EPA has expanded the GHG reporting requirements to all segments of the oil and natural gas industry, including gathering and boosting facilities as well as completions and workovers from hydraulically fractured oil wells. 
 Federal agencies also have begun directly regulating emissions of methane from oil and natural gas operations. For example, in June 2016, the EPA published New Source Performance Standards (NSPS), known as Subpart OOOOa, that requires certain new, modified or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector to reduce these methane gas and volatile organic compound emissions. Following the change in presidential administration, there have been attempts to modify these regulations, and litigation concerning the regulations is ongoing. As a result, we cannot predict the scope of any final methane regulatory requirements or the cost to comply with such requirements. 
 At the international level, in December 2015, the United States and 194 other participating countries adopted the Paris Agreement, which calls for each participating country to establish their own nationally determined standards for reducing carbon output. However, in August 2017 the United States notified the United Nations that it would be withdrawing from the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement provides for a four-year exit process beginning when it took effect in November 2016, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020. The United States adherence to the exit process and/or the terms on which the United States may reenter the Paris Agreement or separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time. Various state and local governments have publicly committed to furthering the goals of the Paris Agreement. 
 The adoption and implementation of any international, federal or state legislation or regulations that require reporting of GHGs or otherwise restrict emissions of GHGs could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions for Boaz Energy, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Notwithstanding potential risks related to climate change, the International Energy Agency estimates that oil and gas will continue to represent a major share of global energy use through 2040, and other private sector studies project continued growth in demand for the next two decades. However, recent activism directed at shifting funding away from companies with energy-related assets could result in limitations or restrictions on certain sources of funding for the energy sector. Moreover, activist shareholders have introduced proposals that may seek to force companies to adopt aggressive emission reduction targets or to shift away from more carbon-intensive activities. While we cannot predict the outcomes of such proposals, they could make it more difficult for Boaz Energy to engage in exploration and production activities, ultimately reducing distributable cash to Trust unitholders. Finally, many scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHG in the atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climate events that could have an adverse effect on operations of the Underlying Properties and, as a result, the amount of cash distributable to Trust unitholders. 
 Hydraulic Fracturing Activities 
 Boaz Energy engages in hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is a common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations, including shales. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Currently, hydraulic fracturing is generally exempt from regulation under the U.S. Safe Drinking Water Acts Underground Injection Control program and is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions or similar agencies. 
 However, several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, in June 2016, the EPA published an effluent limit guideline final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment 
 
15 


  plants. Additionally, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The final report concluded that water cycle activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain limited circumstances. From time to time, legislation has been introduced, but not enacted, in Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. In the event that new federal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we own mineral or royalty interests, Boaz Energy may incur additional costs or permitting requirements to comply with such federal requirements that may be significant and that could result in added delays or curtailment in Boaz Energys pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, which would in turn reduce the oil, natural gas and NGLs produced from the Underlying Properties. 
 Moreover, some states and local governments have adopted, and other governmental entities are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well-construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations, including states in which the Underlying Properties are located. For example, Texas has adopted regulations that impose new or more stringent permitting, disclosure, disposal and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. States could also elect to prohibit high volume hydraulic fracturing altogether. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular. 
 Increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to, and litigation concerning, oil, natural gas and NGL production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs for Boaz Energy in the production of oil, natural gas and NGLs, including from the developing shale plays, or could make it more difficult for Boaz Energy to perform hydraulic fracturing. The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in Boaz Energys completion of new oil and natural gas wells on the Underlying Properties and an associated decrease in the distributable cash in the Trust. 
 Endangered Species Act and Migratory Birds Treaty Act 
 In the United States, the Endangered Species Act (the ESA) restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (the MBTA). To the extent species that are listed under the ESA or similar state laws, or are protected under the MBTA, live in the areas where the Underlying Properties are located, Boaz Energys abilities to conduct or expand operations on the Underlying Properties could be limited, or Boaz Energy could be forced to incur material additional costs. Moreover, Boaz Energys drilling activities may be delayed, restricted or precluded in protected habitat areas or during certain seasons, such as breeding and nesting seasons. 
 In addition, as a result of one or more settlements approved by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (the FWS), the agency is required to make a determination on the listing of numerous other species as endangered or threatened under the ESA by the end of the FWS 2017 fiscal year. The agency missed the deadline, and the review is reportedly ongoing. The designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause Boaz Energys operations to become subject to operating restrictions or bans, and limit future development activity in affected areas. For example, recently, there have been renewed calls to review protections currently in place for the Dunes Sagebrush Lizard, whose habitat includes portions of the Permian Basin, and to reconsider listing the species under the ESA. If the Dunes Sagebrush Lizard or other species are listed, the FWS and similar state agencies may designate critical or suitable habitat areas that they believe are necessary for the survival of threatened or endangered species. Such a designation could materially restrict use of or access to federal, state and private lands. To the extent species are listed under the ESA or similar state laws, or previously unprotected species are designated as threatened or endangered in areas where the Underlying Properties are located, operations on the Underlying Properties could incur increased costs arising from species protection measures and face delays or limitations with respect to production activities thereon.

 Employee Health and Safety 
 Operations on the Underlying Properties are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA, and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens.
