Background
We are a leader in designing, developing, manufacturing, and marketing proprietary engineered industrial products. We serve a wide variety of customers in varied industries around the world. As of December 31, 2018, we had 50 primary manufacturing facilities located in 12 countries, including the United States. We were incorporated under the laws of the State of North Carolina on January 11, 2002, as a wholly owned subsidiary of Goodrich Corporation (“Goodrich”). The incorporation was in anticipation of Goodrich’s announced distribution of its Engineered Industrial Products segment to existing Goodrich shareholders. The distribution took place on May 31, 2002.
Our sales by geographic region in 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:

 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
 | (in millions)
United States | $ | 955.5 | | | $ | 750.6 | | $ | 682.4 
Europe | 292.9 | | | 292.6 | | | 289.9
Other | 283.6 | | | 266.4 | | | 215.4
Total | $ | 1,532.0 | | | $ | 1,309.6 | | $ | 1,187.7

On June 5, 2010 (the “GST Petition Date”), three of our subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of North Carolina (the "Bankruptcy Court") as a result of tens of thousands of pending and expected future asbestos personal injury claims. For a discussion of the effects of these proceedings on our financial statements, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Overview and Outlook – Overview” and Note 21, "Subsidiary Asbestos Bankruptcies" to our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this report. Because of the filing, the results of these subsidiaries were deconsolidated from our results from the GST Petition Date until the Joint Plan (as defined below) was consummated and became effective at 12:01 a.m. on July 31, 2017.
On March 17, 2016, we announced that we had reached a comprehensive consensual settlement to resolve current and future asbestos claims which contemplated the joint plan of reorganization (the "Joint Plan") which was filed with the Bankruptcy Court. This settlement contemplated that Coltec would, subject to the receipt of necessary consents, undergo a corporate restructuring (the “Coltec Restructuring”) in which all of its significant operating assets and subsidiaries, which included each of the Company’s major business units, would be distributed to a new direct subsidiary of the Company, which would also assume all of Coltec’s non-asbestos liabilities. The Coltec Restructuring was completed on December 31, 2016, and included the merger of Coltec with and into OldCo, LLC (“OldCo”), an indirect subsidiary of EnPro. As further contemplated by the settlement, on January 30, 2017 (the "OldCo Petition Date"), OldCo filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition with the Bankruptcy Court (the "OldCo Chapter 11 Case"). GST and OldCo were reconsolidated effective July 31, 2017, upon the consummation of the Joint Plan.
GST and OldCo had combined sales for the seven months ended July 30, 2017 (that is prior to the consummation of the Joint Plan) and for the year ended December 31, 2016 as follows:

 | Seven Months Ended July 30, 2017 | | Year Ended December 31, 2016
 | (in millions) 
United States | $ | 63.1 | | | $ | 101.6
Europe | 6.1 | | | 9.4 | 
Other | 56.7 | | | 84.8 | 
Total | $ | 125.9 | | | $ | 195.8

We market these products and services under the Fairbanks Morse® brand name. Products in this segment include licensed heavy-duty, medium-speed diesel, natural gas and dual fuel reciprocating engines, in addition to our own designs. The reciprocating engines range in size from 700 to 31,970 horsepower and from five to 20 cylinders. These products are used in marine, oil and gas, and power generation markets. We have been building engines for over 120 years under the Fairbanks Morse® brand name and we have a large installed base of engines for which we supply aftermarket parts and service. Fairbanks Morse has been a key supplier to the U.S. Navy for medium-speed diesel engines and has supplied engines to the U.S. Navy for over 75 years.
Customers. Our Power Systems segment sells its products and services to customers worldwide, including major shipyards, municipal utilities, institutional and industrial organizations, sewage treatment plants, nuclear power plants and offshore oil and gas platforms, with approximately 15% of sales delivered to customers outside the United States in 2018. We market our products through a direct sales force of engineers in North America and through independent agents worldwide. Our representative customers include Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Coast Guard, Electricite de France, Areva, Abbvie, and Exelon. In 2018, the largest customer accounted for approximately 14% of segment revenues.
Competition. Major competitors for our Power Systems segment include MTU, Caterpillar Inc., and Wartsila Corporation. Price, delivery time, engineering and service support, and engine efficiency relating to fuel consumption and emissions drive competition.
Raw Materials and Components. Our Power Systems segment purchases multiple ferrous and non-ferrous castings, forgings, plate stock and bar stock for fabrication and machining into engines. In addition, we buy a considerable amount of 
7

precision-machined engine components. We believe all of these raw materials and components are readily available from various suppliers, but may be subject to long and variable lead times.
Research and Development
The goal of our research and development effort is to strengthen our product portfolios for traditional markets while simultaneously creating distinctive and breakthrough products. We utilize a process to move product innovations from concept to commercialization, and to identify, analyze, develop and implement new product concepts and opportunities aimed at business growth.
We employ scientists, engineers and technicians throughout our operations to develop, design and test new and improved products. We work closely with our customers to identify issues and develop technical solutions. The majority of our research and development spending typically is directed toward the development of new sealing products for the most demanding environments, the development of truck and trailer fleet information systems, the development of bearing products and materials with increased load carrying capability and superior friction and wear characteristics, and the development of more efficient power systems to meet current and future emissions requirements.
Backlog
At December 31, 2018, we had a backlog of orders valued at $380.9 million compared with $377.0 million at December 31, 2017. Approximately 24% of the backlog, primarily in our Power Systems segment, is expected to be filled beyond 2019. Backlog represents orders on hand we believe to be firm. However, there is no certainty the backlog orders will result in actual sales at the times or in the amounts ordered. In addition, for most of our business, backlog is not particularly predictive of future performance because of our short lead times and some seasonality.
Quality Assurance
We believe product quality is among the most important factors in developing and maintaining strong, long-term relationships with our customers. In order to meet the exacting requirements of our customers, we maintain stringent standards of quality control. We routinely employ in-process inspection by using testing equipment as a process aid during all stages of development, design and production to ensure product quality and reliability. These include state-of-the-art CAD/CAM equipment, statistical process control systems, laser tracking devices, failure mode and effect analysis, and coordinate measuring machines. We are able to extract numerical quality control data as a statistical measurement of the quality of the parts being manufactured from our CNC machinery. In addition, we perform quality control tests on parts that we outsource. As a result, we are able to significantly reduce the number of defective parts and therefore improve efficiency, quality and reliability.
As of December 31, 2018, 46 of our manufacturing facilities were ISO 9000, QS 9000 and/or TS 16949 certified. Eighteen of our facilities are ISO 14001 certified. OEMs are increasingly requiring these standards in lieu of individual certification procedures and as a condition of awarding business.
Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
We maintain a number of patents and trademarks issued by the U.S. and other countries relating to the name and design of our products and have granted licenses to some of these patents and trademarks. We routinely evaluate the need to protect new and existing products through the patent and trademark systems in the U.S. and other countries. We also have unpatented proprietary information, consisting of know-how and trade secrets relating to the design, manufacture and operation of our products and their use. We do not consider our business as a whole to be materially dependent on any particular patent, patent right, trademark, trade secret or license granted or group of related patents, patent rights, trademarks, trade secrets or licenses granted.
In general, we are the owner of the rights to the products that we manufacture and sell. However, we also license patented and other proprietary technology and processes from various companies and individuals in order to broaden our product offerings. We are dependent on the ability of these third parties to diligently protect their intellectual property rights. In several cases, the intellectual property licenses are integral to the manufacture of our products and certain services we perform. A failure on the part of the licensor to protect its own intellectual property could reduce our revenues. These licenses are subject to renewal and it is possible we may not successfully renegotiate these licenses or they could be terminated in the event of a material breach. If this were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.  For example, Fairbanks Morse licenses technology from MAN Energy Solutions SE and its subsidiaries for a majority of the four-stroke reciprocating engines and spare parts it produces and for nearly all the new engines and parts it manufactures for use by the U.S military. The terms of the licenses vary by engine type. These licenses have been conditionally 
8

renewed for a ten-year term ending in 2029. The loss of these licenses could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Employees and Labor Relations
We currently have approximately 5,900 employees worldwide in our consolidated operations. Approximately 3,200 employees are located within the U.S., and approximately 2,700 employees are located outside the U.S., primarily in Europe, Mexico, Canada and China. Approximately 24% of our U.S. employees are members of trade unions covered by four collective bargaining agreements with contract expiration dates from August 2020 to November 2021. Union agreements relate, among other things, to wages, hours, and conditions of employment. The wages and benefits furnished are generally comparable to industry and area practices.
