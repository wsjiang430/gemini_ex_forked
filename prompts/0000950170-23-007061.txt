Item 1. Business
Overview
 Iridex Corporation is an ophthalmic medical technology company focused on the development and commercialization of breakthrough products and procedures used to treat sight-threatening eye conditions, including glaucoma and retinal diseases.
 Our propriety MicroPulse® Technology and Endpoint Management Technology are used for the treatment of glaucoma and retina disorders. Both technologies are offered as optional treatment modes in select laser consoles in addition to the standard continuous-wave (“CW”) treatment mode. They allow low-energy, subvisible, tissue-sparing laser therapy by different means: MicroPulse technology uses short, microsecond-long laser pulses that allow tissue to cool between pulses giving physicians finer control of thermal elevation to minimize tissue damage. Endpoint Management technology uses a delivery algorithm to titrate the laser energy. CW laser photocoagulation can stabilize vision over the long term but can also result in varying degrees of vision loss. Both MicroPulse and Endpoint Management technologies have demonstrated clinical efficacy with a safer profile compared to standard high-energy CW laser for the treatment of both retinal diseases and glaucoma.
 Our products consist of laser consoles, delivery devices and consumable probes.
 Our laser consoles consist of the following product lines:
 •Glaucoma – Our primary glaucoma console line is the Cyclo G6® laser system with MicroPulse technology. In addition, our medical retina consoles have features supporting glaucoma laser treatments.
 •Medical Retina – Our medical-retina product line includes our portable IQ 532® and IQ 577® laser systems with MicroPulse technology; and the Pattern Scanning Laser (“PASCAL”) System, an integrated workstation with Endpoint Management technology and MicroPulse technology. These systems are ideal for multispecialty practices because these lasers also can be used to treat glaucoma, i.e., single-spot laser trabeculoplasty using MicroPulse technology, iridotomy, and iridectomy using the IQ lasers; and pattern scanning laser trabeculoplasty (PSLT) using the PASCAL laser system.
 •Surgical Retina – Our surgical-retina product line includes our OcuLight® TX and OcuLight® SLx (with MicroPulse technology) laser photocoagulation systems. These systems are often used in vitrectomy procedures, which are used to treat proliferative diabetic retinopathy, macular holes, retinal tears and detachments.
 Our business generates recurring revenues through sales of consumable products, predominantly single-use laser probe devices and other instrumentation, as well as repair, service and extended service contracts for our laser systems.
 Our laser probes consist of the following product lines:
 •Glaucoma – Probes used in our glaucoma product line include our patented single-use delivery devices - MicroPulse P3®, G-Probe®, and G-Probe Illuminate®.
 •Surgical Retina – Probes used in our surgical retina product line include our family of single-use EndoProbe® handpieces.
 Ophthalmologists typically use our laser systems in hospital operating rooms and ambulatory surgical centers, as well as their offices and clinics. In operating rooms and ambulatory surgical centers, ophthalmologists use our laser systems with either an indirect laser ophthalmoscope or a single-use consumable probe, including MicroPulse P3®, G-Probe® and G-Probe Illuminate® delivery devices, and EndoProbe handpieces. In the offices and clinics, ophthalmologists use our laser systems with either an indirect laser ophthalmoscope or a slit-lamp adapter.
 In 2022 and 2021, our products were sold in the United States and Germany predominantly through a direct sales force and internationally (aside from Germany) primarily through Topcon Corporation (“Topcon”) and other independent distributors. Total revenues in 2022 and 2021 were $57.0 million and $53.9 million, respectively. We generated net losses of $7.5 million and $5.2 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.


Iridex Corporation was incorporated in California in February 1989 as IRIS Medical Instruments, Inc. In January 1996, we changed our name to Iridex Corporation and reincorporated in Delaware. Our executive offices are located at 1212 Terra Bella Avenue, Mountain View, California 94043-1824, and our telephone number is (650) 940-4700.

Impact of Macroeconomic Conditions, Including the COVID-19 Pandemic to our Business
 
Current macroeconomic conditions, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to mitigate its impact, recessionary fears, inflation concerns, and rising interest rates as a result of government actions to combat inflation, as well as other geopolitical developments, have impacted and may continue to impact business spending and the economy as a whole.
 The macroeconomic conditions on our business and operations remains highly uncertain, and it is not possible for us to predict the duration and extent to which they will affect our business, future results of operations, and financial condition.
 For more information on risks associated with macroeconomic conditions, including the COVID-19 pandemic, see the section titled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I. For more information on the impact of macroeconomic conditions, including the COVID-19 pandemic, on our business, see the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation” in Item 7 of Part II.
 Our Market Opportunity
 The global ophthalmology market is experiencing significant growth, driven by the aging population and the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases. Our focus is on the glaucoma and retina disease markets, which represent a significant portion of this market.
Glaucoma
 Glaucoma is a progressive, chronic disease most recognized by high intraocular pressure (“IOP”). Elevated IOP is often caused by too much aqueous humor (the thin watery fluid that fills the front of the eye) being produced, not enough being drained, or a combination of both. It is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, with an estimated 80-100 million candidates for treatment. Although reducing IOP is the only proven treatment, the traditional options of pharmaceuticals and incisional surgery have significant shortcomings, such as poor patient compliance, financial burden, impact to lifestyle, and side-effects more invasive than MP laser treatments. These limitations create an unmet medical need in the management of glaucoma patients. Given these limitations, there is a growing interest in alternative approaches that can provide comparable or better outcomes with a better safety profile at a lower cost. Our company is poised to address this unmet medical need and capture a significant market opportunity.
Medical Retina
 Our medical retina business is focused on providing innovative and effective treatments for retinal disorders, which if left untreated, can lead to vision loss and blindness. It is estimated that 463 million people worldwide had diabetes in 2019, and this number is expected to increase to 578 million by 2030 and as many as 700 million by 2045, according to the International Diabetes Federation. Previous clinical studies have shown that 28.5% of diabetic patients may develop some form of diabetic retinopathy.
For some retinal disorders, traditional treatments such as standard CW laser photocoagulation and injected pharmaceuticals have significant shortcomings. CW laser photocoagulation can stabilize vision over the long term but can also result in varying degrees of vision loss, while pharmaceuticals require repeated painful injections that may cause side effects including an increased risk of eye infections. Furthermore, the repeated injections are demanding on physicians, patients, and the healthcare system in terms of time and cost. As a result, there is a growing interest in alternative approaches that can provide comparable or better patient outcomes with an improved safety profile at lower costs. Our medical retina business is dedicated to developing and providing such innovative and effective treatments for retinal diseases.
Our Solution
 Our traditional laser technology was developed to perform laser photocoagulation by using a mode that delivers continuously-on laser light, which is referred to as CW mode. Laser photocoagulation generates a local healing response and has been demonstrated to be a safe and effective therapy with long-term benefits for certain ophthalmic procedures. However, use of the CW mode typically leads to local tissue damage and can cause loss of visual function, which limits the applications of the technology.
  Our solutions build on traditional CW laser and innovative technology, such as:
 •Our proprietary MicroPulse technology chops a CW laser beam into an envelope of repetitive short “ON” pulses with longer “OFF” periods that allow tissue to cool between pulses. CW laser is analogous to holding your hand still over a candle flame; your hand will quickly burn. MicroPulse is analogous to moving your hand quickly in and out of the candle flame; your hand has time to cool between passes to avoid burning. MicroPulse has been clinically proven to be effective and safe for the treatment of glaucoma and retinal diseases, with a growing body of clinical evidence published over the past decade. We have developed three applications of our MicroPulse technology for the treatment of eye diseases, providing a range of options for physicians and patients seeking improved outcomes with reduced risks.
 •Our Endpoint Management technology allows clinicians to titrate the laser to subvisible, tissue-sparing levels using a proprietary energy delivery algorithm for the treatment of retinal diseases and glaucoma. By use of this formula, heat induced changes in the retina are controlled as Endpoint Management simultaneously modulates the laser power and duration providing linear control over a non-linear process.
 •Our pattern scanning laser technology efficiently delivers large laser patterns reducing treatment time and patient discomfort during treatment. PASCAL represents an improvement in ophthalmic treatment technology and is committed to helping physicians deliver effective results for patients. Ophthalmologists choose PASCAL because of its speed and ease of use.
 Market Opportunities with Iridex' Technology Solutions
 


Market Opportunities | Iridex Technologies | Laser Systems, Delivery Devices & Overview 
Glaucoma | MicroPulse Increase outflow via uveoscleral pathway | Treats glaucoma using our Cyclo G6 laser system and MicroPulse P3 delivery device. MicroPulse P3 is Iridex’s proprietary, single-use, disposable probe. It delivers MicroPulse laser transsclerally (through the white of the eye) to target the ciliary body inside the eye. The ciliary body controls various ocular functions including aqueous humor production, and it helps facilitate the reduction of aqueous humor via outflow channels.Transscleral laser therapy (“TLT”) using MicroPulse technology is a non-incisional treatment that is believed to reduce IOP primarily through uveoscleral outflow. Numerous peer-reviewed published clinical studies have demonstrated MicroPulse TLT as a safe and clinically effective treatment to lower patients’ IOP and reduce the number of topical eye drops and oral medications across a wide spectrum of glaucoma types and disease severity. Glaucoma specialists and comprehensive ophthalmologists incorporate MicroPulse TLT prior to, concurrent with, and after other surgical therapies. It’s a repeatable procedure which doesn’t impact the patient’s quality of life nor does it inhibit future interventions.
Glaucoma | MicroPulse Increase outflow via trabecular meshwork | Treats glaucoma with our IQ laser systems. MicroPulse laser is delivered through a mechanical and optical delivery device and targets the trabecular meshwork. Physicians describe the technique as MicroPulse Laser Trabeculoplasty (“MLT”). It is believed that the MLT procedure improves trabecular meshwork outflow and thus lowers IOP. We believe that the MLT procedure provides incremental clinical benefits relative to other laser trabeculoplasty procedures such as SLT. 
Glaucoma | PSLTIncrease outflow via trabecular meshwork | Pattern Scanning Laser Trabeculoplasty (PSLT) is a computer-guided therapy that provides precise placement of laser patterns along the trabecular meshwork, independent of the visibility of lesions. PSLT provides rapid, precise, and subvisible computer-guided treatment with exact placement of the patterns for the lowering of IOP. 
Glaucoma | CWReduce inflow | Treats glaucoma using our Cyclo G6 laser system and G-Probe or G-Probe Illuminate delivery device. The Iridex G-Probe is a fiber-optic laser delivery device used to selectively ablate ciliary processes in patients who require treatment for refractory glaucoma. Delivery is transscleral (through the white of the eye). The G-Probe Illuminate provides built-in transillumination for optimized probe placement and therapeutic outcome. 


Medical Retina | MicroPulse | Treats Retinal Disorders with our IQ laser system. MicroPulse laser is administered through our TxCell Pattern Scanning Slit Lamp Adapter or standard slit lamp adapter. Studies have demonstrated that for the treatment of retinal disorders, MicroPulse laser therapy has several competitive advantages over alternate therapies with respect to long term vision stability, visual function, and cost effectiveness. 
Medical Retina | CW Endpoint ManagementMicroPulse | Treats Retinal Disorders with our PASCAL laser system. PASCAL efficiently delivers large laser patterns reducing treatment time and patient discomfort during treatment of retinal disorders using standard CW laser therapy or sub-threshold Endpoint Management. MicroPulse laser is administered through the integrated slit lamp on our PASCAL laser system. Studies have demonstrated that for the treatment of retinal disorders, MicroPulse laser therapy has several competitive advantages over alternate therapies with respect to long term vision stability, visual function, and cost effectiveness.
Surgical Retina | CW | The Iridex EndoProbe is used with our IQ and OcuLight lasers. EndoProbe handpieces are used to treat proliferative diabetic retinopathy, macular holes, retinal tears and detachments. These disposable probes are available in tapered, angled, stepped, aspirating, illuminating, and adjustable styles, as well as a wide variety of sizes. The EndoProbe is a sterile disposable product. 

Our Strategy
 As a global leader in developing, manufacturing, marketing, selling and servicing innovative medical laser systems and associated instrumentation for the treatment of sight-threatening eye diseases, we aim to capitalize on our strong brand and distribution network within the ophthalmology market. Our goal is to promote MicroPulse as a credible treatment option for glaucoma and retinal diseases, while also commercializing a range of products that enhance therapeutic outcomes for patients, streamline physician efficiency, reduce costs, and provide economic benefits to healthcare systems. We are committed to pursuing a variety of organic initiatives, with potential acquisitions serving as a complementary strategy and complementary inorganic initiatives. Through the successful execution of this strategy, we anticipate driving profitable growth and creating increased shareholder value.
 To achieve these goals, we are pursuing several organic initiatives that we anticipate will be supplemented from time to time by acquisitions, such as the asset acquisition completed with one of the subsidiaries for Topcon. We anticipate that the successful execution of this strategy will lead to profitable growth and enhanced shareholder value.
 Our Products
 Our products are designed with a system approach in mind, with each system consisting of a laser console that generates laser energy, along with a range of interchangeable delivery devices or single-use disposable probes for use in specific clinical applications. This enables our customers to invest in a basic laser system and expand their therapeutic capabilities over time, with the ability to add additional delivery devices or disposable probes as needed. Our product line currently comprises three main categories: (1) laser consoles, (2) delivery devices, which are optical-mechanical products that can be mounted to ophthalmologists' diagnostic equipment and transmit the laser energy, and (3) single-use disposable probes, which deliver the laser energy to targeted regions inside the eye.
Laser Consoles
 Our laser consoles, which are identified below, incorporate the economic and technical benefits of solid state and semiconductor laser technology to design small, portable and reliable lasers.
Glaucoma:
 Cyclo G6 Laser System. The Cyclo G6 is an infrared (810nm) laser designed to treat patients diagnosed with a range of glaucoma disease states. The Cyclo G6 system is sold with a family of probes that are disposable, including our patented MicroPulse P3 probe that utilizes our MicroPulse technology, our G-Probe and G-Probe Illuminate.
 PASCAL Laser System. The new Iridex PASCAL is available in either 532 nm or 577 nm wavelengths. Pattern Scanning Laser Trabeculoplasty (“PSLT”) is a tissue-sparing laser treatment for reducing IOP in open angle glaucoma. PSLT provides a rapid, precise, and minimally traumatic computer-guided treatment that applies a sequence of patterns onto the trabecular meshwork.
 Medical retina:
 IQ Laser System. Our IQ laser systems offer our MicroPulse technology but also have CW capabilities. Our IQ 577 delivers visible yellow (577nm) laser light and our IQ 532 delivers visible green (532nm) laser light. Our IQ laser systems are typically used with our TxCell® Scanning Laser Delivery System and our Slit Lamp Adapters when used to treat retinal disorders with MicroPulse.
 PASCAL Laser System. The new Iridex PASCAL is available in either 532 nm or 577 nm wavelengths. It offers the ultimate combination of pattern scanning, Endpoint Management Technology, Pattern Scanning Laser Trabeculoplasty, and now, MicroPulse Technology, providing physicians with expanded treatment capabilities in a smaller, ergonomically-optimized laser platform.
 Surgical retina: Our OcuLight TX laser delivers visible green (532nm) laser light. Our OcuLight SLx laser delivers infrared (810 nm) laser light.
Delivery Devices
 The following delivery devices are typically used with our IQ and OcuLight laser systems:
 Slit Lamp Adapter (“SLA”). These adapters allow the physician to utilize a standard slit lamp in both diagnosis and treatment procedures. Physicians can install an SLA in a few minutes and convert standard diagnostic slit lamps into a therapeutic laser delivery system. SLAs are used in treatment procedures for both retinal diseases and glaucoma.
Laser Indirect Ophthalmoscope (“LIO”). The indirect ophthalmoscope is designed to be worn on the physician’s head and to be used in procedures to treat peripheral retinal disorders, particularly in infants or adults requiring treatment in the supine position. This product can be used in both diagnosis and treatment procedures at the point-of-care.

Single-use disposable probes
 The following delivery device is typically used with our IQ laser systems:
TxCell Scanning Laser Delivery System (“TxCell”). TxCell allows the physician to perform multi-spot pattern scanning for efficient delivery of MicroPulse laser therapy.
MicroPulse P3 Probe. The MicroPulse P3 delivery device is used with our Cyclo G6 laser system to perform transscleral laser therapy (“TLT”) using MicroPulse technology. The MicroPulse P3 probe is used on an anesthetized eye in the doctor’s office or in the operating rooms. The non-incisional procedure takes just a few minutes and results in minimal post-operative recovery for the patient. MicroPulse TLT may be used to treat a wide variety of glaucoma types, including open-angle and closed-angle glaucoma, and a broad range of disease severity.
 Since the launch of the MicroPulse P3 probe in 2015, we have worked with physicians to optimize treatment techniques and clinical outcomes. During our collaborations, we learned that minor ergonomic probe modifications could facilitate easier use and result in more consistent clinical outcomes. In Q4 2019, we released a revised MicroPulse P3 probe that reflects these modifications. Initial feedback from approximately 150 physicians has been very positive in terms of better viewing of the treatment area, ease of treating small eyes and deep-set eyes, more intuitive probe orientation and placement, better stabilization of the probe on the eye, and improved light coupling to the tissue. In addition, physicians have continued to observe excellent safety profiles and good preliminary clinical results.
 In 2021, an international panel of 10 glaucoma experts was formed to provide peer-driven contemporary clinical guidance on the use and indications of the revised MicroPulse P3 Probe and Cyclo G6 Laser System for the treatment of glaucoma. They performed a complete analysis of MicroPulse TLT clinical, technical, and practical experience to date, and then conducted a three-round Delphi method to develop recommendations for its clinical application. Two peer-reviewed manuscripts from Clinical Ophthalmology, an international peer-reviewed journal, document their findings and recommendations, and conclude that used with proper energy settings, techniques and treatment indications, MicroPulse TLT is a safe and effective treatment for many cases of glaucoma and is a useful addition to the glaucoma treatment armamentarium.
 G-Probe® . The G-Probe is used in procedures to treat uncontrolled glaucoma, typically described as “refractory glaucoma.” The G-Probe delivers CW laser to the ciliary body and is believed to stop the production of aqueous humor, thus reducing IOP. The G-Probe’s non-invasive procedure takes approximately ten minutes and is performed on an anesthetized eye in the doctor’s office or operating rooms. The G-Probe is a sterile disposable product.
G-Probe Illuminate®. The G-Probe Illuminate is also used in procedures to treat refractory glaucoma. The proprietary illumination feature allows for more targeted treatment and may offer additional clinical benefits. The G-Probe Illuminate is a sterile disposable product.
 EndoProbe® Handpieces. Our EndoProbe family of products are used for endophotocoagulation, a retinal treatment procedure performed in the hospital operating rooms or ambulatory surgical centers during a vitrectomy procedure. Vitrectomy procedures are performed to treat proliferative diabetic retinopathy, macular holes, retinal tears and detachments. These disposable probes are available in tapered, angled, stepped, aspirating, illuminating, and adjustable styles, as well as a wide variety of sizes. The EndoProbe is a sterile disposable product.
 Research and Development
 We have close working relationships with researchers, clinicians and practicing physicians around the world who provide new ideas, evaluate prototypes and assist us in validating new products and new applications before they are introduced.
Our internal research and development (“R&D”) activities are performed by a current team of 20 engineers and regulatory professionals with experience in various aspects of medical products, laser systems, delivery devices, clinical techniques, and regulatory affairs with a focus on introducing innovative products which satisfy the unmet and emerging needs of our customers. The core competencies of the team include: mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, optics, lasers, fiber optics, software, and industrial designs. The R&D process integrates all of the necessary disciplines from product inception through customer acceptance. This process facilitates reliable new product innovations and a consistent pipeline of innovative products for our customers.
Our research activities are managed internally by our R&D staff. We supplement our internal R&D staff by hiring consultants or partnering with physicians known for their expertise. Research efforts are directed toward the development of new products, as well as the identification of markets not currently addressed by our products.
We believe that it is important to make a substantial contribution to improving clinical outcomes. For instance, we have made substantial investments in improving the treatment of serious eye diseases such as glaucoma and retinal disease. The

objectives of developing new treatments and applications are to expand the patient population, to better and more economically treat diseases, to treat patients earlier in the treatment regimen and to reduce the side effects of treatment.
We consider clinical projects to be a component of our R&D efforts and they may or may not result in additional commercial opportunities.
 Customers and Customer Support
 Our products are currently sold for use by ophthalmologists specializing in the treatment of eye disease in retina, glaucoma and pediatric eye diseases. Other customers include research and teaching hospitals, government installations, surgical centers, hospitals, veterinary practices, and office clinics (outpatient).
We seek to provide superior customer support and service and believe that our customer service and technical support distinguish our product offerings from those of our competitors. We provide depot service at our Mountain View facility for our products. Our customer support representatives assist customers with orders, warranty returns and other administrative functions. Our technical support engineers provide customers with answers to technical and product-related questions. We maintain an “around-the-clock” telephone service line to service our customers. If a problem with a depot serviceable product cannot be diagnosed and resolved by telephone, a service loaner is shipped overnight to domestic customers under warranty or service contract, and by the most rapid delivery means available to our international customers, and the problem unit is returned to us. The small size and rugged design of our products allows for economical shipment and quick response to customers worldwide.
Sales and Marketing
 Our sales and marketing strategies for 2022 focused on the United States and Germany, primarily through our direct sales team, while we worked with independent distributors for international sales (excluding Germany). We have 28 direct sales personnel in the United States, one in Germany, and seven team members dedicated to managing our distribution sales efforts globally. Sales operations are managed from our headquarters in Mountain View, California. In 2022, international sales accounted for 48.8% of our revenues, respectively. We anticipate that our international sales will remain a significant contributor to our revenue in the future. Our customers are located in Europe, Asia, the Pacific Rim, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. We usually enter into exclusive distribution agreements with our international distributors that can be terminated by either party with a 90-day notice.
International sales may be affected by factors such as currency fluctuations, governmental controls, export technology restrictions, political instability, trade restrictions, tariff changes, tax treaties, and economic conditions in each country where we sell our products.
To support our sales activities, we utilize various marketing programs including our website, social media, email marketing, clinical education, trade shows, public relations, market research, key opinion leader collaborations, and advertising in trade and academic journals and newsletters. We also participate in annual trade shows worldwide, which allow us to showcase our products to existing and potential customers.
Our marketing programs help us collaborate with customers to identify new product ideas and applications that address their needs, enabling us to develop new products, identify new applications for our products, and validate new procedures using our products. Our customers include key opinion leaders in ophthalmology, often heads of departments or university professors. We believe that these experts are critical to the successful introduction of new products and their subsequent acceptance in the market. The validation and commercialization of our new products depend on early adoption by these opinion leaders.
Clinical Affairs
 We have established a Clinical Affairs group to facilitate clinical research opportunities, provide specialized ophthalmic surgeon training and credentialing for our proprietary MicroPulse products, develop strong relationships with prominent key opinion leaders, and ensure the accuracy and consistency of our messaging to the market. We recognize that a robust research program and professional training for our customers are essential in driving the application of our technology for widespread and consistent use, and our Clinical Affairs group is dedicated to achieving these goals.
Operations
 The manufacture of our visible light and infrared laser consoles and the related delivery devices is a highly complex and precise process. Completed systems must pass quality control testing and quality assurance review before shipment. Our manufacturing activities consist of specifying, sourcing, assembling and testing of components and certain subassemblies for assembly into our final product. Currently we have a total of 17 employees engaged in manufacturing activities for these products.

The medical devices we manufacture are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities, including federal, state, and foreign governmental agencies. The principal regulators in the United States are the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and the California Department of Public Health, Food and Drug Branch. In April 1998, we received certification for ISO 9001/EN 46001, which is an international quality system standard that documents compliance to the European Medical Device Directives. In February 2004, we were certified to ISO 13485:2003, which replaced ISO 9001/EN46001 as the international standard for quality systems as applied to medical devices. In December 2018, we were certified to ISO 13485:2016, which superseded the 2003 version of the standard. In August 2008, we received FDA 510(k) clearance on our family of Iridex IQ laser systems. This clearance covers the Iridex IQ 532 Laser and IQ 577 Laser and their associated delivery devices to deliver laser energy in either CW or MicroPulse mode. In January 2015, we received FDA 510(k) clearance for Cyclo G6 Laser. In 2022 and 2023 we received FDA 510(k) clearance for the Iridex Pascal (532 nm and 577 nm models) laser system and the Iridex Laser (532 nm and 577 nm models). These laser systems are intended for a wide range of specific applications in the medical specialties of ophthalmology.
International regulatory bodies often establish varying product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. As a result of our sales in Europe, we are required to have all products “CE” marked, an international symbol affixed to all our medical device products demonstrating compliance to the European Medical Device Directives and/or Medical Device Regulations and all applicable standards. In July 1998, we received CE mark certification under Annex II guidelines, the most stringent path to CE certification. With Annex II CE mark certification, we have demonstrated our ability to both understand and comply with all applicable standards under the European Medical Device Directives. In May 2021, the Medical Device Directives were superseded by the Medical Device Regulations (“MDR”), with a transition period for our Class IIa and IIb products lasting in effect until May 2024, which allows Iridex to market these products during transition period. In February 2023, the European Parliament voted to extend the MDR transition deadline from 2024 to 2028 for our products. The Company will obtain certification of compliance to the Medical Device Regulations before the transition deadline. Currently, all of our products marketed within the EU are CE marked. Continued certification is based on successful review of quality management systems by our European Registrar (Notified Body) during its periodic audits. Any loss of certification could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We rely on third parties to manufacture substantially all of the components used in our products, although we assemble critical subassemblies and the final product at our facility in Mountain View, California. Some of these suppliers and manufacturers are sole source. We have some long-term or volume purchase agreements with our suppliers but currently purchase most components on a purchase order basis. These components may not be available in the quantities required, on reasonable terms, or at all. Financial or other difficulties faced by our suppliers or significant changes in demand for these components or materials could limit their availability. Any failures by our third-party suppliers to adequately perform may delay the submission of products for regulatory approval, impair our ability to deliver products on a timely basis or otherwise impair our competitive position.
Competition
 Competition in the market for laser systems and delivery devices used for ophthalmic treatment procedures is intense and is expected to increase. This market is also characterized by technological innovation and change. We compete by providing features and services that are valued by our customers such as: enhanced product performance and clinical outcomes, ease of use, durability, versatility, customer training services and rapid repair of equipment.
Our principal ophthalmic laser competitors are Alcon Inc., Novartis AG, Bausch Health Companies Inc., Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Lumenis Ltd., Nidek Co. Ltd., Lumibird, and Norlase. We also compete with alternative glaucoma surgical device companies such as Alcon, Inc., Allergan, Inc., Glaukos Corporation, New World Medical, Inc. and Ivantis, Inc. Pharmaceuticals represent alternative treatments to our laser procedures. Some of our principal pharmaceutical competitors are Alcon, Inc., Allergan, Inc., Astellas Pharma Inc., Pfizer Inc., Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Roche Holding Ltd. (Genentech) and Bausch Health Companies Inc. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, engineering, product development, manufacturing, marketing and technical resources than we do. Some companies also have greater name recognition than us and long-standing customer relationships. In addition, other medical companies, academic and research institutions, or others, may develop new technologies or therapies, including medical devices, surgical procedures or pharmacological treatments and obtain regulatory approval for products utilizing such techniques that are more effective in treating the conditions targeted by us, or are less expensive than our current or future products. Our technologies and products could be rendered obsolete by such developments. Any such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Patents and Proprietary Rights
 Our success and ability to compete is dependent in part upon our proprietary information. We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, copyright and trademark laws, nondisclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights. These are either developed internally or obtained from acquisitions that we make.

We file patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements that are significant to the development of our business. Our patent portfolio includes 62 active United States patents and 85 active international patents on the technologies related to our products and processes. In addition, we have 11 patent applications pending in the United States and 21 international patent applications pending. Our patent applications may not be approved.
 In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how which we seek to protect, in part, through proprietary information agreements with employees, consultants and other parties. Our proprietary information agreements with our employees and consultants contain provisions requiring such individuals to assign to us, without additional consideration, any inventions conceived or reduced to practice by them while employed or retained by us, subject to customary exceptions. We can provide no assurance that our employees and consultants will abide by the provisions of these agreements and that our confidential information and trade secrets will be protected.
 Government Regulation
 The medical devices marketed and manufactured by us are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities, including federal, state, and foreign governmental agencies. Pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act”), as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, the FDA serves as the principal federal agency within the United States with authority over medical devices and regulates the research, clinical testing, manufacture, labeling, distribution, sale, marketing and promotion of such devices. Noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in, among other things, warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizures of products, total or partial suspension of production, failure of the government to grant pre-market clearance or approval for devices, withdrawal of marketing approvals, and criminal prosecution. The FDA also has the authority to request repair, replacement or refund of the cost of any medical device manufactured or distributed by us.
In the United States, medical devices are classified into one of three classes - Class I, II or III. The class to which the device is assigned determines, among other things, the type of pre-marketing submission/application required for FDA clearance to market. If the device is classified as Class I or II, and if it is not exempt, a 510(k) pre-market notification will be required for marketing. Under FDA regulations, Class I devices are mostly subject to general controls (for example, labeling, pre-market notification and adherence to Quality System Regulations (“QSRs”) requirements). Class II devices typically receive marketing clearance through a 510(k) pre-market notification. For Class III devices, a pre-market approval (“PMA”) application will be required unless the device is a pre-amendments device (on the market prior to the passage of the medical device amendments in 1976, or substantially equivalent to such a device) and PMAs have not been called for. In that case, a 510(k) will be the route to market. A 510(k) clearance will be granted if the submitted information establishes that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed Class I or II medical device, or to a Class III medical device for which the FDA has not called for a PMA. The FDA may determine that a proposed device is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device or that additional information or data are needed before a substantial equivalence determination can be made. A request for additional data may require that clinical studies and/or non-clinical studies of the device’s safety and effectiveness be performed.
In the United States, commercial distribution of a device for which a 510(k) notification is required can begin only after the FDA issues an order finding the device to be substantially equivalent to a previously cleared device. The FDA has recently been requiring a more rigorous demonstration of substantial equivalence than in the past. Even in cases where the FDA grants a 510(k) clearance, it can take the FDA between one and six months from the date of submission to grant a 510(k) clearance, but it may take longer.
A “not substantially equivalent” determination, or a request for additional information, could delay the market introduction of new products that fall into this category and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For any of our products that are cleared through the 510(k) process, modifications or enhancements that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device or that constitute a major change to the intended use of the device will require new 510(k) submissions.
We have obtained 510(k) clearances for all of our medical device products marketed within the United States that require 510(k) clearance. We have also modified aspects of our products since receiving regulatory clearance, and we have submitted 510(k)s for those modifications as required by FDA regulations. After a device receives a 510(k) clearance or a PMA, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new clearance or approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with our determination not to seek a new 510(k) clearance or PMA, the FDA may retroactively require us to seek 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval. The FDA could also require us to cease marketing and distribution and/or recall the modified device until a 510(k) clearance or a PMA approval is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA clearances or approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including record keeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences with the use

of the device. Device manufacturers are required to register their establishments and list their devices with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies. The FD&C Act requires devices to be manufactured to comply with applicable QSR regulations which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us with respect to design, development, manufacturing and quality assurance activities. We are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA and the Food and Drug Branch of the California Department of Public Health, to determine our compliance with the QSR and other regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors.
Labeling and promotion activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and in certain instances, by the Federal Trade Commission. The FDA actively enforces regulations prohibiting marketing of products for unapproved uses. We and our products are also subject to a variety of state laws and regulations in those states or localities where our products are or will be marketed. Any applicable state or local regulations may hinder our ability to market our products in those states or localities. Manufacturers are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may be required to incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future. Such laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect upon our ability to do business.
 Export of our products is regulated by the FDA and subject to the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. §§321-397, and other statutes FDA administers, which greatly expanded the export of approved and unapproved United States medical devices. However, some foreign countries require manufacturers to provide a specific type of FDA export certificate (such as a Certificate to Foreign Government or Certificate of Exportability) which requires the device manufacturer to certify to the FDA that the product has been granted pre-market clearance in the United States and that the manufacturing facilities appeared to be in compliance with QSR at the time of the last QSR inspection. The FDA will refuse to issue any export certificate if significant outstanding QSR violations exist.
 We are also regulated under the Radiation Control provisions (originally enacted as the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act of 1968) which are located in Sections 531 through 542 of the FD&C Act, which requires laser products to comply with performance standards, including design and operation requirements, and manufacturers to certify in product labeling and in reports to the FDA that their products comply with all such standards. The law also requires laser manufacturers to file new product and annual reports, maintain manufacturing, testing and sales records and report product defects. Various warning labels must be affixed and certain protective devices installed, depending on the class of the product.
The introduction of our products in foreign markets will also subject us to foreign regulatory clearances which may impose substantial additional costs and burdens. International sales of medical devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country. The regulatory review process varies from country to country. Many countries also impose product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements and import restrictions on devices. In addition, each country has its own tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. The approval by the FDA and foreign government authorities is unpredictable and uncertain. The necessary approvals or clearances may not be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in receipt of, or a failure to receive, such approvals or clearances, or the loss of any previously received approvals or clearances, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There are a number of major regulatory changes occurring in the regulation of medical devices in the European Union. The revision of the quality system regulation (ISO 13485:2016) has been released that substantially increased the requirements for a medical device quality system. The Medical Device Regulation (“MDR”) has replaced the medical device directives (93/42/EEC), and it substantially changed the way that medical devices are brought to market in the European Union and how they maintain compliance throughout the product’s life cycle. Additionally, the new revision 4 of the clinical evaluation report guidance document (MEDDEV 2.7.1) and the Medical Device Coordination Group (MDCG) guidance document “Regulation (EU) 2017/745: Clinical evidence needed for medical devices previously CE marked under Directives 93/42/EEC or 90/385/EEC” (MDCG 2020-6) severely restricts the use of substantial equivalence for new products, resulting in the need for formal clinical trial data for many new products. These changes will increase the cost for compliance and for product development, and they lengthen product introduction cycles. Failure to comply with these changes can have an adverse effect on our ability to release new products in a timely manner.
 In order to maintain a Canadian Medical Device License (“MDL”), which is needed to sell a medical device in Canada, the holder of the MDL (the “regulatory manufacturer”) must obtain an ISO 13485:2016 certificate through the Medical Device Single Audit Program (“MDSAP”). The MDSAP requirement is new to Canada, and manufacturers that received an MDL prior to adoption of this requirement are required to transition to the MDSAP. To address this Canadian medical device licensing requirement, Iridex transferred its MDLs to Salient Medical Solutions (“Salient”), Iridex’s distributor in Canada and an entity that is certified under MDSAP. Iridex continues to fabricate the devices as Salient’s contract manufacturer. Salient is now the regulatory manufacturer, and has the licenses necessary to import and sell Iridex’s products into Canada.
Changes in existing requirements or adoption of new requirements or policies by the FDA or other foreign and domestic regulatory authorities could adversely affect our ability to comply with regulatory requirements. Failure to comply

with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be required to incur significant costs to comply with laws and regulations in the future. These laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 Reimbursement
 The cost of a significant portion of medical care in the United States is funded by government programs, health maintenance organizations and private insurance plans. Our ophthalmology products are typically purchased by doctors, clinics, hospitals and other users, which bill various third-party payers, such as government programs and private insurance plans, for the health care services provided to their patients. Government imposed limits on reimbursement of hospitals and other health care providers have significantly affected the spending budgets of doctors, clinics and hospitals to acquire new equipment, including our products. Under certain government insurance programs, a health care provider is reimbursed for a fixed sum for services rendered in treating a patient, regardless of the actual charge for such treatment. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services reimburses hospitals on a prospectively-determined fixed amount basis for the costs associated with an in-patient hospitalization based on the patient’s discharge diagnosis, regardless of the actual costs incurred by the hospital or physician in furnishing the care and regardless of the specific devices used in that procedure.
Private third-party reimbursement plans are also developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling health-care costs by imposing limitations on reimbursable procedures and the exploration of more cost-effective methods of delivering health care. In general, these government and private measures have caused health care providers, including our customers, to be more selective in the purchase of medical products. In addition, changes in government regulation or in private third-party payers’ policies may limit or eliminate reimbursement for procedures employing our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Doctors, clinics, hospitals and other users of our products may not obtain adequate reimbursement for use of our products from third-party payers. While we believe that the laser procedures using our products have generally been reimbursed, payers may deny coverage and reimbursement for our products if they determine that the device was not reasonable and necessary for the purpose used, was investigational or was not cost-effective.
Backlog and Seasonality
 We generally do not maintain a material level of backlog. As a result, we do not believe that our backlog at any particular time is indicative of future sales levels. Our quarterly results have been, and are expected to continue to be, affected by seasonal factors. For example, our European sales during the third quarter are generally lower due to many businesses being closed for the summer vacation season.
Human Capital
 Our employees are our human capital and they are our greatest strength and most valuable resource. As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of 130 full-time equivalent employees engaged in our ongoing operations, including 52 in operations (including manufacturing, quality, logistics and service), 46 in sales and marketing which does not include six consultants and two independent sales representatives, 20 in R&D and 12 in finance and administration. We also employ, from time to time, a number of temporary and part-time employees as well as consultants on a contract basis. As of December 31, 2022, we had 34 such persons serving in such roles.
 Our human capital resources objectives include identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. We continuously invest in our workforce by seeking to create a diverse, inclusive, and safe work environment where our employees can learn, innovate, and deliver their best. We are committed to being inclusive to enable our workforce and customers to succeed.
 Our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining organization, and we have never experienced a work stoppage or strike. We consider our employee relations to be good.
