Item 1.  Business
General
First Financial Northwest, Inc. (“First Financial Northwest” or the “Company”), a Washington corporation, was formed on June 1, 2007, for the purpose of becoming the holding company for First Financial Northwest Bank (“the Bank”) in connection with the Bank’s conversion from a mutual holding company structure to a stock holding company structure which was completed on October 9, 2007. At December 31, 2018, the Company had total assets of $1.3 billion, net loans of $1.0 billion, deposits of $939.0 million and stockholders’ equity of $153.7 million. First Financial Northwest’s business activities generally are limited to passive investment activities and oversight of its investment in First Financial Northwest Bank. Accordingly, the information set forth in this report, including consolidated financial statements and related data, relates primarily to First Financial Northwest Bank.
The Bank was organized in 1923 as a Washington state-chartered savings and loan association, converted to a federal mutual savings and loan association in 1935 and to a Washington state-chartered mutual savings bank in 1992. In 2002, First Savings Bank reorganized into a two-tier mutual holding company structure, became a stock savings bank, and the wholly-owned subsidiary of First Financial of Renton, Inc. In connection with the 2002 conversion, First Savings Bank changed its name to First Savings Bank Northwest. Subsequently, in August 2015, the Bank changed its name to First Financial Northwest Bank to better reflect the commercial banking services it provides beyond those typically provided by a traditional savings bank. In February 2016, the Bank officially changed its charter from a Washington chartered stock savings bank to a Washington chartered commercial bank. 
First Financial Northwest became a bank holding company, after converting from a savings and loan holding company on March 31, 2015, and is subject to regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board” or “Federal Reserve”) through the FRB. The change was consistent with First Financial Northwest Bank’s shift in focus from a traditional savings and loan association towards a full service, commercial bank. Additionally, First Financial Northwest Bank is examined and regulated by the DFI and by the FDIC. First Financial Northwest Bank is required to maintain reserves at a level set by the Federal Reserve Board. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) of Des Moines, which is one of the 11 regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System (“FHLB System”). For additional information, see “How We are Regulated - Regulation and Supervision of First Financial Northwest Bank - Federal Home Loan Bank System.”
In February 2016, First Financial Northwest Bank converted its charter from a community-based savings bank to a commercial bank as a way of better serving its customer needs. The Bank’s largest concentration of customers is in King County, with additional concentrations in Snohomish, Pierce, and Kitsap counties, Washington. The Bank is headquartered in Renton, in King County, where it has a full-service branch as well as a smaller branch located in a commercial development known as “The Landing”. The Bank has additional smaller branches in King County located in Bellevue, Woodinville, and Bothell, and opened a new branch in Kent in the first quarter of 2019. In Snohomish County, Washington, the Bank has five additional branches located in Mill Creek, Edmonds, Clearview, Smokey Point, and Lake Stevens. These smaller branches are focused on efficiency through the extensive use of the latest banking technology. First Financial Northwest Bank’s business consists of attracting deposits from the public and utilizing these funds to originate one-to-four family residential, multifamily, commercial real estate, construction/land, business and consumer loans.
The principal executive office of First Financial Northwest is located at 201 Wells Avenue South, Renton, Washington, 98057; our telephone number is (425) 255-4400.
Market Area
We consider our primary market area to be the Puget Sound Region that consists primarily of King, Snohomish and, to a lesser extent, Pierce and Kitsap counties. During 2018, the Puget Sound Region experienced strong appreciation in residential real estate prices throughout much of the year similar to trends in recent periods. However, price appreciation in more expensive areas of King County such as Seattle and Bellevue have slowed recently due to affordability issues and higher mortgage rates. List prices in Snohomish, Pierce and Kitsap counties are lower than King County and properties have continued to experience price appreciation higher than the national average.

Lending Activities
General. We focus our lending activities primarily on loans secured by commercial real estate, construction/land, first mortgages on one-to-four family residences, multifamily, and business lending. We offer a variety of secured consumer loans, including savings account loans and home equity loans that include lines of credit and second mortgage term loans. As of December 31, 2018, our net loan portfolio totaled $1.0 billion and represented 81.7% of our total assets.
Our current loan policy generally limits the maximum amount of loans we can make to one borrower to 15% of the Bank’s total risk-based capital, or $21.0 million at December 31, 2018. Exceptions to this policy are allowed only with the prior approval of the Board of Directors and if the borrower exhibits financial strength or sufficient, measurable compensating factors exist after consideration of the loan-to-value ratio, borrower’s financial condition, net worth, credit history, earnings capacity, installment obligations, and current payment history. The regulatory limit of loans we can make to one borrower is 20% of total risk-based capital, or $28.0 million, at December 31, 2018. At this date, our single largest lending relationship, totaling $21.9 million, exceeded our internal lending guideline and was approved by the Board of Directors in accordance with our loan policy.
During 2018, the concentration of loans to our five largest lending relationships decreased. At December 31, 2018, loans to our five largest lending relationships totaled $79.9 million compared to $88.5 million at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $8.6 million, or 9.8%. Not only did the total of these relationships decrease during 2018, their percentage of total loans, net of loans in process (“LIP”) also decreased to 7.7% at December 31, 2018 from 8.8% at December 31, 2017. The total number of loans comprising these relationships increased slightly to 19 at December 31, 2018 from 18 at December 31, 2017.

One-to-Four Family Residential Lending. As of December 31, 2018, $342.0 million, or 30.5% of our total loan portfolio consisted of loans secured by one-to-four family residences.
First Financial Northwest Bank is a traditional portfolio lender when it comes to financing residential home loans. In 2018, we originated $119.9 million and purchased $1.2 million in one-to-four family residential loans. At December 31, 2018, $194.2 million, or 56.8% of our one-to-four family residential portfolio consisted of owner occupied loans with the remaining $147.8 million, or 43.2% consisting of non-owner occupied loans. In addition, at December 31, 2018, $185.8 million, or 54.3% of our one-to-four family residential loan portfolio consisted of fixed-rate loans. Substantially all of our one-to-four family residential loans require monthly principal and interest payments.
Our fixed-rate, one-to-four family residential loans are generally originated with 15 to 30 year terms, although such loans typically remain outstanding for substantially shorter periods, particularly in the current low interest rate environment. We also originate hybrid loans with initial fixed-rate terms of five to ten years that convert to variable-rate which adjusts annually thereafter. In addition, substantially all of our one-to-four family residential loans contain due-on-sale clauses that allow us to declare the unpaid amount due and payable upon the sale of the property securing the loan. Typically, we enforce these due‑on‑sale clauses to the extent permitted by law and as a standard course of business. The average period of time a loan is outstanding is a function of, among other factors, the level of purchase and sale activity in the real estate market, prevailing interest rates, and the interest rates payable on outstanding loans.
Our lending policy generally limits the maximum loan-to-value ratio on mortgage loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties to 85% of the lesser of the appraised value or the purchase price. Properties securing our one-to-four family residential loans are appraised by independent appraisers approved by us. We require the borrowers to obtain title insurance and if necessary, flood insurance. We generally do not require earthquake insurance due to competitive market factors.
Loans secured by rental properties represent potentially higher risk and, as a result, we adhere to more stringent underwriting guidelines. Of primary concern in non-owner occupied real estate lending is the consistency of rental income of the property. Payments on loans secured by rental properties depend primarily on the tenants’ continuing ability to pay rent to the property owner, the character of the borrower or, if the property owner is unable to find a tenant, the property owner’s ability to repay the loan without the benefit of a rental income stream. In addition, successful operation and management of non-owner occupied properties, including property maintenance standards, may affect repayment. As a result, repayment of such loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. We request that borrowers and loan guarantors, if any, provide annual financial statements, a budget factoring in a rental income cash flow analysis of the borrower as well as the net operating income of the property, information concerning the borrower’s expertise, credit history and profitability, and the value of the underlying property. These loans are generally secured by a first mortgage on the underlying collateral property along with an assignment of rents and leases. If the borrower has multiple rental property loans with us, the loans are typically not cross‑collateralized. At December 31, 2018, $382,000 of one-to-four family residential loans were in nonaccrual status, although $110,000 of these loans were performing in accordance with their repayment terms at that date.
Multifamily and Commercial Real Estate Lending. As of December 31, 2018, $169.4 million, or 15.1% of our total loan portfolio was secured by multifamily and $373.8 million, or 33.3% of our loan portfolio was secured by commercial real estate properties. Our commercial real estate loans are typically secured by office and medical buildings, retail shopping centers, mini-storage facilities, industrial use buildings and warehouses. Commercial real estate and multifamily loans are subject to similar underwriting standards and processes. These loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. 
Typically, multifamily and commercial real estate loans have higher balances, are more complex to evaluate and monitor, and involve a greater degree of risk than one-to-four-family residential loans. In an attempt to compensate for and mitigate this risk, these loans are generally priced at higher interest rates than one-to-four family residential loans and generally have a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 80% of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price. We generally require loan guarantees by any parties with a property ownership interest of 20% or more. If the borrower is a corporation or partnership, we generally require personal guarantees from the principals based upon a review of their personal financial statements and individual credit reports.

_______________
(1) LIP for nursing home loans at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $21,000 and $544,000, respectively.
The average loan size in our multifamily and commercial real estate loan portfolios was $1.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2018. At this date, $58.8 million, or 34.7%, of our multifamily loans and $122.4 million, or 32.7%, of our commercial real estate loans were located outside of our primary market area. We currently target individual multifamily, and commercial real estate loans between $1.0 million and $5.0 million. The largest multifamily loan as of December 31, 2018, was a 105-unit apartment complex with a net outstanding principal balance of $8.7 million located in King County, Washington. As of December 31, 2018, the largest commercial real estate loan had a net outstanding balance of $13.3 million and was secured by an office building located in King County, Washington. Both of these loans were performing according to their respective loan repayment terms as of December 31, 2018.
The credit risk related to multifamily and commercial real estate loans is considered to be greater than the risk related to one-to-four family residential loans because the repayment of multifamily and commercial real estate loans typically is dependent on the income stream from the real estate securing the loan as collateral and the successful operation of the borrower’s business, that can be significantly affected by adverse conditions in the real estate markets or in the economy. For example, if the cash flow from the borrower’s project is reduced due to leases not being obtained or renewed, the borrower’s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. In addition, many of our multifamily and commercial real estate loans are not fully amortizing and contain large balloon payments upon maturity. These balloon payments generally require the borrower to either refinance or occasionally sell the underlying property in order to make the balloon payment.
If we foreclose on a multifamily or commercial real estate loan, our holding period for the collateral typically is longer than for one-to-four family residential mortgage loan foreclosures because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral. Our multifamily and commercial real estate loans generally have relatively large balances to single borrowers or related groups of borrowers. Accordingly, if we make any errors in judgment in the collectability of our multifamily or commercial real estate loans, any resulting charge-offs may be larger on a per loan basis than those incurred in our one-to-four family residential or consumer loan portfolios. At December 31, 2018, there were no multifamily loans past due 90 days or more, or in nonaccrual status. There was one commercial real estate loan with an outstanding balance of $326,000 that was in nonaccrual status and in the process of foreclosure at December 31, 2018. However, this loan was subsequently paid in full in January 2019. There were no multifamily or commercial real estate loans charged-off during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.

Construction/Land Loans. We originate construction/land loans primarily to residential builders for the construction of single-family residences, condominiums, townhouses, multifamily properties and residential developments located in our market area. Land loans include land non-development loans for the purchase or refinance of unimproved land held for future residential development, improved residential lots held for speculative investment purposes or lines of credit secured by land, and land development loans. Construction/land loans to builders generally require the borrower to have an existing relationship with the Bank and a proven record of successful projects. At December 31, 2018, our total construction/land loans were $195.3 million, or 17.4% of our total loan portfolio. The balance of our construction/land loans decreased from $237.6 million, or 21.7% of our total loans, at December 31, 2017 as loan payoffs exceeded loan originations. The Company’s strategic plan projects an increase in construction loan origination activity in 2019 as we renew our focus on these loans. The Bank’s lending policy sets forth the guideline that the balance of our acquisition, development, and construction loans, net of LIP and deferred fees and costs, not exceed 100% of the Bank’s risk-based capital. Management intends to maintain levels near this guideline, however the uncertainty of the timing associated with construction loan draws occasionally results in the actual concentration exceeding the guideline. At December 31, 2018, the Bank’s net acquisition, development, and construction loans totaled $114.9 million, for a concentration of 81.9%. There were no construction/land loans classified as nonaccrual at either December 31, 2018 or 2017. There were no construction/land loan charge-offs during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Loans to finance the construction of single-family homes, subdivisions and land loans are generally offered to builders in our primary market areas. Loans that are termed “speculative” are those where the builder does not have, at the time of loan origination, a signed contract with a buyer for the home or lot who has a commitment for permanent financing with either us or another lender. The buyer may be identified either during or after the construction period, with the risk that the builder may have to fund the debt service on the speculative loan along with real estate taxes and other carrying costs for the project for a significant period of time after completion of the project until a buyer is identified. The maximum loan-to-value ratio applicable to these loans is generally 100% of the actual cost of construction, provided that the loan-to-completed value does not exceed 80%, with approval required from the Chief Credit Officer (“CCO”) for loan-to-value ratios over 80%. In addition, a minimum of 20% verified equity is generally also required. Verified equity refers to cash equity invested in the project. Development plans are required from builders prior to committing to the loan. We require that builders maintain adequate title insurance and other appropriate insurance coverage, and, if applicable, appropriate environmental data report(s) that the land is free of hazardous or toxic waste. While maturity dates for residential construction loans are largely a function of the estimated construction period of the project and typically do not exceed one year, land loans generally are for 12 to 18 months. Substantially all of our residential construction loans have adjustable-rates of interest based on The Wall Street Journal prime rate. During the term of construction, the accumulated interest on the loan is either added to the principal of the loan through an interest reserve or billed monthly. At December 31, 2018, the LIP balance on construction/land loans was $86.4 million, including $6.2 million set aside for interest reserves. When these loans exhaust their original reserves set up at origination, no additional reserves are permitted unless the loan is re-analyzed and it is determined that the additional reserves are appropriate, based on the updated analysis. Construction loan proceeds are disbursed periodically as construction progresses and as inspections by our approved inspectors warrant. At December 31, 2018, our three largest construction/land loans, net of LIP, consisted of an $8.9 million commercial real estate construction loan, a $6.7 million multifamily construction loan, and a $5.7 million multifamily construction loan. All three loans will rollover to a permanent loan at the completion of the construction period and all three properties are located in King County.
Our residential construction loans to borrowers for one-to-four family, non-owner occupied residences typically are structured to be converted to fixed-rate permanent loans at the end of the construction phase with one closing for both the construction loan and the permanent financing. Prior to making a commitment to fund a construction loan, we require an appraisal of the post‑construction value of the project by an independent appraiser. During the construction phase, which typically lasts 12 to 18 months, an approved inspector or designated Bank employee makes periodic inspections of the construction site to certify construction has reached the stated percentage of completion. Typically, disbursements are made in monthly draws and interest-only payments are required. These loans are converted to fixed-rate permanent loans at the end of the construction phase. At December 31, 2018, there was one non-owner occupied construction loan of $1.7 million that will rollover to a permanent non-owner occupied one‑to‑four family residential loan in 2020.
We also make construction loans for commercial development projects. The projects include multifamily, retail, office/warehouse and office buildings. These loans typically have an interest-only payment phase during construction and generally convert to permanent financing when construction is complete. Disbursement of funds is at our sole discretion and is based on the progress of construction. The Bank uses an independent third party or Bank employee to conduct monthly inspections to certify that construction has reached the stated percentage of completion and that previous disbursements are reflected in the degree of work performed to date. Generally, the maximum loan-to-value ratio applicable to these loans is 90% of the actual cost of construction or 80% of the prospective value at completion. At December 31, 2018, $84.9 million of multifamily and commercial real estate construction loans will rollover to permanent loans with the Bank at the end of their construction period.
Land development loans are generally made to builders for preparation of a building site and do not include the construction of buildings on the property. The maximum loan-to-value ratio for these loans is 75%. Land non-development loans are generally for raw land where we do not finance the cost of preparing the site for building and are subject to a maximum loan‑to‑value ratio of 65%. 
Our construction/land loans are based upon estimates of costs in relation to values associated with the completed project. Construction/land lending involves additional risks when compared with permanent residential lending because funds are advanced upon the collateral for the project based on an estimate of costs that will produce a future value at completion. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, as well as the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation on real property, it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the completed project loan-to-value ratio. Changes in the demand, such as for new housing and higher than anticipated building costs may cause actual results to vary significantly from those estimated. For these reasons, this type of lending also typically involves higher loan principal amounts and is often concentrated with a small number of builders. These loans often involve the disbursement of funds with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property or obtain permanent take-out financing, rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest. If our appraisal of the value of a completed project proves to be overstated, we may have inadequate security for the repayment of the loan upon completion of construction of the project and may incur a loss. Because 
10

construction loans require active monitoring of the building process, including cost comparisons and on-site inspections, these loans are more difficult and costly to monitor. Increases in market rates of interest may have a more pronounced effect on construction loans by rapidly increasing the end-purchasers’ borrowing costs, thereby reducing the overall demand for the project. Properties under construction are often difficult to sell and typically must be completed in order to be successfully sold which also complicates the process of working out problem construction loans. This may require us to advance additional funds and/or contract with another builder to complete construction. Furthermore, in the case of speculative construction loans, there is the added risk associated with identifying an end-purchaser for the finished project. Land loans also pose additional risk because of the lack of income being produced by the property and the potential illiquid nature of the collateral. These risks can also be significantly influenced by supply and demand conditions.
Business Lending. Business loans totaled $30.5 million, or 2.7% of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2018. Business loans are generally secured by business equipment, accounts receivable, inventory or other property. Loan terms typically vary from one to five years. The interest rates on such loans are either fixed-rate or adjustable-rate. The interest rates for the adjustable‑rate loans are indexed to the prime rate published in The Wall Street Journal plus a margin. Our business lending policy includes credit file documentation and requires analysis of the borrower’s background, capacity to repay the loan, the adequacy of the borrower’s capital and collateral, as well as an evaluation of other conditions affecting the borrower. Analysis of the borrower’s past, present and future cash flows is also an important aspect of our credit analysis. We generally obtain personal guarantees on our business loans. The largest business loan had an outstanding balance of $9.8 million at December 31, 2018 and was performing according to its repayment terms. At December 31, 2018, we did not have any business loans delinquent in excess of 90 days or in nonaccrual status.
At December 31, 2018, the Bank’s aircraft loan portfolio had an outstanding balance of $11.1 million, or 36.3% of total business loans. We intend to grow this portfolio over the coming years. These loans are collateralized by new or used, single‑engine piston aircraft to light jets for business or personal use. We anticipate that our aircraft loans will range in size from $250,000 to $3.0 million with the primary focus of our underwriting guidelines on the asset value of the collateral rather than the ability of the borrower to repay the loan. The average loan size in our aircraft loan portfolio was $582,000 as of December 31, 2018.
Repayments of business loans are often dependent on the cash flows of the borrower, which may be unpredictable, and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Our business loans are originated primarily based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Credit support provided by the borrower for most of these loans and the probability of repayment is based on the liquidation of the pledged collateral and enforcement of a personal guarantee, if any. As a result, in the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers. The collateral securing business loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise, or may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business.
Consumer Lending. We offer a limited variety of consumer loans to our customers, consisting primarily of home equity loans and savings account loans. Generally, consumer loans have shorter terms to maturity and higher interest rates than one‑to‑four family residential loans. Consumer loans are offered with both fixed and adjustable interest rates and with varying terms. At December 31, 2018, consumer loans were $13.0 million, or 1.0% of the total loan portfolio.
At December 31, 2018, the largest component of the consumer loan portfolio consisted of home equity loans, primarily home equity lines of credit that totaled $11.2 million, or 86.1% of the total consumer loan portfolio. The home equity lines of credit include $4.7 million of equity lines of credit in first lien position and $6.5 million of second liens on residential properties. At December 31, 2018, unfunded commitments on our home equity lines of credit totaled $17.1 million. Home equity loans are made for purposes such as the improvement of residential properties, debt consolidation and education expenses. At origination, the loan-to-value ratio is generally 90% or less, when taking into account both the balance of the home equity loans and the first mortgage loan. Home equity loans are originated on a fixed-rate or adjustable-rate basis. The interest rate for the adjustable-rate second lien loans is indexed to the prime rate published in The Wall Street Journal and may include a margin. Home equity loans generally have a 10 to 30 year term, with a 10 year draw period, and either convert to principal and interest payments with no further draws or require a balloon payment due at maturity.
Consumer loans entail greater risk than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciating assets. In these cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance as a result of the greater likelihood of damage, loss or depreciation. The remaining deficiency often does not warrant further collection efforts against the borrower beyond obtaining a deficiency judgment. In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability and are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount 
11

that can be recovered on these loans. Home equity lines of credit have greater credit risk than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans because they are generally secured by mortgages subordinated to the existing first mortgage on the property that we may or may not hold in our portfolio. We do not have private mortgage insurance coverage on these loans. Adjustable-rate loans may experience a higher rate of default in a rising interest rate environment due to the increase in payment amounts when interest rates reset higher. If current economic conditions deteriorate for our borrowers and their home prices fall, we may also experience higher credit losses from this loan portfolio. For our home equity loans that are in a second lien position, it is unlikely that we will be successful in recovering our entire loan principal outstanding in the event of a default. At December 31, 2018, one consumer loan totaling $44,000 was in nonaccrual status, however, no consumer loans were delinquent more than 30 days. During the years ended December 31, 2018, and 2017, there were no consumer loans charged-off. In comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2016, consumer loans totaling $83,000 were charged off.

Loan Solicitation and Processing. The majority of our consumer and residential mortgage loan originations are generated through the Bank and from time to time through outside brokers and correspondent relationships we have established with select mortgage companies or other financial institutions. We originate multifamily, commercial real estate, construction/land and business loans primarily using the Bank’s loan officers, with referrals coming from builders, brokers and existing customers.
Upon receipt of a loan application from a prospective borrower, we obtain a credit report and other data to verify specific information relating to the loan applicant’s employment, income, and credit standing. All real estate loans requiring an appraisal are done by an independent third-party appraiser. All appraisers are approved by us, and their credentials are reviewed annually, as is the quality of their appraisals.
12

We use a multi-level approval matrix which establishes lending targets and tolerance levels depending on the loan type being approved. The matrix also sets minimum credit standards and approval limits for each of the loan types.
Lending Authority. The Directors’ Loan Committee consists of at least three members of the Board of Directors. The Directors’ Loan Committee recommends for approval by the Board of Directors exceptions to the aggregate loan limit to one borrower of 15% of total risk-based capital, or $21.0 million at December 31, 2018. The Board of Directors approves exceptions to such aggregate loan limit to one borrower up to 20% of total risk-based capital, or $28.0 million at December 31, 2018.

Officer Lending Authority. Individual signing authority has been delegated to two lending officers. Our Senior Credit Approval Officer (“SCAO”) has authority from the Board of Directors to approve loans and aggregate relationships up to and including $3.0 million. The Board of Directors has given our Chief Credit Officer (“CCO”) authority to approve credit to one borrower not to exceed our aggregate loan limit of 15% of total risk-based capital. 
Loan Originations, Servicing, Purchases, Sales and Repayments. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our total loan originations and purchases were $370.8 million, $430.7 million and $420.8 million, respectively. 
One-to-four family residential loans are generally originated in accordance with the guidelines established by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, with the exception of our special community development loans originated to satisfy compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. Our loans are underwritten by designated real estate loan underwriters internally in accordance with standards as provided by our Board-approved loan policy. We require title insurance on all loans and fire and casualty insurance on all secured loans and home equity loans where real estate serves as collateral. Flood insurance is also required on all secured loans when the real estate is located in a flood zone.
The following table shows total loans originated, purchased, repaid and other changes during the periods indicated.

Loan Origination and Other Fees. In some instances, we receive loan origination fees on real estate-related products. Loan fees generally represent a percentage of the principal amount of the loan and are paid by the borrower. The amount of fees charged to the borrower on one-to-four family residential loans and multifamily and commercial real estate loans can range from 0% to 2%. United States generally accepted accounting principles require that certain fees received, net of certain origination costs, be deferred and amortized over the contractual life of the loan. Net deferred fees or costs associated with loans that are prepaid or sold are recognized in income at the time of prepayment or sale. We had $1.2 million of net deferred loan fees at both December 31, 2018, and 2017.
Loan purchases generally include a premium, which is deferred and amortized into interest income with net deferred fees over the contractual life of the loan. During 2018, total premiums of $630,000, or 3.2% of the purchased principal, were paid on purchased loans. In comparison, premiums of $1.8 million, or 2.3% of the purchased principal were paid on purchased loans during 2017.
One-to-four family residential and consumer loans are generally originated without a prepayment penalty. The majority of our multifamily and commercial real estate loans, however, have prepayment penalties associated with the loans. Most of the multifamily and commercial real estate loan originations with interest rates fixed for the first five years will adjust thereafter and have a prepayment penalty of 2% - 3% of the principal balance in year one, with decreasing penalties in subsequent years. Longer initial fixed rate terms generally have correspondingly longer prepayment penalty periods.
Asset Quality
As of December 31, 2018, we had two owner occupied one-to-four family residential loans totaling $495,000 and one commercial real estate loan of $326,000 past due 30 days or more. These loans represented 0.08% of total loans, net of LIP. Subsequent to December 31, 2018, the $326,000 nonperforming commercial real estate loan was paid in full. We generally assess late fees or penalty charges on delinquent loans of up to 5.0% of the monthly payment. The borrower is given up to a 15 day grace period from the due date to make the loan payment.
We handle collection procedures internally or with the assistance of outside legal counsel. Late charges are incurred when the loan exceeds 10 to 15 days past due depending upon the loan product. When a delinquent loan is identified, corrective action takes place immediately. The first course of action is to determine the cause of the delinquency and seek cooperation from the borrower in resolving the issue. Additional corrective action, if required, will vary depending on the borrower, the collateral, if any, and whether the loan requires specific handling procedures as required by the Washington State Deed of Trust Act.

If the borrower is chronically delinquent and all reasonable means of obtaining payments have been exhausted, we will seek to foreclose on the collateral securing the loan according to the terms of the security instrument and applicable law. The following table shows our delinquent loans by the type of loan, net of LIP, and the number of days delinquent at December 31, 2018:

 | Loans Delinquent | Total 
 | 30-59 Days | 60-89 Days | | 90 Days and Greater | Delinquent Loans

Total | 1 | | $ | 223 | | 2 | | | $ | 598 | | — | | $ | — | 3 | $ | 821


Construction/land, commercial real estate, and multifamily loans generally have larger individual loan amounts that have a greater single impact on asset quality in the event of delinquency or default. We continue to monitor our loan portfolio and believe additions to nonperforming loans, charge-offs, provisions for loan losses, and/or OREO are possible in the future, particularly if the housing market and other economic conditions do not continue to improve.

_______
(1) These loans are also included in the appropriate loan category above under the caption: “Loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis.”
Nonperforming Loans. When a loan becomes 90 days past due, we generally place the loan on nonaccrual status unless the credit is well secured and in the process of collection. Loans may be placed on nonaccrual status prior to being 90 days past due if there is an identified problem such as an impending foreclosure or bankruptcy or if the borrower is unable to meet their scheduled payment obligations. Our nonperforming loans increased by $573,000, or 320.1%, at December 31, 2018, as compared to December 31, 2017, with the addition of two nonperforming loans during 2018. Subsequent to December 31, 2018, a $326,000 nonperforming commercial loan was paid in full. During 2018, there were no charge offs to nonperforming loans. 

Other Real Estate Owned. Real estate acquired by us as a result of foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure is classified as OREO until it is sold. When the property is acquired, it is recorded at the lower of its cost or fair market value of the property, less selling costs. We had $483,000 of OREO at both December 31, 2018 and 2017 comprised of undeveloped lots. Our special assets department’s primary focus is the prompt and effective management of our troubled, nonperforming assets, and expediting their disposition to minimize any potential losses. During 2018 and 2017, we did not foreclose or accept deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure on any loans. In the future, we may experience foreclosure, deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, and short sale activity while we work with our nonperforming loan customers to minimize our loss exposure.

Because of our structure, we believe we are able to make decisions regarding offers on OREO and the real estate underlying our nonperforming loans very quickly compared to larger institutions where decisions could take six to twelve months. This distinction has historically worked to our benefit in reducing our nonperforming assets and disposing of OREO. 
Troubled Debt Restructured Loans. We account for certain loan modifications or restructurings as TDRs. In general, the modification or restructuring of a debt is considered a TDR if, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower’s financial difficulties, we grant a concession to the borrower that we would not otherwise consider. These loans are all considered to be impaired loans. At December 31, 2018, we had $9.4 million in TDRs as compared to $17.8 million at December 31, 2017.

Prior to 2012, we utilized a strategy for a limited number of our lending relationships of establishing an “A” and “B” note structure. We created an “A” note representing a reduced principal balance expected to be fully collected and at a debt service level and loan-to-value ratio acceptable to us. The “A” note was classified as a performing TDR as long as the borrower continued to perform in accordance with the note terms. The “B” note represented the amount of the principal reduction portion of the original note and was immediately charged-off. The “B” note is held by the Bank and when the “A” note is paid off, the Bank may proceed with collection efforts on the “B” note. During 2017, due to the improved financial condition of the borrowers holding “A” and “B” notes, and the increased market value of the underlying properties, the Bank issued revised notes that allowed for recovery of the “B” note principal, and in some cases, recognition of interest income as payments were made. In 2018, the remaining “B” notes on these agreements were paid off, resulting in recoveries of $4.3 million of previously charged off balances. At December 31, 2018, the balance of TDRs included $560,000 in remaining “A” notes. 
The largest TDR relationship at December 31, 2018 totaled $1.4 million and was comprised of one‑to‑four family residential loans secured by rental properties located in Pierce County. At December 31, 2018, there was no LIP in connection with our TDRs. For additional information regarding our TDRs, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report.

Classified Assets. Federal regulations provide for the classification of lower quality loans and other assets as substandard, doubtful or loss. An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and payment capacity of the borrower or of any collateral pledged. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values. Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. 
When we classify problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, we may establish a specific allowance in an amount we deem prudent. General allowances represent loss allowances that have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities, but unlike specific allowances, have not been specifically allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as a loss, it is required to charge-off those assets in the period in which they are deemed uncollectible. Our determinations as to the classification of our assets and the amount of our valuation allowances are subject to review by the FDIC and the DFI that can order the establishment of additional loss allowances or the charge-off of specific loans against established loss reserves. Assets that do not currently expose us to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated as special mention. At December 31, 2018, special mention loans totaled $2.5 million.

In connection with the filing of periodic reports with the FDIC and in accordance with our loan policy, we regularly review the problem loans in our portfolio to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. The decrease in our classified loans during the year ended December 31, 2018 was a result of loan repayments as well as our efforts to work with our borrowers to bring their loans current when possible or restructure the loan when appropriate. During 2018, we continued our aggressive approach to reduce nonperforming assets and improve asset quality.

Classified loans, net of LIP, consisting solely of substandard loans, were as follows at the dates indicated:

 | (In thousands)
One-to-four family residential | $ | 919 | | | $ | 673 
Commercial real estate | 326 | | | 555 | 
Consumer | 44 | | | 52 | 
Total classified loans | $ | 1,289 | | | $ | 1,280


With the exception of these classified loans, of which $752,000 were accounted for as nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2018, management is not aware of any loans as of December 31, 2018, where the known credit problems of the borrower would cause us to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with their present loan repayment terms and which may result in the future inclusion of such loans in the nonperforming loan categories.

Allowance for Loan Losses. Management recognizes that loan losses may occur over the life of a loan and that the ALLL must be maintained at a level necessary to absorb specific losses on impaired loans and probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Our methodology for analyzing the ALLL consists of two components: general and specific allowances. The general allowance is determined by applying factors to our various groups of loans. Management considers factors such as charge-off history, the prevailing economy, the borrower’s ability to repay, the regulatory environment, competition, geographic and loan type concentrations, policy and underwriting standards, nature and volume of the loan portfolio, managements’ experience level, our loan review and grading systems, the value of underlying collateral, and the level of problem loans in assessing the ALLL. The specific allowance component is created when management believes that the collectability of a specific loan has been impaired and a loss is probable. The specific reserves are computed using current appraisals, listed sales prices and other available information, less costs to complete, if any, and costs to sell the property. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available or as future events differ from predictions. In addition, specific reserves may be created upon a loan’s restructuring, based on a discounted cash flow analysis comparing the present value of the anticipated repayments under the restructured terms to the outstanding principal balance of the loan.

Quarterly, our Board of Directors’ Internal Asset Review Committee reviews and recommends approval of the allowance for loan losses and any provision or recapture of provision for loan losses, and the full Board of Directors approves the provision or recapture after considering the Committee’s recommendation. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses which is charged against current period earnings. If the analysis of our loan portfolio indicates the risk of loss is less than the balance of the ALLL, a recapture of provision of loan loss is added to current period earnings. 
For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a $4.0 million recapture of provision for loan losses to our ALLL, as compared to a $400,000 recapture of provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2017, and a provision for loan losses of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The recapture of provision for loan losses in 2018 was primarily a result of the $4.5 million in net recoveries received on previously charged-off loans partially offset by the provision necessary to support the increase in total loans, net LIP, of $34.7 million. The quality of our loan portfolio was stable, with a significant decrease in TDRs and a small increase in delinquent and nonperforming loans, due primarily to our efforts working with our borrowers to bring their loan payments current whenever possible. The ALLL was $13.3 million, or 1.29% of total loans, net of LIP, at December 31, 2018, as compared to $12.9 million, or 1.28% at December 31, 2017. The level of the ALLL is based on estimates and the ultimate losses may vary from the estimates. Management reviews the adequacy of the ALLL on a quarterly basis.

A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due, according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, market conditions, rent rolls, and the borrower’s and guarantor’s, if any, financial strength. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and shortfalls on a case‑by‑case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment record and the amounts of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Loans are evaluated for impairment on a loan-by-loan basis. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, impaired loans were $10.1 million and $18.0 million, respectively. At December 31, 2018, there was no LIP in connection with our impaired loans.

We believe that the ALLL as of December 31, 2018 was adequate to absorb the probable and inherent losses in the loan portfolio at that date. While we believe the estimates and assumptions used in our determination of the adequacy of the ALLL are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will be proven correct in the future, or that the actual amount of future provisions will not exceed the amount of past provisions, or that any increased provisions that may be required will not adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Future additions to the ALLL may become necessary based upon changing economic conditions, the level of problem loans, business conditions, credit concentrations, increased loan balances or changes in the underlying collateral of the loan portfolio. In addition, the determination of the amount of the ALLL is subject to review by bank regulators as part of the routine examination process that may result in the establishment of additional loss reserves or the charge-off of specific loans against established loss reserves based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination. 
The following table sets forth an analysis of our ALLL at the dates and for the periods indicated.

Investment Activities
General. Under Washington State law, commercial banks are permitted to invest in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various federal agencies, certain certificates of deposit of insured banks and savings institutions, banker’s acceptances, repurchase agreements, federal funds, commercial paper, investment grade corporate debt securities, and obligations of states and their political sub-divisions.
The Investment, Asset/Liability Committee (“ALCO”), consisting of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Controller of First Financial Northwest Bank, other members of management and the Board of Directors, has the authority and responsibility to administer our investment policy, monitor portfolio strategies, and recommend appropriate changes to policy and strategies to the Board of Directors. On a monthly basis, management reports to the Board a summary of investment holdings with respective market values and all purchases and sales of investment securities. The Chief Financial Officer has the primary responsibility for the management of the investment portfolio and considers various factors when making decisions, including the marketability, maturity, liquidity, and tax consequences of proposed investments. The maturity structure of investments will be affected by various market conditions, including the current and anticipated slope of the yield curve, the level of interest rates, the trend of new deposit inflows, and the anticipated demand for funds via deposit withdrawals and loan originations and purchases.
The general objectives of the investment portfolio are to provide liquidity when loan demand is high, to assist in maintaining earnings when loan demand is low, and to maximize earnings while satisfactorily managing risk, including credit risk, reinvestment risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk. 
19

At December 31, 2018, our investment portfolio consisted principally of mortgage-backed securities, municipal bonds, U.S. government agency obligations, and corporate bonds. From time to time, investment levels may increase or decrease depending upon yields available on investment opportunities and management’s projected demand for funds for loan originations, net deposit flows, and other activities. At December 31, 2018, we did not hold securities of any single issuer (other than government-sponsored entities) that exceeded 10% of our shareholders’ equity. We currently do not have any investments held to maturity or for trading.
Other than our utilization of interest rate swaps, we do not currently participate in other hedging programs, stand-alone contracts for interest rate caps or floors or other activities involving the use of off-balance sheet derivative financial instruments, and have no present intention to do so. As of December 31, 2018, we had one interest rate swap with an aggregate notional amount of $50.0 million and a fair value of $1.7 million. For additional information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors -“If interest rate swaps we entered into prove ineffective, it could result in volatility in our operating results, including potential loses, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Asset and Liability Management”, and Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report.
Mortgage-Backed Securities. The mortgage-backed securities in our portfolio were primarily comprised of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae issued mortgage-backed securities. These issuers guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest in the event of default. In addition, at December 31, 2018, our mortgage-backed securities included $9.0 million of other “private label” mortgage-backed securities. The mortgage-backed securities portfolio had a weighted-average yield of 3.20% at December 31, 2018.
U.S. Government Agency Obligations. The agency securities in our portfolio were comprised of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) and FHLB agency securities. These issuers guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest in the event of default. At December 31, 2018, the portfolio of government agency securities had a weighted-average yield of 3.92%.
The guarantees of the SBA, as a U.S. government agency and Ginnie Mae, as part of a U.S. government agency are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks are U.S. government-sponsored entities. Although their guarantees are not backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, they may borrow from the U.S. Treasury, which has taken other steps to ensure these U.S. government-sponsored entities can fulfill their financial obligations.
Corporate Bonds. The corporate bond portfolio was primarily comprised of variable rate securities issued by various financial institutions. At December 31, 2018, the corporate bond portfolio had a weighted-average yield of 6.42%.
Municipal Bonds. The municipal bond portfolio is comprised of tax-exempt municipal bonds. The pre-tax weighted-average yield on the municipal bond portfolio was 2.82% at December 31, 2018. 
Federal Home Loan Bank Stock. As a member of the FHLB Des Moines, we are required to own capital stock. The required amount of capital stock is based on a percentage of our previous year-end assets and our outstanding FHLB advances. The redemption of any excess stock we hold is at the discretion of the FHLB Des Moines. During 2018, our FHLB stock holdings decreased by $2.6 million, primarily as a result of the $69.5 million decrease in our FHLB advances during 2018. The carrying value of our FHLB stock totaled $7.3 million at December 31, 2018. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we received FHLB cash dividends of $458,000 and $296,000, respectively.

At December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 there were no investments held to maturity.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, gross proceeds from the call, maturity and sale of investments was $17.2 million, with net realized losses of $20,000.
Management reviews investment securities on an ongoing basis for the presence of other than temporary impairment (“OTTI”) or permanent impairment, taking into consideration current market conditions, fair value in relationship to cost, extent and nature of the change in fair value, issuer rating changes and trends, whether management intends to sell a security or if it is likely that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis of the investment, which may be maturity, and other factors. For debt securities, if management intends to sell the security or it is likely that we will be required to sell the security before recovering its cost basis, the entire impairment loss would be recognized in earnings as an OTTI. If management does not intend to sell the security and it is not likely that we will be required to sell the security, but management does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security, only the portion of the impairment loss representing credit losses would be recognized in earnings. The credit loss on a security is measured as the difference between the amortized cost basis and the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected. Projected cash flows are discounted by the original or current effective interest rate, depending on the nature of the security being measured for potential OTTI. The remaining impairment related to all other factors, the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and fair value, is recognized as a charge to other comprehensive income (loss). Impairment losses related to all other factors are presented as separate categories within other comprehensive income (loss). There were no losses related to OTTI at December 31, 2018 and 2017. For additional information regarding our investments, see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report.

Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds
General. Deposits and loan repayments are the major sources of our funds for lending and other investment purposes. Scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are influenced significantly by general interest rates and market conditions. Borrowings from the FHLB are used to supplement the availability of funds from other sources and also as a source of term funds to assist in the management of interest rate risk.
Our deposit composition reflects a mixture of various deposit products. We rely on marketing activities, customer service, and the availability of a broad range of products and services to attract and retain customer deposits. 
Deposits. We offer a competitive range of deposit products within our market area, including noninterest bearing accounts, interest-bearing demand accounts, money market deposit accounts, statement savings accounts, and certificates of deposit. Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time periods the funds must remain on deposit, and the interest rate, among other factors. In determining the terms of our deposit accounts, we consider the development of long-term profitable customer relationships, current market interest rates, current maturity structures, deposit mix, our customer preferences, and the profitability of acquiring customer deposits compared to alternative funding sources. As part of our strategy to shift our deposit mix to lower cost funds, we continued to better align our pricing with competitors in our local market to meet our goals. To supplement local deposits, funds are also generated through national brokered certificates of deposit. At December 31, 2018, $97.8 million, or 10.4% of total deposits were brokered certificates of deposit, with remaining maturities ranging from one month to five years. These funds cannot be withdrawn early except in the case of the death or adjudication of incompetence of the depositor. However, the Bank has a quarterly call option six months after issuance on $69.3 million of these brokered deposits that allows the Bank to close the certificate of deposit and return the deposit to the customer if the Bank determines it is in its best interest to do so. The long term nature of these brokered deposits, along with the enhanced features of these deposits as compared to retail certificates of deposit, assists us in our interest rate risk management efforts.
The following table sets forth our total deposit activity for the periods indicated.

At December 31, 2018, deposits totaled $939.0 million. We had $313.5 million of jumbo (greater than or equal to $100,000) certificates of deposit, which were 33.4% of total deposits at December 31, 2018. Of these jumbo deposits, $129.3 million were greater than or equal to $250,000. At that date, included in the jumbo certificates of deposit, were public funds totaling $28.5 million, or 3.0% of total deposits, of which $26.9 million was in excess of the $250,000 standard FDIC insurance coverage. Under Washington State law, in order to participate in the public funds program, we are required to pledge eligible securities of a minimum of 50% of the public deposits in excess of $250,000.

Borrowings. Customer deposits are the primary source of funds for our lending and investment activities. We use advances from the FHLB and to a lesser extent federal funds (“Fed Funds”) purchased to supplement our supply of lendable funds, to meet short-term deposit withdrawal requirements and to provide longer term funding to better match the duration of selected loan and investment maturities. In addition, at December 31, 2018 we had supplemental funding sources of $91.2 million available at the FRB and $35.0 million available between two other financial institutions.
25

As a member of the FHLB, we are required to own capital stock in the FHLB and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of that stock and certain of our mortgage loans, provided that certain creditworthiness standards have been met. Advances are individually made under various terms pursuant to several different credit programs, each with its own interest rate and range of maturities. Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of advances are based on the financial condition of the member institution and the adequacy of collateral pledged to secure the credit. We maintain a credit facility with the FHLB that provides for immediately available advances, subject to acceptable collateral. At December 31, 2018, our remaining FHLB credit capacity was $408.3 million and outstanding advances from the FHLB totaled $146.5 million.
The following table sets forth information regarding FHLB advances at the end of and during the periods indicated. The table includes both long- and short-term borrowings.

Subsidiaries and Other Activities
First Financial Northwest, Inc. First Financial Northwest has two wholly-owned subsidiaries, First Financial Northwest Bank and First Financial Diversified Corporation. First Financial Diversified Corporation currently holds a loan portfolio of one‑to-four family residential, commercial real estate, and consumer loans. At December 31, 2018, First Financial Diversified’s net loans receivable of $1.8 million represented less than one percent of the Company’s loan portfolio.
First Financial Northwest Bank. First Financial Northwest Bank is a community-based commercial bank. The Bank primarily serves the greater Puget Sound region of King and to a lesser extent, Pierce, Snohomish and Kitsap Counties, Washington through our full-service banking office in Renton, Washington and nine additional branches in King and Snohomish Counties, Washington. We are in the business of attracting deposits from the public and utilizing those deposits to originate loans.
Competition
The Bank operates in the highly competitive Puget Sound region of Western Washington. We face competition in originating loans and attracting deposits within our geographic market area. The competitive environment is impacted by changes in the regulatory environment, technology and product delivery systems as well as consolidation in the industry creating larger, more diversified competitors. We compete by striving to consistently deliver high-quality personal service to our customers seeking to achieve a high level of customer satisfaction.
The Bank attracts deposits primarily through its branch office system. The competition is primarily from commercial banks, savings institutions and credit unions in the same geographic area. Based on the most current FDIC market share data dated June 30, 2018, the top five banks in the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue metropolitan statistical area (comprised of Bank of America, Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase, US Bancorp and KeyBank) controlled 71% of the deposit market. In addition to the FDIC insured competitors, credit unions, insurance companies, brokerage firms, and more recently, financial technology (or “FinTech”) companies also compete for consumer deposit relationships. According to FDIC statistical market data, the Bank’s share of aggregate deposits in the market area is less than 1%.    Our competition for loans comes principally from commercial banks, mortgage brokers, thrift institutions, credit unions, finance companies and FinTech companies. Several other financial institutions compete with us for banking business in our market area. Many of our competitors have substantially more resources than the Bank, some of which are able to offer a broader range of services, such as trust departments and enhanced retail services. Among the advantages of some of these competitors are their ability to make larger loans, initiate extensive advertising campaigns, access lower cost funding sources, and allocate their investable assets in regions of highest yield and demand. The challenges posed by such large competitors may impact our ability to originate loans, secure low cost deposits, and establish product pricing levels that support our net interest margin goals that may limit our future growth and earnings potential.

Employees
At December 31, 2018, we had 156 full-time employees. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining group. We consider our employee relations to be good.
How We Are Regulated
The following is a brief description of certain laws and regulations that are applicable to First Financial Northwest and First Financial Northwest Bank. On March 31, 2015, First Financial Northwest converted from a registered savings and loan holding company to a bank holding company. As a bank holding company, First Financial Northwest is subject to examination and supervision by, and is required to file certain reports with, the FRB. First Financial Northwest also is subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC under the federal securities laws. First Financial Northwest Bank, which changed its charter from a Washington-chartered savings bank to a Washington-chartered commercial bank effective on February 11, 2016, is subject to regulation and oversight by the DFI, the applicable provisions of Washington law and by the regulations of the DFI adopted thereunder. First Financial Northwest Bank also is subject to regulation and examination by the FDIC, which insures its deposits to the maximum extent permitted by law.
The laws and regulations affecting depository institutions and their holding companies have changed significantly, particularly in connection with the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. Among other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) as an independent bureau of the Federal Reserve. The CFPB assumed responsibility for the implementation of the federal financial consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations and has authority to impose new requirements. 
In May 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the “EGRRCPA”), was enacted to modify or remove certain financial reform rules and regulations, including some of those implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act. While the ECRRCPA maintains most of the regulatory structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act, it amends certain aspects of the regulatory framework for small depository institutions with assets of less than $10 billion and for large banks with assets of more than $50 billion. 
The EGRRCPA, among other matters, expands the definition of qualified mortgages which may be held by a financial institution and simplifies the regulatory capital rules for financial institutions and their holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion by instructing the federal banking regulators to establish a single “Community Bank Leverage Ratio” of between 8 and 10 percent. Any qualifying depository institution or its holding company that exceeds the “community bank leverage ratio” will be considered to have met generally applicable leverage and risk-based regulatory capital requirements and any qualifying depository institution that exceeds the new ratio will be considered to be “well capitalized” under the prompt corrective action rules. 
The EGRRCPA also expands the category of holding companies that may rely on the Federal Reserve’s “Small Bank Holding Company and Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement” by raising the maximum amount of assets a qualifying holding company may have from $1 billion to $3 billion. A major result of this change is to exclude most such holding companies from the minimum capital requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Federal Reserve made this change effective August 30, 2018. In addition, the Act includes regulatory relief for community banks regarding regulatory examination cycles, call reports, mortgage disclosures and risk weights for certain high-risk commercial real estate loans.
It is difficult at this time to predict when or how any new standards under the EGRRCPA will ultimately be applied to us or what specific impact that Act and the forthcoming implementing rules and regulations will have.
In addition, the laws and regulations governing us may be amended from time to time by the relevant legislative bodies and regulators. Any such legislative action or regulatory changes in the future could adversely affect us. We cannot predict whether any such changes may occur.
Regulation and Supervision of First Financial Northwest Bank
General. As a state-chartered commercial bank, First Financial Northwest Bank is subject to applicable provisions of Washington state law and regulations of the DFI in addition to federal law and regulations of the FDIC applicable to state banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve System. State law and regulations govern First Financial Northwest Bank’s ability to take deposits and pay interest, to make loans on or invest in residential and other real estate, to make consumer loans, to invest in securities, to offer various banking services to its customers and to establish branch offices. Under state law, commercial banks 
27

in Washington also generally have all of the powers that federal commercial banks have under federal laws and regulations. First Financial Northwest Bank is subject to periodic examination by and reporting requirements of the DFI.
Insurance of Accounts and Regulation by the FDIC. First Financial Northwest Bank’s deposits are insured up to $250,000 per separately insured deposit ownership right or category by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC. As insurer, the FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of, and to require reporting by, FDIC-insured institutions. The FDIC also may prohibit any insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the deposit insurance fund. The FDIC also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against commercial institutions and may terminate the deposit insurance if it determines that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition.
Under the FDIC’s rules, the assessment base for a bank is equal to its total average consolidated assets less average tangible equity capital. Currently, the FDIC’s base assessment rates are 3 to 30 basis points and are subject to certain adjustments. For institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, rates are determined based on supervisory ratings and certain financial ratios. No institution may pay a dividend if it is in default on its federal deposit insurance assessment. 
In addition, federally insured institutions are required to pay a Financing Corporation (“FICO”) assessment in order to fund the interest on bonds issued to resolve thrift failures in the 1980s. For the quarter ended December 31, 2018, the FICO assessment rate was 0.32 basis points (annualized) of the assessment base, computed on assets. These assessments will continue until the remaining bonds have matured in September 2019. For 2018, the Bank incurred approximately $502,000 in FDIC and FICO assessment expense.
The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution, including First Financial Northwest Bank, if it determines after a hearing that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or any condition imposed by an agreement with the FDIC. It also may suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance if the institution has no tangible capital. If insurance of accounts is terminated, the accounts at the institution at the time of the termination, less subsequent withdrawals, shall continue to be insured for a period of six months to two years, as determined by the FDIC. We are not aware of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of First Financial Northwest Bank’s deposit insurance.
A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. There can be no prediction as to what changes in insurance assessment rates may be made in the future.
Standards for Safety and Soundness. The federal banking regulatory agencies have prescribed, by regulation, guidelines for all insured depository institutions relating to: internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. Each insured depository institution must implement a comprehensive written information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards appropriate to the institution’s size and complexity and the nature and scope of its activities. The information security program also must be designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, protect against any unanticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information, protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer and ensure the proper disposal of customer and consumer information. Each insured depository institution must also develop and implement a risk-based response program to address incidents of unauthorized access to customer information in customer information systems. If the FDIC determines that an institution fails to meet any of these guidelines, it may require an institution to submit to the FDIC an acceptable plan to achieve compliance. We are not aware of any conditions relating to these safety and soundness standards that would require submission of a plan of compliance by First Financial Northwest Bank.
Capital Requirements. Federally insured financial institutions, such as First Financial Northwest Bank, and their holding companies, are required to maintain a minimum level of regulatory capital. 
The Federal Reserve and the FDIC adopted new capital changes effective January 1, 2015, (with some changes phased in over several years), First Financial Northwest Bank became subject to new capital regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, which establish minimum required ratios for common equity Tier 1 capital (“CET1”), Tier 1 capital and total capital, and the leverage ratio; set out risk-weights for assets and certain off-balance sheet items for purposes of the risk-based capital ratios, require an additional capital conservation buffer over the minimum risk-based ratios’ and define what qualifies as capital for purposes of meeting the capital requirements. These regulations implement the regulatory capital reforms required by the 
28

Dodd-Frank Act and the “Basel III” requirements. First Financial Northwest was also subject to these regulations until August 30, 2018, pursuant to the EGRRCPA as discussed above. 
Under the capital regulations, the minimum capital ratios are: (1) a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets; (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% of risk-weighted assets; (3) a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% of risk-weighted assets; and (4) a leverage ratio (the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total adjusted assets) of 4.0%. CET1 generally consists of common stock, retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) unless an institution has elected to exclude AOCI from regulatory capital, and certain minority interests, all subject to applicable regulatory adjustments and deductions. Tier 1 capital generally consists of CET1 and noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital generally consists of other preferred stock and subordinated debt meeting certain conditions plus an amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses up to 1.25% of assets. Total capital is the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital.
There are a number of changes in what constitutes regulatory capital compared to the rules in effect prior to January 1, 2015, some of which are subject to transition periods. These changes include the phasing-out of certain instruments as qualifying capital and eliminate or significantly reduce the use of hybrid capital instruments, especially trust preferred securities, as regulatory capital. Mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets over designated percentages of CET1 are deducted from capital. In addition, Tier 1 capital includes AOCI, which includes all unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities. However, because of our asset size, we were eligible for the one-time option of permanently opting out of the inclusion of unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities in our capital calculations. We elected this option in the first quarter of 2015.
For purposes of determining risk-based capital, assets and certain off-balance sheet items are risk-weighted from 0% to 1,250%, depending on the risk characteristics of the asset or item. The new regulations make certain changes in the risk-weighting of assets to better reflect credit risk and other risk exposure compared to the earlier capital rules. These include a 150% risk weight (up from 100%) for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans and for non‑residential mortgage loans that are 90 days past due or otherwise in nonaccrual status; and a 20% (up from 0%) credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable (currently set at 0%). Mortgage servicing and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital were proposed to increase to 250% in 2018, however they remained at 100%.
In addition to the minimum CET1, Tier 1, and total capital ratios, the capital regulations require a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET1 capital greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses. The phase-in of the capital conservation buffer requirement began on January 1, 2016 when a buffer greater than 0.625% of risk-weighted assets was required, which increased each year where the buffer requirement is fully implemented as of January 1, 2019.

To be considered “well capitalized,” a depository institution must have a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, a CET1 capital ratio of at least 6.5% and a leverage ratio of at least 5%, and not be subject to an individualized order, directive or agreement under which its primary federal banking regulator requires it to maintain a specific capital level. As of December 31, 2018, First Financial Northwest Bank met the requirements to be “well capitalized” and met the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer requirement.

The table below sets forth First Financial Northwest Bank’s capital position at December 31, 2018 and 2017, based on FDIC thresholds to be well-capitalized. 

 | December 31,

Excess | $ | 44,699 | | | 4.68 | % | | $ | 36,785 | | 3.77 | %

The FDIC also has authority to establish individual minimum capital requirements in appropriate cases upon a determination that an institution’s capital level is or may become inadequate in light of particular risks or circumstances. Management of First Financial Northwest Bank believes that, under the current regulations, First Financial Northwest Bank will continue to meet its minimum capital requirements in the foreseeable future.
For a complete description of First Financial Northwest Bank’s required and actual capital levels on December 31, 2018, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board has adopted a new accounting standard for US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles that will be effective for us for our first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2019. This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, requires FDIC-insured institutions and their holding companies (banking organizations) to recognize credit losses expected over the life of certain financial assets. CECL covers a broader range of assets than the current method of recognizing credit losses and generally results in earlier recognition of credit losses. Upon adoption of CECL, a banking organization must record a one-time adjustment to its credit loss allowances as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of credit loss allowances under the current methodology and the amount required under CECL. For a banking organization, implementation of CECL is generally likely to reduce retained earnings, and to affect other items, in a manner that reduces its regulatory capital.
The federal banking regulators (the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the FDIC) have adopted a rule that gives a banking organization the option to phase in over a three-year period the day-one adverse effects of CECL on its regulatory capital.
Prompt Corrective Action. Federal statutes establish a supervisory framework for FDIC-insured institutions based on five capital categories:  well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. An institution’s category depends upon where its capital levels are in relation to relevant capital measures. The well-capitalized category is described above. An institution that is not well capitalized is subject to certain restrictions on brokered deposits, including restrictions on the rates it can offer on its deposits, generally. To be considered adequately capitalized, an 
30

institution must have the minimum capital ratios described above. Any institution which is neither well capitalized nor adequately capitalized is considered undercapitalized. 
Undercapitalized institutions are subject to certain prompt corrective action requirements, regulatory controls and restrictions which become more extensive as an institution becomes more severely undercapitalized. Failure by First Financial Northwest Bank to comply with applicable capital requirements would, if unremedied, result in progressively more severe restrictions on its activities and lead to enforcement actions, including, but not limited to, the issuance of a capital directive to ensure the maintenance of required capital levels and, ultimately, the appointment of the FDIC as receiver or conservator. Banking regulators will take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. Additionally, approval of any regulatory application filed for their review may be dependent on compliance with capital requirements.
At December 31, 2018, First Financial Northwest Bank was categorized as “well capitalized” under the prompt corrective action regulations of the FDIC. For additional information, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report.
Federal Home Loan Bank System. First Financial Northwest Bank is a member of the FHLB of Des Moines, one of 11 regional FHLBs that administer the home financing credit function of savings institutions. The FHLBs are subject to the oversight of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (“FHFA”) and each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. The FHLBs are funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB System and make loans or advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors of the FHLB, which are subject to the oversight of the FHFA. All advances from the FHLB are required to be fully secured by sufficient collateral as determined by the FHLB. In addition, all long-term advances are required to provide funds for residential home financing. See “Business – Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds – Borrowings.”
At December 31, 2018, the Bank held $7.3 million in FHLB of Des Moines stock that was in compliance with the holding requirements. The Bank purchased 2,079 shares of additional stock in March 2018 as a result of the increase in assets as of December 31, 2017. In addition, activity stock was purchased and sold throughout 2018 in response to increases or payoffs to our outstanding advances. At December 31, 2018, the Bank had a net decrease in activity stock held of 27,800 shares for the year. The FHLB pays dividends quarterly, and First Financial Northwest Bank received $458,000 in dividends during the year ended December 31, 2018.
The FHLBs continue to contribute to low- and moderately-priced housing programs through direct loans or interest subsidies on advances targeted for community investment and low- and moderate-income housing projects. These contributions have adversely affected the level of FHLB dividends paid and could continue to do so in the future. These contributions could also have an adverse effect on the value of FHLB of Des Moines stock in the future. A reduction in value of First Financial Northwest Bank’s FHLB of Des Moines stock may result in a decrease in net income and possibly capital.
Commercial Real Estate Lending Concentrations. The federal banking agencies have issued guidance on sound risk management practices for concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The particular focus is on exposure to commercial real estate loans that are dependent on the cash flow from the real estate held as collateral and that are likely to be sensitive to conditions in the commercial real estate market (as opposed to real estate collateral held as a secondary source of repayment or as an abundance of caution). The purpose of the guidance is not to limit a bank’s commercial real estate lending but to guide banks in developing risk management practices and capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of real estate concentrations. The guidance directs the FDIC and other federal bank regulatory agencies to focus their supervisory resources on institutions that may have significant commercial real estate loan concentration risk. A bank that has experienced rapid growth in commercial real estate lending, has notable exposure to a specific type of commercial real estate loan, or is approaching or exceeding the following supervisory criteria may be identified for further supervisory analysis with respect to real estate concentration risk:

• | Total reported loans for construction, land development and other land represent 100% or more of the bank’s total regulatory capital; or


• | Total commercial real estate loans (as defined in the guidance) represent 300% or more of the bank’s total regulatory capital and the outstanding balance of the bank’s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months.

The guidance provides that the strength of an institution’s lending and risk management practices with respect to such concentrations will be taken into account in supervisory guidance on evaluation of capital adequacy. As of December 31, 2018, First Financial Northwest Bank’s aggregate recorded loan balances for construction, land development and land loans were 81.9% 
31

of regulatory capital. In addition, at December 31, 2018, First Financial Northwest Bank’s loans on commercial real estate, as defined by the FDIC, were 451.8% of regulatory capital.
Activities and Investments of Insured State-Chartered Financial Institutions. Federal law generally limits the activities and equity investments of FDIC-insured, state-chartered banks to those that are permissible for national banks. An insured state bank is not prohibited from, among other things, (1) acquiring or retaining a majority interest in a subsidiary, (2) investing as a limited partner in a partnership the sole purpose of which is direct or indirect investment in the acquisition, rehabilitation or new construction of a qualified housing project, provided that such limited partnership investments may not exceed 2% of the bank’s total assets, (3) acquiring up to 10% of the voting stock of a company that solely provides or reinsures directors’, trustees’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage or bankers’ blanket bond group insurance coverage for insured depository institutions and (4) acquiring or retaining the voting shares of a depository institution owned by another FDIC-insured institution if certain requirements are met.
Washington State has enacted a law regarding financial institution parity. Primarily, the law affords Washington state‑chartered commercial banks the same powers as Washington state-chartered savings banks and provides that Washington chartered commercial banks may exercise any of the powers that the Federal Reserve has determined to be closely related to the business of banking and the powers of national banks, subject to the approval of the Director of the DFI in certain situations. Finally, the law provides additional flexibility for Washington state-chartered commercial and savings banks with respect to interest rates on loans and other extensions of credit. Specifically, they may charge the maximum interest rate allowable for loans and other extensions of credit by federally-chartered financial institutions to Washington residents.
Environmental Issues Associated With Real Estate Lending. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) is a federal statute that generally imposes strict liability on all prior and present “owners and operators” of sites containing hazardous waste. However, Congress acted to protect secured creditors by providing that the term “owner and operator” excludes a person whose ownership is limited to protecting its security interest in the site. Since the enactment of the CERCLA, this “secured creditor exemption” has been the subject of judicial interpretations that have left open the possibility that lenders could be liable for cleanup costs on contaminated property that they hold as collateral for a loan. To the extent that legal uncertainty exists in this area, all creditors, including First Financial Northwest Bank, that have made loans secured by properties with potential hazardous waste contamination (such as petroleum contamination) could be subject to liability for cleanup costs that often are substantial and can exceed the value of the collateral property.
Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve requires that all depository institutions maintain reserves on transaction accounts and non-personal time deposits. These reserves may be in the form of cash or deposits with the regional Federal Reserve Bank. Interest-bearing demand accounts and other types of accounts that permit payments or transfers to third parties fall within the definition of transaction accounts and are subject to reserve requirements, as are any non-personal time deposits at a savings bank. As of December 31, 2018, First Financial Northwest Bank’s deposits with the FRB exceeded such reserve requirements.
Affiliate Transactions. First Financial Northwest and First Financial Northwest Bank are separate and distinct legal entities. First Financial Northwest (and any non-bank subsidiary of First Financial Northwest) is an affiliate of First Financial Northwest Bank. Federal laws strictly limit the ability of banks to engage in certain transactions with their affiliates. Transactions deemed to be a “covered transaction” under Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act and between a bank and an affiliate are limited to 10% of the bank’s capital and surplus and, with respect to all affiliates, to an aggregate of 20% of the bank’s capital and surplus. Further, covered transactions that are loans and extensions of credit generally are required to be secured by eligible collateral in specified amounts. Federal law also requires that covered transactions and certain other transactions listed in Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act between a bank and its affiliates be on terms as favorable to the bank as transactions with nonaffiliates. For additional information, see “– Regulation and Supervision of First Financial Northwest – Limitations on Transactions with Affiliates” below.
In addition, Sections 22(g) and (h) of the Federal Reserve Act place restrictions on loans to executive officers, directors and principal shareholders. Under Section 22(h), loans to a director, executive officer or greater than 10% shareholder of a bank and certain affiliated interests, may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated interests, the bank’s loans to one borrower limit (generally equal to 15% of the institution’s unimpaired capital and surplus). Section 22(h) also requires that loans to directors, executive officers and principal shareholders be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons unless the loans are made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that (1) is widely available to employees of the institution and (2) does not give preference to any director, executive officer or principal shareholder, or certain affiliated interests, over other employees of the bank. Section 22(h) also requires prior board approval for certain loans. In addition, the aggregate amount of extensions of credit by a bank to all insiders cannot exceed the bank’s unimpaired capital and surplus. Furthermore, Section 22(g) places additional restrictions on loans to executive officers. At December 31, 2018, First Financial Northwest Bank was in compliance with these restrictions.
32

Community Reinvestment Act. First Financial Northwest Bank is subject to the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“CRA”), which require the appropriate federal bank regulatory agency to assess a bank’s performance under the CRA in meeting the credit needs of the community serviced by the bank, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The regulatory agency’s assessment of the bank’s record is made available to the public. Further, a bank’s CRA performance must be considered in connection with a bank’s application, to among other things, establish a new branch office that will accept deposits, relocate an existing office or merge or consolidate with, or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of, a federally regulated financial institution. First Financial Northwest Bank received a “satisfactory” rating during its most recent CRA examination.
Dividends. The amount of dividends payable by First Financial Northwest Bank to First Financial Northwest depends upon First Financial Northwest Bank’s earnings and capital position, and is limited by federal and state laws, regulations and policies. According to Washington law, First Financial Northwest Bank may not declare or pay a cash dividend on its capital stock if it would cause its net worth to be reduced below (1) the amount required for liquidation accounts or (2) the net worth requirements, if any, imposed by the Director of the DFI. In addition, dividends may not be declared or paid if First Financial Northwest Bank is in default in payment of any assessments due to the FDIC. Dividends on First Financial Northwest Bank’s capital stock may not be paid in an aggregate amount greater than the aggregate retained earnings of First Financial Northwest Bank, without the approval of the Director of the DFI.
The amount of dividends actually paid during any one period is affected by First Financial Northwest Bank’s policy of maintaining a strong capital position. Federal law further restricts dividends payable by an institution that does not meet the capital conservation buffer requirement and provides that no insured depository institution may pay a cash dividend if it would cause the institution to be “undercapitalized,” as defined in the prompt corrective action regulations. Moreover, the federal bank regulatory agencies also have the general authority to limit the dividends paid by insured banks if such payments are deemed to constitute an unsafe and unsound practice. 
Privacy Standards. First Financial Northwest Bank is subject to FDIC regulations implementing the privacy protection provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999. These regulations require First Financial Northwest Bank to disclose its privacy policy, including informing consumers of its information sharing practices and informing consumers of their rights to opt out of certain practices.
Anti-Money Laundering and Customer Identification. The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA Patriot Act) was signed into law on October 26, 2001.  The USA PATRIOT Act and the Bank Secrecy Act requires financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts, and, effective in 2018, the beneficial owners of accounts. Bank regulators are directed to consider a holding company’s effectiveness in combating money laundering when ruling on Bank Holding Company Act and Bank Merger Act applications.
Other Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations. The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB and empowered it to exercise broad regulatory, supervisory and enforcement authority with respect to both new and existing consumer financial protection laws. First Financial Northwest Bank is subject to consumer protection regulations issued by the CFPB, but as a financial institution with assets of less than $10 billion, First Financial Northwest Bank is generally subject to supervision and enforcement by the FDIC with respect to its compliance with federal consumer financial protection laws and CFPB regulations.
First Financial Northwest Bank is subject to a broad array of federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations that govern almost every aspect of its business relationships with consumers. While not exhaustive, these laws and regulations include the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act, the Consumer Leasing Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act, the Homeowners Protection Act, the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, laws governing flood insurance, laws governing consumer protections in connection with the sale of insurance, federal and state laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive business practices and various regulations that implement some or all of the foregoing. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans, collecting loans and providing other services. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can subject First Financial Northwest Bank to various penalties, 
33

including but not limited to, enforcement actions, injunctions, fines, civil liability, criminal penalties, punitive damages and the loss of certain contractual rights.
Regulation and Supervision of First Financial Northwest
General. First Financial Northwest, as sole shareholder of First Financial Northwest Bank, is a bank holding company registered with the Federal Reserve. Bank holding companies are subject to comprehensive regulation by the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHCA”), and the regulations of the FRB. Accordingly, First Financial Northwest is required to file quarterly reports with the Federal Reserve and provide additional information as the Federal Reserve may require. The Federal Reserve may examine First Financial Northwest, and any of its subsidiaries, and charge First Financial Northwest for the cost of the examination. The Federal Reserve also has extensive enforcement authority over bank holding companies, including, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to require that a holding company divest subsidiaries (including its bank subsidiaries). In general, enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of law and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. First Financial Northwest is also required to file certain reports with, and otherwise comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC.
The Bank Holding Company Act.  Under the BHCA, First Financial Northwest is supervised by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has a policy that a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act and earlier Federal Reserve policy provide that a bank holding company should serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary bank by having the ability to provide financial assistance to its subsidiary bank during periods of financial distress to the bank. A bank holding company’s failure to meet its obligation to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary bank will generally be considered by the Federal Reserve to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of the Federal Reserve’s regulations or both. No regulations have yet been proposed by the Federal Reserve to implement the source of strength provisions required by the Dodd-Frank Act. First Financial Northwest and any subsidiaries that it may control are considered “affiliates” within the meaning of the Federal Reserve Act, and transactions between First Financial Northwest Bank and affiliates are subject to numerous restrictions. With some exceptions, First Financial Northwest and its subsidiaries are prohibited from tying the provision of various services, such as extensions of credit, to other services offered by First Financial Northwest or by its affiliates.
Acquisitions.  The BHCA prohibits a bank holding company, with certain exceptions, from acquiring ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company and from engaging in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or providing services for its subsidiaries. Under the BHCA, the Federal Reserve may approve the ownership of shares by a bank holding company in any company, the activities of which the Federal Reserve has determined to be so closely related to the business of banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. These activities include:  operating a savings institution, mortgage company, finance company, credit card company or factoring company; performing certain data processing operations; providing certain investment and financial advice; underwriting and acting as an insurance agent for certain types of credit-related insurance; leasing property on a full-payout, non-operating basis; selling money orders, travelers’ checks and U.S. Savings Bonds; real estate and personal property appraising; providing tax planning and preparation services; and, subject to certain limitations, providing securities brokerage services for customers. The Federal Reserve must approve the acquisition (or acquisition of control) of a bank or other FDIC-insured depository institution by a bank holding company, and the appropriate federal banking regulator must approve a bank’s acquisition (or acquisition of control) of another bank or other FDIC-insured institution.
Acquisition of Control of a Bank Holding Company. Under federal law, a notice or application must be submitted to the Federal Reserve if any person (including a company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire “control” of a bank holding company. An acquisition of control can occur upon the acquisition of 10% or more of the voting stock of a bank holding company or as otherwise defined by the Federal Reserve. In considering such a notice or application, the Federal Reserve takes into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the anti-trust effects of the acquisition. Any company that acquires control becomes subject to regulation as a bank holding company.
Regulatory Capital Requirements. As discussed above, pursuant to EGRRCPA, effective August 30, 2018, bank holding companies with less than $3 billion in consolidated assets were generally no longer subject to the Federal Reserve’s capital regulations, which are generally the same as the capital regulations applicable to First Financial Northwest Bank. At the time of this change, First Financial Northwest was considered “well capitalized” (as defined for a bank holding company), with a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or more and a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or more, and was not subject to an individualized order, directive or agreement under which the Federal Reserve requires it to maintain a specific capital level.

Restrictions on Dividends. The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies which expresses its view that a bank holding company must maintain an adequate capital position and generally should not pay cash dividends unless the company’s net income for the past year is sufficient to fully fund the cash dividends and that the prospective rate of earnings appears consistent with the company’s capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition.  The Federal Reserve policy statement also indicates that it would be inappropriate for a company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. For additional information, see Item 1.A. “Risk Factors – Certain regulatory restrictions are imposed on us and lack of compliance could result in monetary penalties and/or additional regulatory actions.” in this report.
Stock Repurchases.  A bank holding company, except for certain “well-capitalized” and highly rated bank holding companies, is required to give the Federal Reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding twelve months, is equal to 10% or more of its consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve order or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve. During the year ended December 31, 2018, First Financial Northwest repurchased 203,900 shares of its common stock.
Federal Securities Laws. First Financial Northwest’s common stock is registered with the SEC under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”). We are subject to information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Exchange Act.
The Dodd-Frank Act. Among other requirements, the Dodd-Frank Act requires public companies, like First Financial Northwest, to (i) provide their shareholders with a non-binding vote (a) at least once every three years on the compensation paid to executive officers and (b) at least once every six years on whether they should have a “say on pay” vote every one, two or three years; (ii) have a separate, non-binding shareholder vote regarding golden parachutes for named executive officers when a shareholder vote takes place on mergers, acquisitions, dispositions or other transactions that would trigger the parachute payments; (iii) provide disclosure in annual proxy materials concerning the relationship between the executive compensation paid and the financial performance of the issuer; and (iv) require companies to disclose the ratio of the Chief Executive Officer’s annual total compensation to the median annual total compensation of all other employees. For certain of these changes, the implementing regulations have not been promulgated, so the full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on public companies cannot be determined at this time.
The federal banking agencies have issued final rules to implement the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act commonly referred to as the Volcker Rule. The regulations contain prohibitions and restrictions on the ability of financial institutions holding companies and their affiliates to engage in proprietary trading and to hold certain interests in, or to have certain relationships with, various types of investment funds, including hedge funds and private equity funds. Management believes First Financial Northwest’s investment portfolio and investment strategies are in compliance with the various provisions of the Volcker Rule regulations.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. As a public company that files periodic reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act, First Financial Northwest, is subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), which addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act represents significant federal involvement in matters traditionally left to state regulatory systems, such as the regulation of the accounting profession, and to state corporate law, such as the relationship between a board of directors and management and between a board of directors and its committees. Our policies and procedures have been updated to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
Taxation
Federal Taxation
General. First Financial Northwest and First Financial Northwest Bank are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to First Financial Northwest or First Financial Northwest Bank. The tax years still open for review by the Internal Revenue Service are 2015 through 2018.
35

First Financial Northwest files a consolidated federal income tax return with First Financial Northwest Bank. Accordingly, any cash distributions made by First Financial Northwest to its shareholders are considered to be taxable dividends and not as a non-taxable return of capital to shareholders for federal and state tax purposes.
Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, First Financial Northwest currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a fiscal year ending on December 31 for filing its federal income tax return.
Minimum Tax. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) effective January 1, 2018, repealed the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT), allowing corporations to fully apply any unused AMT credit. At December 31, 2017, the Company had no AMT credit carryforward to apply against the 2018 tax liability.
Net Operating Loss Carryovers. Under the Tax Act, a financial institution may carryforward net operating losses indefinitely. The Company had no net operating loss carryforwards at December 31, 2018.
Corporate Dividends-Received Deduction. First Financial Northwest may eliminate from its income dividends received from First Financial Northwest Bank as a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Financial Northwest that files a consolidated return with First Financial Northwest Bank. The corporate dividends-received deduction is 100%, or 80%, in the case of dividends received from corporations with which a corporate recipient does not file a consolidated tax return, depending on the level of stock ownership of the payer of the dividend. Corporations that own less than 20% of the stock of a corporation distributing a dividend may deduct 70% of dividends received or accrued on their behalf.
For additional information regarding our federal income taxes, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report.
State Taxation
First Financial Northwest and its subsidiaries are subject to a business and occupation tax imposed under Washington state law at the rate of 1.50% of gross receipts. In addition, various municipalities also assess business and occupation taxes at differing rates. Interest received on loans secured by first lien mortgages or deeds of trust on residential properties, rental income from properties, and certain investment securities are exempt from this tax. An audit by the Washington State Department of Revenue was completed for the years 2010 through 2013, resulting in no material tax revisions. 
The Bank has purchased and originated loans in California. The Company no longer had employees or real estate located in California in 2018, so therefore, will file its final California state tax return for 2018.
