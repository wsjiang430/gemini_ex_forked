Overview
Our Company
We are one of the largest providers of annuity and life insurance products in the United States through multiple independent distribution channels and marketing arrangements with a diverse network of distribution partners. Our in-force book of products consists of approximately 2.5 million insurance policies and annuity contracts at December 31, 2018, which are organized into three reporting segments: 

(i) | Annuities, which includes variable, fixed, index-linked and income annuities;


(ii) | Life, which includes term, universal, whole and variable life policies; and


(iii) | Run-off, which consists of operations related to products which we are not actively selling, and which are separately managed.

In addition, the Company reports certain of its results of operations in Corporate & Other. 
At December 31, 2018, we had $206.3 billion of total assets with total stockholders’ equity of $14.4 billion, including accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”); $134.5 billion of annuity assets under management (“AUM”), which we define as our general account investments and our separate account assets, and approximately $597.7 billion of life insurance face amount in-force, ($414.1 billion, net of reinsurance). Additionally, our insurance subsidiaries had combined statutory total adjusted capital (“TAC”) of $7.4 billion, resulting in a combined action level risk-based capital (“RBC”) in excess of 450% at December 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2018, adjusted statutory earnings were approximately $320 million. Adjusted statutory earnings is a measure of our insurance companies’ generation of statutory distributable cash flows (sometimes referred to as distributable earnings) and is reflective of whether our hedging program functions as intended. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Glossary.”
We seek to be a financially disciplined and, over time, cost-competitive product manufacturer with an emphasis on independent distribution. We aim to leverage our large block of annuity contracts and in-force life insurance policies to operate more efficiently. We believe that our strategy of offering a targeted set of products to serve our customers and distribution partners, each of which is intended to produce positive statutory distributable cash flows on an accelerated basis compared to our legacy products, will enhance our ability to invest in our business and distribute cash to our shareholders over time. We also believe that our product strategy of offering a more tailored set of new products and our decision to outsource a significant portion of our client administration and service processes, is consistent with our focus on reducing our expense structure over time. A key part of our operating strategy is to leverage third parties to deliver certain services important to our business. For example, we have two arrangements with DXC Technology Company, formerly Computer Sciences Corporation (“DXC”) that we entered into (i) in 2016 for the administration of certain in-force policies and (ii) in 2017 for the administration of new life and annuities business and certain in-force life and annuities contracts. As a result of these arrangements, we expect to achieve a phased net reduction in overall expenses for administration of these contracts over the years following our entry into the arrangements.
Risk management of both our in-force book and our new business to enhance sustained, long-term shareholder value is fundamental to our strategy. Consequently, in writing new business we prioritize the value of the new business we write over sales volumes. We assess the value of new products by taking into account the amount and timing of cash flows, the use and cost of capital required to support our financial strength ratings and the cost of risk mitigation. We remain focused on maintaining our strong capital base and we have established a risk management approach that seeks to mitigate the effects of severe market disruptions and other economic events on our business. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business — Our variable annuity exposure management strategy may not be effective, may result in net income volatility and may negatively affect our statutory capital,” “— Segments and Corporate & Other — Annuities” and “— Risk Management Strategies — ULSG Market Risk Exposure Management.”
We believe that general demographic trends in the U.S. population, the increase in under-insured individuals, the potential risk to governmental social safety net programs and the shifting of responsibility for retirement planning and financial security from employers and other institutions to individuals will create opportunities to generate significant demand for our products. We also believe our transition to an independent distribution system will enhance our ability to operate most effectively within the emerging requirements of new and proposed regulations establishing standards of conduct for the sale of insurance and annuity products. See “— Regulation — Standard of Conduct Regulation” for a discussion of these final and proposed regulations.
Prior to the Separation, the companies that became our subsidiaries were wholly owned by MetLife. Brighthouse Life Insurance Company (together with its subsidiaries and affiliates, “BLIC”), which is our largest operating subsidiary, was formed in November 2014 through the merger of three affiliated life insurance companies and a former affiliated offshore reinsurance 
5

subsidiary that mainly reinsured guarantees associated with variable annuity products issued by MetLife affiliates. The principal purpose of the merger was to provide increased transparency relative to capital allocation and variable annuity risk management. In order to further our capabilities to market and distribute our products, prior to the Separation, MetLife contributed to us (i) several entities including Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, New England Life Insurance Company (“NELICO”) and Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY (“BHNY”); (ii) a licensed broker-dealer; (iii) a licensed investment advisor; and (iv) other entities necessary for the execution of our strategy.
Segments and Corporate & Other
The Company is organized into three segments: Annuities; Life; and Run-off. In addition, the Company reports certain of its results of operations in Corporate & Other.
The following table presents the relevant contributions of each of our segments to our net income (loss) available to shareholders and adjusted earnings, for our ongoing business and for the total Company:

Annuities
Overview
Annuities are used by consumers for pre-retirement wealth accumulation and post-retirement income management. The “fixed” and “variable” classifications describe generally whether we or the contract holders bear the investment risk of the assets supporting the contract and determine the manner in which we earn profits from these products, as investment spreads for fixed products or as asset-based fees charged to variable products. Index-linked annuities allow the contract holder to participate in returns from equity indices and, in the case of Shield Annuities (as defined below), provide a specified level of market downside protection. Income annuities provide a guaranteed monthly income for a specified period of years and/or for the life of the annuitant.
The following table presents the insurance liabilities of our annuity products.

(1) | Includes deferred, income and indexed annuities as described below.

We seek to meet our risk-adjusted return objectives in our Annuities segment through a disciplined risk-selection approach and innovative product design, balancing bottom line profitability with top line growth, while remaining focused on margin preservation. Our underwriting approach and product design take into account numerous criteria, including evolving consumer demographics and macroeconomic market conditions, offering a suite of products tailored to respond to external factors without compromising internal constraints. As an example, between 2011 and 2016 we reduced our ANP of our variable annuity contracts by approximately 90%. Beginning in 2013, we began to shift our new annuity business towards products with diversifying market and contract holder behavioral risk attributes and improved risk-adjusted cash returns. Examples of this include 
7

transitioning from the sale of variable annuities with guaranteed minimum income benefits (“GMIBs”) to the sale of variable annuities with guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (“GMWBs”), and our increased emphasis on our Shield Annuities, for which we had new deposits of approximately $3.2 billion, $2.5 billion and $1.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. We believe we have the product design capabilities and distribution relationships to permit us to design and offer new products meeting our risk-adjusted return requirements. We believe these capabilities will enhance our ability to maintain market presence and relevance over the long-term. We intend to meet our risk management objectives by continuing to hedge significant market risks associated with our existing annuity products, as well as new business. See “— Risk Management Strategies — Variable Annuity Statutory Reserving Requirements and Exposure Management.”
Current Products
Our Annuities segment product offerings include fixed, structured, income and variable annuities (each as described below). Our Annuities are designed to address customer needs for tax-deferred asset accumulation and retirement income and their wealth-protection concerns. In 2013, we began a shift in our business towards products with lower guaranteed minimum crediting rates, variable annuity products with less risky living benefits and increased emphasis on index-linked annuity products. Since 2014, our new sales have primarily focused on variable annuities with simplified living benefits and Shield Annuities. As a separate, publicly traded company, we believe we can continue to innovate in response to customer and distributor needs and market conditions.
Fixed Deferred Annuities
Fixed annuities address asset accumulation needs. Purchase payments under deferred fixed annuity contracts are allocated to our general account and are credited with interest at rates we determine, subject to specified guaranteed minimums. Credited interest rates are guaranteed for at least one year. To protect from premature withdrawals, we impose surrender charges. Surrender charges are typically applicable during the early years of the annuity contract, with a declining level of surrender charges over time. We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments and what we credit to our fixed annuity contract holders’ accounts. Surrender charges allow us to recoup amounts we expended to initially market and sell such annuities. Approximately 84% of our fixed annuities have a remaining surrender charge of 2% or less.
We launched a fixed index annuity (“FIA”) with Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company (“MassMutual”) in July 2017. The FIA is a single premium fixed indexed annuity designed for growth that credits interest based on the annual performance of an index. Additionally, an optional living benefit rider is available for an additional charge, designed to provide guaranteed lifetime withdrawals.
Structured Annuities
This family of structured annuities combines certain features similar to variable and fixed annuities. Shield Annuities are a suite of single premium deferred annuity contracts that provides for accumulation of retirement savings or other long-term investment purposes. Shield annuities provide the ability for the contract holder to participate in the appreciation of certain financial markets up to a stated level while offering protection from a portion of declines. Rather than allocating purchase payments directly into the equity market, the customer has an opportunity to participate in the returns of a particular market index. The reserve assets are held in a book value non-unitized separate account, but the issuing insurance company is obligated to pay distributions and benefits irrespective of the value of the separate account assets. Shield Annuities offer account value and return of premium death benefits. Shield Annuities are included with variable annuities in our statutory reserve requirements and conditional tail expectations (“CTE”) estimates.
Income Annuities
Income annuities are annuity contracts under which the contract holder contributes a portion of their retirement assets in exchange for a steady stream of retirement income, lasting either for a specified period of time or as long as the life of the annuitant.
We offer two types of income annuities: immediate income annuities, referred to as “single premium immediate annuities” (“SPIAs”) and deferred income annuities (“DIAs”). Both products provide guaranteed lifetime income that can be used to supplement other retirement income sources. SPIAs are single premium annuity products that provide a guaranteed level of income to the contract holder for a specified number of years or the duration of the life of the annuitant(s) beginning during the first 13 months (in certain products longer) from the SPIA’s start date. DIAs differ from SPIAs in that they require the contract holder to wait at least 15 months before income payments commence. SPIAs and DIAs are priced based on considerations consistent with the annuitant’s age, gender and, in the case of DIAs, the deferral period. DIAs provide a pension-like stream of income payments after a specified deferral period.

Variable Annuities
We issue variable annuity contracts that offer contract holders a tax-deferred basis for wealth accumulation and rights to receive a future stream of payments. The contract holder can choose to invest purchase payments in the separate account or, if available, the general account investment options under the contract. For the separate account options, the contract holder can elect among several subaccounts that invest in internally and externally managed investment portfolios. Unless the contract holder has elected to pay for guaranteed minimum living or death benefits, as discussed below, the contract holder bears the entire risk and receives all of the net returns resulting from the investment option(s) chosen. For the general account options, Brighthouse credits the contract’s account value with the net purchase payment and credits interest to the contract holder at rates declared periodically, subject to a guaranteed minimum crediting rate. The account value of most types of general account options is guaranteed and is not exposed to market risk, because the insurance company rather than the contract holder directly bears the risk that the value of the underlying general account investments of the insurance companies may decline. At December 31, 2018, our variable annuity total account value was $96.6 billion, consisting of $91.8 billion of contract holder separate account assets and $4.8 billion of contract holder general account assets.
The majority of the variable annuities we have issued have GMxBs, which we believe make these products attractive to our customers in periods of economic uncertainty. These GMxBs must be elected by the contract holder no later than at the issuance of the contract. The primary types of GMxBs are those that guarantee death benefits payable upon the death of a contract holder (“GMDBs”) and those that guarantee benefits payable while the contract holder or annuitant is alive (“GMLBs”). There are three primary types of GMLBs: GMIBs, GMWBs, and guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits (“GMABs”). We ceased issuing GMIBs for new purchase in February 2016.
In addition to our directly written business, we also previously assumed from MetLife certain GMxBs pursuant to a coinsurance agreement that was fully recaptured by MetLife in January 2017. For comparative purposes, the tables below do not reflect historical balances for GMxB business recaptured by MetLife.
The guaranteed benefit received by a contract holder pursuant to the GMxBs is calculated based on the benefit base (“Benefit Base”). The calculation of the Benefit Base varies by benefit type and may differ in value from the contract holder’s account value for the following reasons:

• | The Benefit Base is defined to exclude the effect of a decline in the market value of the contract holder’s account value. By excluding market declines, actual claim payments to be made in the future to the contract holder will be determined without giving effect to equity market declines.


• | The terms of the Benefit Base may allow it to increase at a guaranteed rate irrespective of the rate of return on the contract holder’s account value.


• | The Benefit Base may also increase with subsequent purchase payments, after the initial purchase payment made by the contract holder at the issuance of the contract, or at the contract holder’s election with an increase in the account value due to market performance.

GMxBs provide the contract holder with protection against the possibility that a downturn in the markets will reduce the certain specified benefits that can be claimed under the contract. The principal features of our in-force block of variable annuity contracts with GMxBs are as follows:

• | GMDBs, a contract holder’s beneficiaries are entitled to the greater of (a) the account value or (b) the Benefit Base upon the death of the annuitant;


• | GMIBs, a contract holder is entitled to annuitize the policy after a specified period of time and receive a minimum amount of lifetime income based on pre-determined payout factors and the Benefit Base, which could be greater than the account value;


• | GMWBs, a contract holder is entitled to withdraw each year a maximum amount of their Benefit Base, which could be greater than the underlying account value; and


• | GMABs, a contract holder is entitled to a percentage of the Benefit Base, which could be greater than the account value, after the specified accumulation period, regardless of actual investment performance.

Variable annuities may have more than one GMxB. Variable annuities with a GMLB may also have a GMDB. Additional detail concerning our GMxBs is provided in “— Risk Management Strategies — Variable Annuity Statutory Reserving Requirements and Exposure Management.”

Variable Annuity Fees
The following table presents the fees and charges we earn on our variable annuity contracts invested in separate accounts, by type of fee:

 | Years Ended December 31,
 | 2018 | | 2017
 | (In millions) 
Mortality & Expense Fees and Administrative Fees | $ | 1,494 | | | $ | 1,532
Surrender Charges | 24 | | | 27 | 
Investment Management Fees (1) | 239 | | | 247 | 
12b-1 Fees and Other Revenue (1) | 263 | | | 271 | 
Death Benefit Rider Fees | 211 | | | 213 | 
Living Benefit Riders Fees | 929 | | | 937 | 
Total | $ | 3,160 | | | $ | 3,227

_______________

(1) | These fees are net of pass through amounts.

For the account value on contracts that invest through a separate account, we earn various types of fee revenue based on account value, fund assets and Benefit Base. In general, GMxB fees calculated based on the Benefit Base are more stable in market downturns compared to fees based on the account value.
Mortality & Expense Fees and Administrative Fees. We earn mortality and expense fees (“M&E Fees”), as well as administrative fees on variable annuity contracts. The M&E Fees are calculated based on the portion of the contract holder’s account value allocated to the separate accounts and are expressed as an annual percentage deducted daily. These fees are used to offset the insurance and operational expenses relating to our variable annuity contracts. Additionally, the administrative fees are charged either based on the daily average of the net asset values in the subaccounts or when contracts fall below minimum values based on a flat annual fee per contract.
Surrender Charges. Most, but not all, variable annuity contracts depending on their share class may also impose surrender charges on withdrawals for a period of time after the purchase and in certain products for a period of time after each subsequent deposit, also known as the surrender charge period. A surrender charge is a deduction of a percentage of the contract holder’s account value prior to distribution to him or her. Surrender charges generally decline gradually over the surrender charge period, which can range from zero to 10 years. Our variable annuity contracts typically permit contract holders to withdraw up to 10% of their account value each year without any surrender charge, although their guarantees may be significantly impacted by such withdrawals. Contracts may also specify circumstances when no surrender charges apply, for example, upon payment of a death benefit.
The following table presents account value by remaining surrender charge:

 | Variable Annuities (1)
 | December 31, 2018 | | December 31, 2017
 | (In millions) 
0% | $ | 64,770 | | | $ | 65,294

Total | $ | 105,148 | | | $ | 120,640

_______________

(1) | Shield Annuities are included with variable annuities.

Investment Management Fees. We charge investment management fees for managing the proprietary mutual funds managed by our subsidiary Brighthouse Investment Advisers, LLC (“Brighthouse Advisers”) that are offered as investments under the variable annuities. Investment management fees are also paid on the non-proprietary funds managed by investment advisors unaffiliated with us, to the unaffiliated investment advisors. Investment management fees differ by fund. A portion 
10

of the investment management fees charged on proprietary funds managed by subadvisors unaffiliated with us are paid by us to the subadvisors. Investment management fees reduce the net returns on the variable annuity investments.
12b-1 Fees and Other Revenue. 12b-1 fees are paid by the mutual funds which our contract holders chose to invest in and are calculated based on the net assets of the funds allocated to our subaccounts. These fees reduce the returns contract holders earn from these funds. Additionally, mutual fund companies with funds which are available to contract holders through the variable annuity subaccounts pay us fees consistent with the terms of administrative service agreements. These fees are funded from the fund companies’ net revenues.
Death Benefit Rider Fees. We may earn fees in addition to the base M&E fees for promising to pay GMDBs. The fees earned vary by generation and rider type. For some death benefits, the fees are calculated based on account value, but for enhanced death benefits (“EDBs”), the fees are normally calculated based on the Benefit Base. In general, these fees were set at a level intended to be sufficient to cover the anticipated expenses of covering claim payments and hedge costs associated with these benefits. These fees are deducted from the account value.
Living Benefit Riders Fees. We earn these fees for promising to pay guaranteed benefits while the contract holder is alive, such as for any type of GMLB (including GMIBs, GMWBs and GMABs). The fees earned vary by generation and rider type and are typically calculated based on the Benefit Base and deducted from account value. Generally, these fees are set at a level intended to be sufficient to cover the anticipated expenses of covering claim payments and hedge costs associated with these benefits.
In addition to fees, we also earn a spread on the portion of the account value allocated to the general account.
Pricing and Risk Selection
Product pricing reflects our pricing standards and guidelines. Annuities are priced based on various factors, which may include investment returns, expenses, persistency, longevity, policyholder behavior, equity market returns, and interest rate scenarios.
Rates for annuity products are highly regulated and generally the forms of which must be approved by the regulators of the jurisdictions in which the product is sold. The offer and sale of variable annuity products are regulated by the SEC. Generally, these products include pricing terms that are guaranteed for a certain period of time. Such products generally include surrender charges for early withdrawals and fees for guaranteed benefits. We periodically reevaluate the costs associated with such guarantees and may adjust pricing levels accordingly. Further, from time to time, we may also reevaluate the type and level of guarantee features being offered. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates.”
We continually review our pricing guidelines in light of applicable regulations and to ensure that our policies remain competitive and supportive of our marketing strategies and profitability goals.
Evolution of our Variable Annuity Business
Our in-force variable annuity block reflects a wide variety of product offerings within each type of guarantee, reflecting the changing nature of these products over the past two decades. The changes in product features and terms over time are driven partially by customer demand but also reflect our continually refined evaluation of the guarantees, their expected long-term claims costs and the most effective market risk management strategies in the prevailing market conditions.
We introduced our variable annuity product over 50 years ago and began offering GMIBs, which were our first living benefit riders, in 2001. The design of our more recent generations of GMIBs have been modified to reduce payouts in certain circumstances. Beginning in 2009, we reduced the minimum payments we guaranteed if the contract holder were to annuitize; in 2012 we began to reduce the guaranteed portion of account value up to a percentage of the Benefit Base (“roll-up rates”); and, after first reducing the maximum equity allocation in separate accounts, in 2011 we introduced managed volatility funds for all our GMIBs. We ceased offering GMIBs for new purchase in February 2016 and to the extent permitted, we have suspended subsequent premium payments on all but our final generation of GMIBs.
While we added GMWBs to our variable annuity product suite in 2003, we shifted our marketing focus from GMIBs to GMWBs in 2015 with the release of FlexChoiceSM, a GMWB with lifetime payments (“GMWB4L”). In the first quarter of 2018, we launched an updated version of FlexChoiceSM, “Flex Choice Access” to provide financial advisors and their clients more investment flexibility.
In 2013, we introduced Shield Annuities, which generated approximately $3.2 billion, $2.5 billion and $1.7 billion of new deposits for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, representing 71%, 64% and 41% of our annuity deposits for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We intend to increase sales of Shield 
11

Annuities due to growing consumer demand for the products. In addition, we believe that Shield Annuities may provide us with risk offset to the GMxBs offered in our traditional variable annuity products. As of December 31, 2018, there was $8.8 billion of policyholder account balances for Shield Annuities.
With the goal of continuing to diversify and better manage our in-force block, in the future we intend to focus on selling the following products:

• | variable annuities with GMWBs;


• | variable annuities without GMLBs; and


• | Shield Annuities.

We describe below in more detail the product features and relative account values, Benefit Base and net amount at risk (“NAR”) for our death benefit and living benefit guarantees.
Guaranteed Death Benefits
Since 2001, we have offered a variety of GMDBs to our contract holders, which include the following (with no additional charge unless noted):

• | Account Value Death Benefit. The Account Value Death Benefit returns the account value at the time of the claim with no imposition of surrender charges at the time of the claim.


• | Return of Premium Death Benefit. The Return of Premium Death Benefit, also referred to as Principal Protection, comes standard with many of our base contracts and pays the greater of the contract holder’s account value at the time of the claim or their total purchase payments, adjusted proportionately for any withdrawals.


• | Interval Reset. The Reset Death Benefit enables the contract holder to lock in their guaranteed death benefit on the interval anniversary date with this level of death benefit being reset (either up or down) on the next interval anniversary date. This may only be available through a maximum age. This death benefit pays the greater of the contract holder’s account value at the time of the claim, their total purchase payments, adjusted proportionately for any withdrawals, or the interval reset value, adjusted proportionally for any withdrawals. We no longer offer this guarantee.


• | Annual Step-Up Death Benefit. Contract holders may elect, for an additional fee, the option to step up their guaranteed death benefit on any contract anniversary through age 80. The Annual Step-Up Death Benefit allows for the contract holder to lock in the high-water mark on their death benefit adjusted proportionally for any withdrawals. This death benefit may only be elected at issue through age 79. Fees charged for this benefit are usually based on account value. This death benefit pays the greater of the contract holder’s account value at the time of the claim, their total purchase payments, adjusted proportionately for any withdrawals, or the highest anniversary value, adjusted proportionally for any withdrawals.


• | Combination Death Benefit. Contract holders may elect, for an additional fee, a combination death benefit that, in addition to the Annual Step-Up Death Benefit as described above, includes a roll-up feature which accumulates

12

aggregate purchase payments at a predetermined roll-up rate, as adjusted for withdrawals. Descriptions of the two principal versions of this guaranteed death benefit are as follows:

• | Compounded-Plus Death Benefit. The death benefit is the greater of (i) the account value at time of the claim, (ii) the highest anniversary value (highest anniversary value/high water mark through age 80, adjusted proportionately for any withdrawals) or (iii) a roll-up Benefit Base, which rolls up through age 80, and is adjusted proportionally for withdrawals. Fees for this benefit are calculated and charged against the account value. We stopped offering this rider in 2013.


• | Enhanced Death Benefit. The death benefit is equal to the Benefit Base which is defined as the greater of (i) the highest anniversary value Benefit Base (highest anniversary value/high water mark through age 80, adjusted proportionately for any withdrawals) or (ii) a roll-up benefit, which may apply to the step-up (rollup applies through age 90), which allows for dollar-for-dollar withdrawals up to the permitted amount for that contract year and proportional adjustments for withdrawals in excess of the permitted amount. The fee may be increased upon step-up of the roll-up Benefit Base. Fees charged for this benefit are calculated based on the Benefit Base and charged annually against the account value. We stopped offering this rider on a stand-alone basis in 2011.

In addition, we currently also offer an optional death benefit for an additional fee with our FlexChoiceSM GMWB4L riders, available at issue through age 65, which has a similar level of death benefit protection as the Benefit Base for the living benefit rider. However, the Benefit Base for this death benefit is adjusted for all withdrawals.

Guaranteed Living Benefits
Our in-force block of variable annuities consists of three varieties of GMLBs, including variable annuities with GMIBs, GMWBs and GMABs. Since 2001, we have offered a variety of guaranteed living benefit riders to our contract holders. Based on total account value, approximately 79% and 80% of our variable annuity block included living benefit guarantees at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
GMIBs. GMIBs are our largest block of living benefit guarantees based on in-force account value. Contract holders must wait for a defined period, usually 10 years, before they can elect to receive income through guaranteed annuity payments. This initial period when the contract holder invests their account value in the separate and/or general account to grow on a tax-deferred basis is often referred to as the accumulation phase. The contract holder may elect to continue the accumulation phase beyond the waiting period in order to maintain access to their account value or continue to participate in the potential growth of both the account value and Benefit Base pursuant to the contract terms. During the accumulation phase, the contract holder still has access to his or her account value through the following choices, although their Benefit Base may be adjusted downward consistent with these choices:

• | Partial surrender or withdrawal to a maximum specified amount each year (typically 10% of account value). This action does not trigger surrender charges, but the Benefit Base is adjusted downward depending on the contract terms;

13


• | Full surrender or lapse of the contract, with the net proceeds paid to the contract holder being the then prevailing account value less surrender charges defined in the contract; or


• | Limited “Dollar-for-Dollar Withdrawal” from the account value as described in the paragraph below.

The second phase of the contract starts upon annuitization. The occurrence and timing of annuitization depends on how contract holders choose to utilize the multiple benefit options available to them in their annuity contract. Below are examples of contract holder benefit utilization choices that can affect benefit payment patterns and reserves:

• | Lapse. The contract holder may lapse or exit the contract at which time all GMxB guarantees are canceled. If he or she partially exits, the GMxB Benefit Base may be reduced in accordance with the contract terms.


• | Use of Guaranteed Principal Option after waiting period. For certain GMIB contracts issued since 2005, the contract holder has the option to receive a lump sum return of initial premium less withdrawals (the Benefit Base does not apply) in exchange for cancellation of the GMIB optional benefit.


• | Dollar-for-Dollar Withdrawal. The contract holder may, in any year, withdraw, without penalty and regardless of the underlying account value, a portion of his or her account value up to a percentage of the Benefit Base (“roll-up rate”). The withdrawal reduces the contract holder’s Benefit Base “dollar-for-dollar.” If making such withdrawals in combination with market movements reduces the account value to zero, the contract may have an automatic annuitization feature, which entitles the contract holder to receive a stream of lifetime (with period certain) annuity payments based on a variety of factors, including the Benefit Base, the age and gender of the annuitant, and predetermined annuity interest rates and mortality rates. The Benefit Base depends on the contract terms, but the majority of our in-force has a greater of roll-up or step-up combination Benefit Base similar to the roll-up and step-up Benefit Base described above in “— Guaranteed Death Benefits.” Any withdrawal greater than the roll-up rate would result in a penalty which may be a proportional reduction in the Benefit Base.


• | Elective Annuitization. The contract holder may elect to annuitize the account value or exercise the guaranteed annuitization under the GMIB. The guaranteed annuitization entitles the contract holder to receive a stream of lifetime (with period certain) annuity payments based on the same factors that would be used as if the contract holder elected to annuitize.


• | Do nothing. If the contract holder elects to continue to remain in the accumulation phase past the maximum age for electing annuitization under the GMIB and the account value has not depleted to zero, then the contract will continue as a variable annuity with a death benefit. The Benefit Base for the death benefit may be the same as the Benefit Base for the GMIB.

Contract holder behaviors around choosing a particular option cannot be predicted with certainty at the time of contract issuance or thereafter. The incidents and timing of benefit elections and the resulting benefit payments may materially differ from those we anticipate at the time we issue a variable annuity contract. As we observe actual contract holder behavior, we periodically update our assumptions with respect to contract holder behavior and take appropriate action with respect to the amount of the reserves we establish for the future payment of such benefits. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business — Guarantees within certain of our products may decrease our earnings, decrease our capitalization, increase the volatility of our results, result in higher risk management costs and expose us to increased market risk and counterparty risk” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates.”
We have employed several risk exposure reduction strategies at the product level. These include reducing the interest rates used to determine annuity payout rates on GMIBs from 2.5% to 0.5% over time, partially in response to sustained low interest rates. In addition, we increased the setback period used to determine the annuity payout rates for contract holders from seven years to 10 years. For example, a 10 year age setback would determine actual annuitization monthly payout rates for a contract holder assuming they were 10 years younger than their actual age at the time of annuitization, thereby reducing the monthly guaranteed annuity claim payments. We have also reduced the guarantee roll-up rates from 6% to 4%.
Additionally, we introduced limitations on fund selections inside variable annuity contracts. In 2005, we reduced the maximum equity allocation in the separate accounts. Further, in 2011 we introduced managed volatility funds to our fund offerings in conjunction with the introduction of our last generation GMIB product “Max.” Approximately 32% and 33% of the $56.0 billion and $67.1 billion of GMIB total account value as of both December 31, 2018 and 2017, was invested in managed volatility funds. The managers of these funds seek to reduce the risk of large, sudden declines in account value 
14

during market downturns by managing the volatility or draw-down risk of the underlying fund holdings by re-balancing the fund holdings within certain guidelines or overlaying hedging strategies at the fund level. We believe that these risk mitigation actions at the fund level reduce the amount of hedging or reinsurance we require to manage our risks arising from guarantees we provide on the underlying variable annuity separate accounts.
GMWBs. GMWBs have a Benefit Base that contract holders may roll up for up to 10 years. If contract holders take withdrawals early, the roll-up may be less than 10 years. This is in contrast to GMIBs, in which roll ups may continue beyond 10 years. Therefore, the roll-up period for the Benefit Base on GMWBs is typically less uncertain and is shorter than those on GMIBs. Additionally, the contract holder may receive income only through withdrawal of his or her Benefit Base. These withdrawal percentages are defined in the contract and differ by the age when contract holders start to take withdrawals. Withdrawal rates may differ if they are offered on a single contract holder or a couple (joint life). GMWBs primarily come in two versions depending on if they are period certain or if they are lifetime payments, GMWB4L.
GMABs. GMABs guarantee a minimum amount of account value to the contract holder after a set period of time, which can also include locking in capital market gains. This protects the value of the annuity from market fluctuations.
The table below presents the breakdown of our variable annuity account value and Benefit Base by type of GMLBs as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.

 | December 31, 2018 (1)(2) | | December 31, 2017 (1)(2)

(1) | Many of our annuity contracts offer more than one type of guarantee such that living benefit guarantee amounts listed above are not mutually exclusive to the amounts in the GMDBs table above.


(2) | As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the total account value includes investments in the general account totaling $4.8 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively.

Net Amount at Risk
The NAR for the GMDB is the amount of death benefit in excess of the account value (if any) as of the balance sheet date. It represents the amount of the claim we would incur if death claims were made on all contracts on the balance sheet date and includes any additional contractual claims associated with riders purchased to assist with covering income taxes payable upon death.
The NAR for the GMWB and GMAB is the amount of guaranteed benefit in excess of the account values (if any) as of the balance sheet date. The NAR assumes utilization of benefits by all contract holders as of the balance sheet date. For the GMWB benefits, only a small portion of the Benefit Base is available for withdrawal on an annual basis. For the GMAB, the NAR would not be available until the GMAB maturity date.
The NAR for the GMWB4L is the amount (if any) that would be required to be added to the total account value to purchase a lifetime income stream, based on current annuity rates, equal to the lifetime amount provided under the guaranteed benefit. For contracts where the GMWB4L provides for a guaranteed cumulative dollar amount of payments, the NAR is based on the purchase of a lifetime with period certain income stream where the period certain ensures payment of this cumulative dollar amount. The NAR represents our potential economic exposure to such guarantees in the event all contract holders were to begin lifetime withdrawals on the balance sheet date regardless of age. Only a small portion of the Benefit Base is available for withdrawal on an annual basis.
The NAR for the GMIB is the amount (if any) that would be required to be added to the total account value to purchase a lifetime income stream, based on current annuity rates, equal to the minimum amount provided under the guaranteed benefit. This amount represents our potential economic exposure to such guarantees in the event all contract holders were to annuitize on the balance sheet date, even though the guaranteed amount under the contracts may not be annuitized until after the waiting period of the contract.

Reserves
Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), certain of our variable annuity guarantee features are accounted for as insurance liabilities and recorded on the balance sheet in Future Policy Benefits with changes reported in policyholder benefits and claims. These liabilities are accounted for using long term assumptions of equity and bond market returns and the level of interest rates. Therefore, these liabilities, valued at $4.6 billion as of December 31, 2018, are less sensitive than derivative instruments to periodic changes to equity and fixed income market returns and the level of interest rates. Guarantees accounted for in this manner include GMDBs, as well as the life contingent portion of GMIBs and certain GMWBs. All other variable annuity guarantee features are accounted for as embedded derivatives and recorded on the balance sheet in Policyholder Account Balances with changes reported in net derivative gains (losses). These liabilities, valued at $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2018, are accounted for at fair value. Guarantees accounted for in this manner include GMABs, GMWBs and the non-life contingent portions of GMIBs. In some cases, a guarantee will have multiple features or options that require separate accounting such that the guarantee is not fully accounted for under only one of the accounting models (known as “split accounting”). Additionally, the index protection and accumulation features of Shield Annuities are accounted for as embedded derivatives, recorded on the balance sheet in policyholder account balances with changes reported in net derivative gains (losses) and valued at $488 million as of December 31, 2018. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates.”

The carrying values of these guarantees can change significantly during periods of sizable and sustained shifts in equity market performance, equity market volatility, or interest rates. Carrying values are also affected by our assumptions around mortality, separate account returns and policyholder behavior, including lapse, annuitization and withdrawal rates. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business — Guarantees within certain of our products may decrease our earnings, decrease 
17

our capitalization, increase the volatility of our results, result in higher risk management costs and expose us to increased market risk and counterparty risk.” Furthermore, changes in policyholder behavior assumptions can result in additional changes in accounting estimates.
Life
Overview
Our Life segment manufactures products to serve our target segments through a broad independent distribution network. While our in-force book reflects a broad range of life products, we have focused on term life and universal life, consistent with our financial objectives, with a concentration on design and profitability over volume. By managing our in-force book of business, we expect to generate future revenue and profits for the Company. The Life segment generates profits from premiums, investment margins, expense margins, mortality margins, morbidity margins and surrender fees. We aim to maximize our profits by focusing on operational excellence and cost optimization in order to continue to reduce the cost basis and underwriting expenses. Our life insurance in-force book provides natural diversification to our Annuity segment and a source of future profits.
The following table presents the insurance liabilities of our life insurance products.

Products
We currently offer term life and universal life products.
Term Life
Term life products are designed to provide a fixed death benefit in exchange for a guaranteed level premium to be paid over a specified period of time, usually 10 to 30 years. A one-year term option is also offered. Our term life product does not include any cash value, accumulation or investment components. As a result, it is our most basic life insurance product offering and generally has lower premiums than other forms of life insurance. Term life products may allow the policyholder to continue coverage beyond the guaranteed level premium period, generally at an elevated cost. Some of our term life policies allow the policyholder to convert the policy during the conversion period to a permanent policy. Such conversion does not require additional medical or financial underwriting. Term life products allow us to spread expenses over a large number of policies while gaining mortality insights that come from high policy volumes.
Universal Life
Universal life products provide a death benefit in return for payment of specified annual policy charges that are generally related to specific costs, which may change over time. To the extent that the policyholder chooses to pay more than the charges required in any given year to keep the policy in-force, the excess premium will be added to the cash value of the policy and credited with a stated interest rate. This structure gives policyholders flexibility in the amount and timing of premium payments, subject to tax guidelines. Consequently, universal life policies can be used in a variety of different ways. We may market universal life policies focused on cash accumulation within the policy; this can be accessed later via surrender, withdrawals, loans or ultimate payment of the death benefit. Our policies may feature limited surrender charges and low initial compensation related to policy expenses, compared to our competitors.
Whole Life
Although we have a significant in-force book of whole life policies, we suspended new sales of participating whole life and conversions into participating whole life beginning with the first quarter of 2017. Whole life products provide a guaranteed death benefit in exchange for a guaranteed level premium for a specified period of time in order to maintain coverage for the life of the insured. Whole life products also have guaranteed minimum cash surrender values. Our in-force whole life products provide for participation in the returns generated by the business, delivered to the policyholder in the form of non-guaranteed dividend payments. The policyholder can elect to receive the dividends in cash or to use them to increase the paid-up policy death benefit or pay the required premium. They can also be used for other purposes, including payment of loans and loan interest. The versatility of whole life allows it to be used for a variety of purposes beyond just the primary purpose of death benefit protection. With our in-force policies, the policyholder can withdraw or borrow against the policy (sometimes on a tax favored basis). In November 2017, we launched a non-participating conversion whole life product that is available for term and group conversions and to satisfy other contractual obligations.
Variable Life
Although we have a significant in-force book of variable life policies, we suspended new sales of certain variable life policies and conversions into certain variable life policies beginning with the first quarter of 2017. We may choose to issue additional variable life products in the future. Variable life products operate similarly to universal life products, with the additional feature that the excess amount paid over policy charges can be directed by the policyholder into a variety of separate account investment options. In the separate account investment options, the policyholder bears the entire risk of the investment results. We collect specified fees for the management of the investment options in addition to the base policy charges. In some instances, third-party asset management firms manage these investment options. The policyholder’s cash value reflects the investment return of the selected investment options, net of management fees and insurance-related charges. With some products, by maintaining a certain premium level, policyholders may also have the advantage of various guarantees designed to protect the death benefit from adverse investment experience.
Pricing and Underwriting
Pricing
Life insurance pricing at issuance is based on the expected payout of benefits calculated using our assumptions for mortality, morbidity, premium payment patterns, sales mix, expenses, persistency and investment returns, as well as certain macroeconomic factors, such as inflation. Our product pricing models consider additional factors, such as hedging costs, reinsurance programs, and capital requirements. Our product pricing reflects our pricing standards and guidelines. We continually review our pricing guidelines in light of applicable regulations and to ensure that our policies remain competitive and supportive of our marketing strategies and profitability goals.
19

We have a dedicated unit, the primary responsibility of which is the development of product pricing standards and independent pricing and underwriting oversight for our insurance business. Further important controls around management of underwriting and pricing processes include regular experience studies to monitor assumptions against expectations, formal new product approval processes, periodic updates to product profitability studies and the use of reinsurance to manage our exposures, as appropriate. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates — Reinsurance.”
Underwriting
Underwriting generally involves an evaluation of applications by a professional staff of underwriters and actuaries, who determine the type and the amount of insurance risk that we are willing to accept. We employ detailed underwriting policies, guidelines and procedures designed to assist the underwriters to properly assess and quantify such risks before issuing policies to qualified applicants or groups.
Insurance underwriting may consider not only an insured’s medical history, but also other factors such as the insured’s foreign travel, vocations, alcohol, drug and tobacco use, and the policyholder’s financial profile. We generally perform our own underwriting; however, certain policies are reviewed by intermediaries under guidelines established by us. Requests for coverage are reviewed on their merits and a policy is not issued unless the particular risk has been examined and approved in accordance with our underwriting guidelines.
The underwriting conducted by our corporate underwriting office and intermediaries is subject to periodic quality assurance reviews to maintain high standards of underwriting and consistency. The office is also subject to periodic external audits by reinsurers with whom we do business.
We have established oversight of the underwriting process that facilitates quality sales and serves the needs of our customers, while supporting our financial strength and business objectives. Our goal is to achieve the underwriting, mortality and morbidity levels reflected in the assumptions in our product pricing. This is accomplished by determining and establishing underwriting policies, guidelines, philosophies and strategies that are competitive and suitable for the customer, the agent and us.
We continually review our underwriting guidelines (i) in light of applicable regulations and (ii) to ensure that our practices remain competitive and supportive of our marketing strategies, emerging industry trends and profitability goals.
Run-off
This segment consists of operations related to products which we are not actively selling, and which are separately managed, including structured settlements, pension risk transfer contracts, company-owned life insurance (“COLI”) policies, funding agreements and ULSG. With the exception of ULSG, these legacy business lines were not part of MetLife’s former Retail segment but were issued by certain of the legal entities that are now part of Brighthouse.

Risk Management Strategies
Variable Annuity Statutory Reserving Requirements and Exposure Management
We are required to calculate the statutory reserves which support our variable annuity products in conformity with Valuation Manual Chapter 21 for 2017 and later new issues and Actuarial Guideline 43 for earlier issues (collectively, “AG 43”) issued by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”). The principal components of AG 43 are a deterministic calculation based on a single standard scenario (“Standard Scenario”) and a calculation utilizing stochastic scenario analysis across a set of capital market scenarios, referred to as CTE. AG 43 requires that we carry reserves for our variable annuity contracts that include the greater of the amount determined under the Standard Scenario or CTE.
The Standard Scenario reflects an instantaneous drop in account values followed by a recovery in each case using returns specified in AG 43. Unlike CTE, which is calculated on an aggregate basis, the Standard Scenario is a seriatim (policy-by-policy) calculation which does not permit deficiencies for certain contracts to be offset by redundancies in other contracts. In addition, the Standard Scenario has prescribed assumptions, including those for policyholder behavior, which we believe to be conservative when applied to GMIB products. 
CTE is a statistical tail risk measure used to assess the adequacy of assets supporting variable annuity contract liabilities by averaging the worst “x” percent of a set of stochastic capital market scenarios used, which is commonly described as CTE100 less “x.” The CTE calculation under AG 43 represents the result derived from the worst 30% of these stochastic scenarios, or “CTE70.” Although the NAIC does not specify the exact scenarios used, it has issued guidelines that must be complied with when selecting the scenarios used. 
The results of the Standard Scenario and CTE70 calculations under AG 43 may differ materially. We held $7.1 billion of statutory reserves, including voluntary reserves, to support our variable annuity products at December 31, 2018.
On August 7, 2018, the NAIC approved the framework for variable annuity reserve and capital reform, which includes modifications to the calculation of RBC. See “— Regulation — Insurance Regulation — NAIC.” Under this approach, a total asset requirement (“TAR”) is determined by estimating the amount of assets that are currently required in order to satisfy contract holder obligations across a set of capital market scenarios. For capital and risk management purposes, we target a level of assets between CTE95 and CTE99 (each defined as the amount of assets required to satisfy contract holder obligations across market environments in the average of the worst five percent and one percent of a set of capital market scenarios over the life of the contracts, “CTE95” and “CTE99,” respectively). In the third quarter of 2018, we incorporated our best estimate interpretation of the new NAIC framework in our management metrics used for capital and risk management. We expect to continue to maintain exposure risk management programs that result in total assets supporting our variable annuity contracts at or above the “CTE98” level (defined as the amount of assets required to satisfy contract holder obligations across market environments in the average of the worst two percent of a set of capital market scenarios over the life of the contracts) in normal market conditions, and in excess of the CTE95 level in most plausible stressed market conditions. For statutory reporting purposes, we will incorporate the new framework when permitted by our state regulators. We expect this to begin at the earliest for year end 2019 and may be gradually phased in over a couple of years.
We refer to our target level of TAR assets as our “Variable Annuity Target Funding Level.” We intend to manage our Variable Annuity Assets at or above our Variable Annuity Target Funding Level of CTE98 in normal markets. Our CTE98 target level at December 31, 2018 was $11.3 billion and total Variable Annuity Assets were $11.7 billion, or approximately $0.3 billion above CTE98. The growth in Variable Annuity Assets since December 31, 2017 is principally driven by gains on derivative instruments recognized in the fourth quarter of 2018, capital contributions and the positive cash flows generated by our variable annuity business as the fees earned are only partially offset by claims and expenses. Assets may be above the CTE98 level as part of our hedging strategy of using out-of-the-money derivatives. Additionally, under stressed conditions, we intend to allow the Variable Annuity Assets to range between a variable annuity hedging target floor level of CTE95 and CTE98. This is consistent with our VA hedging strategy of protecting a floor level of assets at or above CTE95 under market stress and thereafter building back to a CTE98 level through retained statutory results and capital actions.
Our exposure risk management program seeks to mitigate the potential adverse effects of changes in capital markets, specifically equity markets and interest rates, on our Variable Annuity Target Funding Level and hence our view of statutory distributable cash flows. We utilize a combination of short-term and longer-term derivative instruments to have a laddered maturity of protection and reduce roll over risk during periods of market disruption or higher volatility. We continually monitor the capital markets for opportunities to adjust our derivative positions to manage our variable annuity exposure, as appropriate.

Period to period changes in the estimated fair value of these hedges affect our net income, as well as stockholders’ equity and these effects can be material in any given period. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business — Our variable annuity exposure management strategy may not be effective, may result in net income volatility and may negatively affect our statutory capital” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates.”
The principal components of our exposure risk management strategy are described in further detail below:

• | Variable Annuity Assets - This includes both derivative assets and non-derivative assets. We intend to continue to hold non-derivative assets supporting our variable annuity contracts to sustain asset adequacy during modest market downturns without substantial reliance on gains on derivative instruments and accordingly, reduce the need for hedging the daily or weekly fluctuations from small movements in capital markets. At December 31, 2018, we held derivative and non-derivative assets in excess of the CTE98 level.


• | Hedge Target - We focus our hedging activities primarily on mitigating the risk from larger movements in capital markets, which may deplete variable annuity contract holder account values, and may increase long-term variable annuity guarantee claims. When we determine hedges to hold for this risk, we consider the fact that our obligations under Shield Annuity contracts decrease in falling equity markets when variable annuity guarantee obligations increase and increase in rising equity markets when variable annuity guarantee obligations decrease. Additionally, we believe that holding longer dated assets including derivative instruments is consistent with the long-term nature of our variable annuity contract guarantees. We believe this will result in our being less exposed to the risk that we will be unable to roll-over expiring derivative instruments into new derivative instruments consistent with our hedge strategy on economically attractive terms and conditions. Over time, we expect our variable annuity exposure management strategy will allow us to reduce net hedge costs and increase long-term value for our shareholders for various reasons, including:


• | Protect against more significant market risks. Protecting against larger market movements can be achieved at a lower cost through the use of derivatives with strike levels that are below the current market level, referred to as “out-of-the-money.” These derivatives, typically, require a lower premium outlay than those with strike levels at the current market level, known as “at the money.” However, they may result in higher bid-ask spread or trading cost, if frequently re-balanced. Additionally, we believe a strategy using primarily options will produce fewer losses from extreme realized volatility over a compressed time period, with potentially multiple up and down-market movements, referred to as “gamma losses.”


• | Reduce transaction costs associated with hedge execution. Less frequent rebalancing of derivative positions can reduce trading costs. This approach is commonly described as a “semi-static hedging” approach. With a greater emphasis on semi-static hedging, we generally favor using longer-term option instruments.


• | Improve statutory results in rising markets. First dollar dynamic hedging strategies, for example using futures or swaps, have similar symmetrical impacts in both rising and falling markets. Therefore, while protecting for market downside situations, first dollar dynamic hedging strategies also incur first dollar losses in rising markets, which is what we refer to as selling upside. We have reduced the use of futures and swaps (as reflected

22

in the preceding table), which should improve statutory earnings for the Company in the event markets outperform our baseline expectations.
We believe the higher statutory earnings that our strategy may generate can be used to increase financial flexibility and support deploying capital for growing long-term, sustainable shareholder value. However, because this hedge strategy places a lower priority on offsetting changes to GAAP liabilities and moderate market movement impacts to statutory capital, some GAAP net income and statutory capital volatility could result when markets are volatile.
Variable Annuity Sensitivities
Set forth below are several tables related to our variable annuity block: (i) sensitivity of our Variable Annuity Assets above CTE98 to instantaneous changes in equity markets and interest rates; (ii) CTE98 peak level over time; (iii) Variable Annuity statutory distributable cash flows over three and five years across five capital market scenarios; (iv) the present value of Variable Annuity product cash flows (including hedging results) over the next fifty years across five capital market scenarios and (v) sensitivity of GAAP net income. All of these tables reflect our current best estimate of the interaction impacts between our variable annuity guarantees and Shield Annuities.
Sensitivity of Variable Annuity Assets Above CTE98
The following table estimates the impact of various instantaneous changes in equity markets and interest rates, assuming implied volatility is held constant with respect to market levels at December 31, 2018 on the estimated Variable Annuity Assets supporting our variable annuity contracts, as well as on the corresponding resulting CTE9x level. It does not reflect an increase in total asset requirements as the block of business seasons over time. For purposes of the table we have estimated the impacts of these equity market and interest rate changes on our (i) variable annuity contract liabilities as of December 31, 2018; and (ii) Variable Annuity Assets consisting of derivative instruments as of December 31, 2018. The impacts presented below are not representative of the aggregate changes that could result if a combination of such changes to equity markets and interest rates occurred. The combined impacts of equity and interest rate movements may differ from the sum of their individual sensitivities.

_______________

(1) | Variable Annuity Assets backing TAR related specifically to reserve and target risk capital.


(2) | Reflects the nearest CTE level that the Variable Annuity Assets are equal to or exceed.

CTE98 Peak Levels
Based on our Base Case Scenario (as defined below), we believe the Variable Annuity Target Funding Level for our variable annuity in-force book (“VA In-Force”) will continue to increase over time until it approaches its peak level in approximately 7 years. We believe this to be typical of most insurance liabilities, where reserves or reserves and required capital, combined as total asset requirements, increase as the block of business seasons over time until it reaches maturity. After maturity, total asset requirements decline, thereby permitting a release of assets and an increase to retained capital and surplus. Assuming our Base Case Scenario, as of December 31, 2018, our Variable Annuity Target Funding Level was approximately 97% of the estimated peak level of our total Variable Annuity Asset requirements. By December 31, 2023, we believe that we will be holding approximately 99% of the expected peak Variable Annuity Target Funding Level as shown in the following table:

 | 2018 | | 2023 | | 2025 | | 2028
 | (Dollars in billions)
Variable Annuity Target Funding Level (CTE98) | $ | 11.3 | | | $ | 11.5 | | | $ | 11.6 | | $ | 10.9
Percent of peak Variable Annuity Target Funding Level | 97 | % | | 99 | % | | 100 | % | | 93 | %

We anticipate that our increasing total asset requirements will be funded with revenues from our VA In-Force, net of expenses, exposure management impacts and commitments for the Variable Annuity business. We expect the residual cash 
23

flows will be available for investment in new business, as well as other corporate purposes. Additionally, after the business is past the peak level, we expect the Variable Annuity Target Funding Level to decline and increase distributable earnings to provide a source of cash flow to shareholders.
The following table is based on Scenario 4 (as defined below). We believe this helps represent the impact that aging has on the Variable Annuity Target Funding Level, which is growth that occurs in the CTE98 requirement assuming separate account funds earn modest premium to risk-free rates and interest rates follow the forward curve. We estimate this impact to be approximately $850 million per year through 2023, declining to approximately $500 million per year through 2025.

 | 2018 | | 2023 | | 2025 | | 2028
 | (Dollars in billions)
Variable Annuity Target Funding Level (CTE98) | $ | 11.3 | | | $ | 15.6 | | | $ | 16.6 | | $ | 16.2
Percent of peak Variable Annuity Target Funding Level | 68 | % | | 94 | % | | 100 | % | | 97 | %

Sensitivity of Cash Flows
We present five scenarios to illustrate our projected sensitivity of variable annuity distributable earnings and the total present value of cash flows to different potential equity market and interest rate levels. We refer to one such scenario as the “Base Case Scenario.” The Base Case Scenario is representative of relatively stable future market conditions, growing at rates that have historically been observed in U.S. capital markets. As a result, while the Base Case Scenario may be no more or less probable than any of the other illustrative scenarios, for the purpose of establishing certain financial targets, management utilizes the Base Case Scenario.

 | Assumptions 
Base Case Scenario | Separate Account Returns: 6.5%Interest Rate Yields: mean reversion of 10 Year UST to 4.25% over 10 years 
Scenario 2 | Separate Account Returns: 9.0%Interest Rate Yields: mean reversion of 10 Year UST to 4.25% over 10 years 
Scenario 3 | Separate Account Returns: 4.0%Interest Rate Yields: mean reversion of 10 Year UST to 4.25% over 10 years 
Scenario 4 | Separate Account Returns: 4.0%Interest Rate Yields: follows the forward U.S. Treasury and swap interest rate curve as of December 31, 2018. 
Scenario 5 | Separate Account Returns: (25)% shock to equities, then 6.5% separate account returnInterest Rate Yields: 10-year U.S. Treasury interest rates drop to 1.5%, and increase to 1.7% over 10 years

The tables below estimate the impact of distributable statutory cash flow from our variable annuity business for both the three and five annual periods beginning December 31, 2018, under the above defined five capital market scenarios. These values are presented on a pre-tax basis. Effective year end 2017, we made certain tax elections related to our variable annuity hedging program to better align recognition of taxes on hedge gain (loss) with the longer-term nature of the hedges and reduce any potential tax friction impacts due to the difference in the amount of tax reserves and the hedge target based on CTE95. The Company believes statutory distributable cash flows from our variable annuity business in the Base Case Scenario continues to support our capital return target.

Sensitivity of GAAP Net Income 
The primary drivers of GAAP liability sensitivity to changes in capital markets are Variable Annuity and Shield embedded derivatives carried at fair value. The following table estimates the GAAP net income impact, on a post-tax basis, of various instantaneous changes in equity markets and interest rates, assuming implied volatility is held constant with respect to market levels at December 31, 2018 on the derivative instruments in our Variable Annuity Assets and the GAAP embedded derivative liabilities, excluding the impacts of changes in our non-performance risk and risk margin. The impacts presented below are not representative of the aggregate changes that could result if a combination of such changes to equity markets and interest rates occurred. The changes exclude any other GAAP impacts, including but not limited to the sensitivity of DAC and guarantees accounted for as insurance to changes in capital markets.

Additional Assumptions Underlying Sensitivities for Variable Annuities
The preceding sensitivities and scenarios discussed in this sensitivities section (the “Analyses”) are estimates and are not intended to predict the future financial performance of our variable annuity hedging program or to represent an opinion of market value. They were selected for illustrative purposes only and they do not purport to encompass all of the many factors that may bear upon a market value and are based on a series of assumptions as to the future. It should be recognized that actual future results may differ from those shown, on account of changes in the operating and economic environments and natural variations in experience. The results shown are presented as of December 31, 2018 and no assurance can be given that future experience will be in line with the assumptions made.
Additionally, neither the NAIC nor any state insurance department has promulgated guidelines around the method and format of scenarios an insurance company must use in its CTE calculations. As a result, the assumptions underlying these Analyses and the CTE measures we apply may differ from those followed or developed by other insurance companies. See “Risk Factors — Risk Related to Our Business — Our analyses of scenarios and sensitivities utilized in connection with our variable annuity risk management strategies involve significant estimates based on assumptions that may result in material differences in actual outcomes compared to the sensitivities calculated under such scenarios.”
Additionally, in the modeling supporting our Analyses, we use seriatim calculations, that is, each individual annuity contract is considered.
ULSG Market Risk Exposure Management
The ULSG block includes the business that resides in our operating insurance companies and the portion of it that is ceded to Brighthouse Reinsurance Company of Delaware (“BRCD”) for providing redundant, non-economic reserve financing support. The primary market risk associated with our ULSG block is the uncertainty around the future levels of U.S. interest rates and bond yields. To help ensure we have sufficient assets to meet future ULSG policyholder obligations, we have employed an actuarial approach based upon NY Regulation 126 Cash Flow Testing (“ULSG CFT”) as the basis for setting our ULSG asset requirement target for BRCD. For the business that remains in the operating companies, we set our ULSG asset requirement target to equal the actuarially determined statutory reserves, which, taken together with our ULSG asset requirement target of BRCD, comprises our total ULSG asset requirement target (“ULSG Target”). Under the ULSG CFT approach, we assume that interest rates remain flat or lower than current levels and our actuarial assumptions include a provision for adverse deviation. These underlying assumptions used in ULSG CFT are more conservative than those required under GAAP, which assumes a long-term upward mean reversion of interest rates and best estimate actuarial assumptions without additional provisions for adverse deviation.
We seek to mitigate interest rate exposures associated with these liabilities by holding ULSG Assets to closely match our ULSG Target under different interest rate environments. “ULSG Assets” are defined as (i) total general account assets in the operating companies and BRCD supporting statutory reserves and capital and (ii) interest rate derivative instruments dedicated to mitigating ULSG interest rate exposures. At December 31, 2018, the statutory reserves for the ULSG business (in our operating companies and BRCD) were $22.0 billion supported by approximately $7.0 billion of reserve financings in BRCD, and GAAP reserves were $12.0 billion.
26

Our ULSG Target is sensitive to the actual and future expected level of long-term U.S. interest rates. If interest rates fall, our ULSG Target increases. Likewise, if interest rates rise, our ULSG Target declines. Given this profile, we maintain a dedicated interest rate risk mitigation program, composed of interest rate derivatives (the “ULSG Hedge Program”), which we may rebalance periodically to preserve a risk mitigation profile consistent with our objectives. The ULSG Hedge Program prioritizes the ULSG Target (comprised of ULSG CFT and statutory considerations), with less emphasis on mitigating GAAP net income volatility. This could increase the period-to-period volatility of net income and equity due to differences in the sensitivity of the ULSG Target and GAAP liabilities to the changes in interest rates. This mitigation strategy enables us to better protect statutory capitalization of BRCD from potential losses due to an increase in our ULSG Target under lower interest rate conditions. Conversely, we may allow for lower realization of gains as the ULSG Target declines in moderately rising interest rate environments, in order to limit the cost of this risk mitigation strategy. We intend to maintain an adequate amount of liquid investments in our investment portfolio supporting our ULSG book to support any contingent collateral posting requirements from our ULSG Hedge Program.
We closely monitor the sensitivity of our ULSG Assets and ULSG Target to changes in interest rates. We seek to maintain ULSG Assets above the ULSG Target across a wide range of interest rate scenarios. At December 31, 2018, BRCD assets exceed the ULSG CFT requirement. In addition, our hedge portfolio is designed to help us maintain ULSG Assets above the ULSG Target when interest rates decline. 
The following table shows the sensitivity of GAAP net income, on a post-tax basis, due to the ULSG hedging strategy, representing instantaneous changes in interest rates. GAAP ULSG policy reserves are relatively insensitive to interest rate movements. As a result, the sensitivity of ULSG GAAP net income largely consists of changes in the fair value of the ULSG Hedge Program, as depicted in the following table as of December 31, 2018.

 | Estimated at December 31, 2018
 | Interest Rates

The preceding sensitivities discussed in this section are estimates and are not intended to predict the future financial performance of our ULSG Hedge Program or to represent an opinion of market value. They were selected for illustrative purposes only and they do not purport to encompass all of the many factors that may bear upon a market value and are based on a series of assumptions as to the future. It should be recognized that actual future results may differ from those shown, on account of changes in the operating and economic environments and natural variations in experience. The results shown are presented as of December 31, 2018 and no assurance can be given that future experience will be in line with the assumptions made.
Reinsurance Activity
In connection with our risk management efforts and in order to provide opportunities for growth and capital management, we enter into reinsurance arrangements pursuant to which we cede certain insurance risks to unaffiliated reinsurers (“Unaffiliated Third-Party Reinsurance”). We discuss below our use of Unaffiliated Third-Party Reinsurance, as well as the cession of a block of legacy insurance liabilities to a third party and related indemnification and assignment arrangements.
Unaffiliated Third-Party Reinsurance
We cede risks to third parties in order to limit losses, minimize exposure to significant risks and provide capacity for future growth. We enter into various agreements with reinsurers that cover groups of risks, as well as individual risks. Our ceded reinsurance to third parties is primarily structured on a treaty basis as coinsurance, yearly renewable term, excess or catastrophe excess of retention insurance. These reinsurance arrangements are an important part of our risk management strategy because they permit us to spread risk and minimize the effect of losses. The extent of each risk retained by us depends on our evaluation of the specific risk, subject, in certain circumstances, to maximum retention limits based on the characteristics and relative cost of reinsurance. We also cede first dollar mortality risk under certain contracts. In addition to reinsuring mortality risk, we cede other risks, as well as specific coverages. 
Under the terms of the reinsurance agreements, the reinsurer agrees to reimburse us for the ceded amount in the event that we pay a claim. Cessions under reinsurance agreements do not discharge our obligations as the primary insurer. In the event the reinsurers do not meet their obligations under the terms of the reinsurance agreements, reinsurance recoverable balances could become uncollectible. 
27

We have historically reinsured the mortality risk on our life insurance policies primarily on an excess of retention basis or on a quota share basis. When we cede risks to a reinsurer on an excess of retention basis we retain the liability up to a contractually specified amount and the reinsurer is responsible for indemnifying us for amounts in excess of the liability we retain, subject sometimes to a cap. When we cede risks on a quota share basis we share a portion of the risk within a contractually specified layer of reinsurance coverage. We reinsure on a facultative basis for risks with specified characteristics. On a case by case basis, we may retain up to $20 million per life and reinsure 100% of the risk in excess of $20 million. We also reinsure portions of the risk associated with certain whole life policies to a former affiliate and we assume certain term life policies and universal life policies with secondary death benefit guarantees issued by a former affiliate. We routinely evaluate our reinsurance program and may increase or decrease our retention at any time.
Our reinsurance is diversified with a group of well-capitalized, highly rated reinsurers. We analyze recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes, if any, with our reinsurers. We monitor ratings and evaluate the financial strength of our reinsurers by analyzing their financial statements. In addition, the reinsurance recoverable balance due from each reinsurer is evaluated as part of the overall monitoring process. Recoverability of reinsurance recoverable balances is evaluated based on these analyses. We generally secure large reinsurance recoverable balances with various forms of collateral, including secured trusts, funds withheld accounts and irrevocable letters of credit. 
We reinsure, through 100% quota share reinsurance agreements, certain run-off long-term care and workers’ compensation business that we have originally written. For products in our Run-off segment other than ULSG, we have periodically engaged in reinsurance activities on an opportunistic basis.
The following table presents our ordinary course net reinsurance recoverables from unaffiliated third-party reinsurers as of December 31, 2018.

 In addition, in 2000, a block of long-term care policies was sold to Genworth Life Insurance Company and Genworth Life Insurance Company of New York in an indemnity reinsurance transaction with a reinsurance recoverable of $6.6 billion at December 31, 2018. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business — If the counterparties to our reinsurance or indemnification arrangements or to the derivatives we use to hedge our business risks default or fail to perform, we may be exposed to risks we had sought to mitigate, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.” The most currently available financial strength rating is B- for both of these Genworth insurance companies.
Affiliated Reinsurance
28

Affiliated reinsurance companies are affiliated insurance companies licensed under specific provisions of insurance law of their respective jurisdictions, such as the Special Purpose Financial Captive law adopted by several states including Delaware. Our reinsurance subsidiary, BRCD, was formed to manage our capital and risk exposures and to support our various operations, through the use of affiliated reinsurance arrangements and related reserve financing. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business — We may not be able to take credit for reinsurance, our statutory life insurance reserve financings may be subject to cost increases and new financings may be subject to limited market capacity” and “Regulation — Insurance Regulation.”
Catastrophe Coverage
We have exposure to catastrophes which could contribute to significant fluctuations in our results of operations. We use excess of retention and quota share reinsurance agreements to provide greater diversification of risk and minimize exposure to larger risks. 
Sales Distribution
We distribute our annuity and life insurance products through a diverse network of independent distribution partners. Our partners include over 400 national and regional brokerage firms, banks, other financial institutions and financial planners, in connection with the sale of our annuity products, and general agencies, financial advisors, brokerage general agencies and financial intermediaries, in connection with the distribution of our life insurance products. We believe this strategy will permit us to maximize penetration of our target markets and distribution partners without incurring the fixed costs of maintaining a proprietary distribution channel and will facilitate our ability to quickly comply with evolving regulatory requirements applicable to the sale of our products. We discuss below the execution of our strategy, certain key strategic distribution relationships and data with respect to the relative importance of our distribution channels.
Execution of our Strategy - Increasing Penetration
It is fundamental to our distribution strategy that we be among the most important manufacturers to each of our most productive distribution partners. Our objective is to be one of the top annuity and life insurance product manufacturers for our strategic and focus distribution partners. In furtherance of our strategy, we seek to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by providing our most productive distributors with focused product, sales and technology support through our approximately 20 strategic relationship managers (“SRMs”) and in excess of 200 internal and external wholesalers.
Strategic Relationship Managers
Our SRMs serve as the principal contact for our largest annuity and life insurance distributors and coordinate the relationship between Brighthouse and the distributor. SRMs provide an enhanced level of service to partners that require more resources to support their larger distribution network. SRMs are responsible for tracking and providing our key distributors with sales and activity data. They participate in business planning sessions with our distributors and are critical in providing us with insights into the product design, education and other support requirements of our principal distributors. They are also responsible for addressing proactively relationship issues with our distributors.
Wholesalers
Our wholesalers are licensed sales representatives who are responsible for providing our distributors with product support and facilitating the ease with which our distributors and customers do business with us. Our wholesalers are organized into internal wholesalers and external wholesalers. Approximately 100 of our wholesalers, which we refer to as internal wholesalers, support our distributors from our Charlotte, North Carolina corporate center where they are responsible for providing telephonic and online sales support functions. Our approximately 100 field sales representatives, which we refer to as external wholesalers, are responsible for providing on site face-to-face product and sales support to our distributors. The external wholesalers generally have responsibility for a specific geographic region. In addition, we also have wholesalers dedicated to Primerica and MassMutual.
Strategic Distribution Relationships
We distribute our annuity products through a broad geographic network of over 400 independent distribution partners including wire houses, which we group into distribution channels including national brokerage firms, regional brokerage firms, banks and other financial institutions and independent financial planners. Our annuity distribution relationships have an average tenure in excess of 10 years.
Relative Channel Importance and Related Data
Our annuity and life insurance products are distributed through a diverse network of distribution relationships. In the tables below, we show the relative percentage of new premium production by our principal distribution channels for our annuity and life insurance products.

Overview
Our life insurance companies are regulated primarily at the state level, with some products and services also subject to federal regulation. In addition, BHF and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation under the insurance holding company laws of various U.S. jurisdictions. Furthermore, some of our operations, products and services are subject to ERISA, consumer protection laws, securities, broker-dealer and investment advisor regulations, and environmental and unclaimed property laws and regulations. See “Risk Factors — Regulatory and Legal Risks.” 
Insurance Regulation
State insurance regulation generally aims at supervising and regulating insurers, with the goal of protecting policyholders and ensuring that insurance companies remain solvent. Insurance regulators have increasingly sought information about the potential impact of activities in holding company systems as a whole and have adopted laws and regulations enhancing “group-wide” supervision. See “— Holding Company Regulation” for information regarding an enterprise risk report. 
Each of our insurance subsidiaries is licensed and regulated in each U.S. jurisdiction where it conducts insurance business. Brighthouse Life Insurance Company is licensed to issue insurance products in all U.S. states (except New York), the District of Columbia, the Bahamas, Guam, Puerto Rico, the British Virgin Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands. BHNY is only licensed to issue insurance products in New York, and NELICO is licensed in all U.S. states and the District of Columbia. The primary regulator of an insurance company, however, is the insurance regulator in its state of domicile. Our insurance subsidiaries, Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, BHNY and NELICO, are domiciled in Delaware, New York and Massachusetts, respectively, and regulated by the Delaware Department of Insurance, the New York State Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”) and the Massachusetts Division of Insurance, respectively. In addition, BRCD, which provides reinsurance to our insurance subsidiaries, is domiciled in Delaware and regulated by the Delaware Department of Insurance. 
The extent of such regulation varies, but most jurisdictions have laws and regulations governing the financial aspects and business conduct of insurers. State laws in the U.S. grant insurance regulatory authorities broad administrative powers with respect to, among other things: 

• | licensing companies and agents to transact business;


• | calculating the value of assets to determine compliance with statutory requirements;


• | mandating certain insurance benefits;


• | regulating certain premium rates;


• | reviewing and approving certain policy forms and rates;


• | regulating unfair trade and claims practices, including through the imposition of restrictions on marketing and sales practices, distribution arrangements and payment of inducements, and identifying and paying to the states benefits and other property that are not claimed by the owners;


• | regulating advertising and marketing of insurance products;


• | protecting privacy;


• | establishing statutory capital (including RBC) reserve requirements and solvency standards;


• | specifying the conditions under which a ceding company can take credit for reinsurance in its statutory financial statements (i.e., reduce its reserves by the amount of reserves ceded to a reinsurer);


• | fixing maximum interest rates on insurance policy loans and minimum rates for guaranteed crediting rates on life insurance policies and annuity contracts;


• | adopting and enforcing suitability standards with respect to the sale of annuities and other insurance products;


• | approving changes in control of insurance companies;


• | restricting the payment of dividends and other transactions between affiliates; and


• | regulating the types, amounts and valuation of investments.

32

Each insurance subsidiary is required to file reports, generally including detailed annual financial statements, with insurance regulatory authorities in each of the jurisdictions in which it does business, and its operations and accounts are subject to periodic examination by such authorities. These subsidiaries must also file, and in many jurisdictions and for some lines of insurance obtain regulatory approval for, rules, rates and forms relating to the insurance written in the jurisdictions in which they operate. 
State and federal insurance and securities regulatory authorities and other state law enforcement agencies and attorneys general from time to time may make inquiries regarding our compliance with insurance, securities and other laws and regulations regarding the conduct of our insurance and securities businesses. We cooperate with such inquiries and take corrective action when warranted. See Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.
Holding Company Regulation
Insurance holding company laws and regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but generally require a controlled insurance company (i.e., insurers that are subsidiaries of insurance holding companies) to register with state regulatory authorities and to file with those authorities certain reports, including information concerning its capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain intercompany transactions and general business operations. The NAIC adopted revisions to the NAIC Insurance Holding Company System Model Act (“Model Holding Company Act”) and the Insurance Holding Company System Model Regulation (“Model Holding Company Regulation”) in December 2010 and December 2014. Certain of the states, including Delaware, have adopted insurance holding company laws and regulations in a substantially similar manner to the model law and regulation. Other states, including New York and Massachusetts, have adopted modified versions, although their supporting regulation is substantially similar to the model regulation.
Insurance holding company regulations generally provide that no person, corporation or other entity may acquire control of an insurance company, or a controlling interest in any parent company of an insurance company, without the prior approval of such insurance company’s domiciliary state insurance regulator. Under the laws of each of the domiciliary states of our insurance subsidiaries, any person acquiring, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting securities of an insurance company is presumed to have acquired “control” of the company. This statutory presumption of control may be rebutted by a showing that control does not exist in fact. The state insurance regulators, however, may find that “control” exists in circumstances in which a person owns or controls less than 10% of voting securities. 
The laws and regulations regarding acquisition of control transactions may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change of control involving us, including through unsolicited transactions that some of our shareholders might consider desirable.
The insurance company laws and regulations include a requirement that the ultimate controlling person of a U.S. insurer file an annual enterprise risk report with the lead state of the insurance holding company system identifying risks likely to have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition or liquidity of the insurer or its insurance holding company system as a whole. To date, all of the states where Brighthouse has domestic insurers have enacted this enterprise risk reporting requirement.
State insurance statutes also typically place restrictions and limitations on the amount of dividends or other distributions payable by insurance subsidiaries to their parent companies, as well as on transactions between an insurer and its affiliates. Dividends in excess of prescribed limits and transactions above a specified size between an insurer and its affiliates require the approval of the insurance regulator in the insurer’s state of domicile. 
Under the Delaware Insurance Code, Brighthouse Life Insurance Company is permitted, without prior insurance regulatory clearance, to pay a stockholder dividend as long as the amount of the dividend when aggregated with all other dividends paid in the preceding 12 months does not exceed the greater of: (i) 10% of its surplus to policyholders as of the end of the immediately preceding calendar year; or (ii) its statutory net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year (excluding realized capital gains), not including pro rata distributions of Brighthouse Life Insurance Company’s own securities. Brighthouse Life Insurance Company will be permitted to pay a stockholder dividend in excess of the greater of such two amounts only if it files notice of the declaration of such a dividend and the amount thereof with the Delaware Commissioner and the Delaware Commissioner either approves the distribution of the dividend or does not disapprove the distribution within 30 days of its filing. In addition, any dividend that exceeds earned surplus (defined as “unassigned funds (surplus)”) as of the immediately preceding calendar year requires insurance regulatory approval. Under the Delaware Insurance Code, the Delaware Commissioner has broad discretion in determining whether the financial condition of a stock life insurance company would support the payment of such dividends to its stockholders.
33

Under the Massachusetts State Insurance Law, NELICO is permitted, without prior insurance regulatory clearance, to pay a stockholder dividend as long as the aggregate amount of the dividend, when aggregated with all other dividends paid in the preceding 12 months, does not exceed the greater of: (i) 10% of its surplus to policyholders as of the end of the immediately preceding calendar year; or (ii) its statutory net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year, not including pro rata distributions of NELICO’s own securities. NELICO will be permitted to pay a dividend in excess of the greater of such two amounts only if it files notice of the declaration of such a dividend and the amount thereof with the Massachusetts Commissioner of Insurance (the “Massachusetts Commissioner”) and the Massachusetts Commissioner either approves the distribution of the dividend or does not disapprove the distribution within 30 days of its filing. In addition, any dividend that exceeds earned surplus (defined as “unassigned funds (surplus)”) as of the last filed annual statutory statement requires insurance regulatory approval. Under the Massachusetts State Insurance Law, the Massachusetts Commissioner has broad discretion in determining whether the financial condition of a stock life insurance company would support the payment of such dividends to its stockholders.
Effective for dividends paid during 2016 and going forward, the New York Insurance Law was amended permitting BHNY, without prior insurance regulatory clearance, to pay stockholder dividends to its parent in any calendar year based on either of two standards. Under one standard, BHNY is permitted, without prior insurance regulatory clearance, to pay dividends out of earned surplus (defined as positive “unassigned funds (surplus)”), excluding 85% of the change in net unrealized capital gains or losses (less capital gains tax), for the immediately preceding calendar year), in an amount up to the greater of: (i) 10% of its surplus to policyholders as of the end of the immediately preceding calendar year, or (ii) its statutory net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year (excluding realized capital gains), not to exceed 30% of surplus to policyholders as of the end of the immediately preceding calendar year. In addition, under this standard, BHNY may not, without prior insurance regulatory clearance, pay any dividends in any calendar year immediately following a calendar year for which its net gain from operations, excluding realized capital gains, was negative. Under the second standard, if dividends are paid out of other than earned surplus, BHNY may, without prior insurance regulatory clearance, pay an amount up to the lesser of: (i) 10% of its surplus to policyholders as of the end of the immediately preceding calendar year, or (ii) its statutory net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year (excluding realized capital gains). In addition, BHNY will be permitted to pay a dividend to its parent in excess of the amounts allowed under both standards only if it files notice of its intention to declare such a dividend and the amount thereof with the New York Superintendent of Financial Services (the “Superintendent”) and the Superintendent either approves the distribution of the dividend or does not disapprove the dividend within 30 days of its filing. Under New York Insurance Law, the Superintendent has broad discretion in determining whether the financial condition of a stock life insurance company would support the payment of such dividends to its stockholders.
Under BRCD’s plan of operations, no dividend or distribution may be made by BRCD without the prior approval of the Delaware Commissioner. During the year ended December 31, 2017, BRCD paid an extraordinary cash dividend of $535 million to Brighthouse Life Insurance Company.
See “Risk Factors — Capital-Related Risks — As a holding company, BHF depends on the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends.” See also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — The Parent Company — Primary Sources of Liquidity and Capital — Dividends and Returns of Capital from Insurance Subsidiaries” for further information regarding such limitations.
34

Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Model Act
In September 2012, the NAIC adopted the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Model Act (“ORSA”), which has been enacted by our insurance subsidiaries’ domiciliary states. ORSA requires that insurers maintain a risk management framework and conduct an internal own risk and solvency assessment of the insurer’s material risks in normal and stressed environments. The assessment must be documented in a confidential annual summary report, a copy of which must be made available to regulators as required or upon request. To date, all of the states where Brighthouse has domestic insurers have enacted ORSA.
Federal Initiatives
Although the insurance business in the United States is primarily regulated by the states, federal initiatives often have an impact on our business in a variety of ways. From time to time, federal measures are proposed which may significantly and adversely affect the insurance business. These areas include financial services regulation, securities regulation, derivatives regulation, pension regulation, privacy, tort reform legislation and taxation. In addition, various forms of direct and indirect federal regulation of insurance have been proposed from time to time, including proposals for the establishment of an optional federal charter for insurance companies. See “Risk Factors — Regulatory and Legal Risks — Our insurance business is highly regulated, and changes in regulation and in supervisory and enforcement policies may materially impact our capitalization or cash flows, reduce our profitability and limit our growth.” 
One such initiative is 2010’s Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”), which effected the most far-reaching overhaul of financial regulation in the U.S. in decades. Dodd-Frank established the Federal Insurance Office (“FIO”) within the Department of the Treasury, which has the authority to participate in the negotiations of international insurance agreements with foreign regulators for the United States, as well as to collect information about the insurance industry, negotiate covered agreements with one or more foreign governments and recommend prudential standards. While the FIO does not have general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance, it performs various functions with respect to insurance, including serving as a non-voting member of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) and making recommendations to the FSOC regarding which insurers should be subject to more stringent standards as systemically important financial institutions. 
Dodd-Frank established a new insolvency regime that, under certain circumstances, financial institutions such as Brighthouse would be compelled to undergo liquidation with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) as receiver. This new regime, however, did not change existing state laws requiring an insurance company, such as Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, BHNY or NELICO, that becomes insolvent or is in danger of defaulting on its insurance obligations to be rehabilitated or liquidated with the state’s insurance regulator appointed as receiver. In an FDIC-managed liquidation, the holders of such company’s debt could in certain respects be treated differently than they would be had the liquidation occurred under the Bankruptcy Code. As required by Dodd-Frank, the FDIC has established rules relating to the priority of creditors’ claims and the potentially dissimilar treatment of similarly situated creditors. These provisions could apply to some financial institutions whose outstanding debt securities we hold in our investment portfolios.
On September 22, 2017, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative entered into a bilateral covered agreement on insurance and reinsurance with the European Union (the “Covered Agreement”), which addresses, among other things, reinsurance collateral requirements and insurance group supervision. In connection with the announcement of its signature, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative released a “Statement of the United States on the Covered Agreement with the European Union” (the “Policy Statement”). To comply with the terms of the Covered Agreement, the Policy Statement encourages each U.S. state to adopt applicable credit for reinsurance laws and regulations and to phase out the amount of collateral required for full credit for reinsurance cessions to European Union (“EU”) reinsurers. It also states that the U.S. expects that the group capital calculation under development by the NAIC will satisfy the Covered Agreement’s group capital assessment requirement. The Covered Agreement is to be fully applicable to the U.S. and the EU 60 months after signature. However, some parts of the agreement are subject to further procedural requirements, and so full implementation of the Covered Agreement may occur, if at all, only after a significant period of time. In anticipation of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU (commonly referred to as “Brexit”), on December 18, 2018, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative entered into a substantially similar bilateral covered agreement on insurance and reinsurance with the United Kingdom and released a similar policy statement.
Guaranty Associations and Similar Arrangements
Most of the jurisdictions in which we are admitted to transact business require life insurers doing business within the jurisdiction to participate in guaranty associations, which are organized to pay contractual benefits owed pursuant to insurance policies issued by impaired, insolvent or failed insurers, or those that may become impaired, insolvent or fail, for example, 
35

following the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events. These associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on all member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the proportionate share of the premiums written by member insurers in the lines of business in which the impaired, insolvent or failed insurer is engaged. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets. 
In December 2017, the NAIC approved revisions to its Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association Model Act governing assessments for long-term care insurance. The revisions broaden the assessment base for long-term care insurance insolvencies to include both life and health insurers, provide for the inclusion of HMOs in the assessment base, and include no change to the premium tax offset. Several states are now considering legislation to codify these changes into law, and more states are expected to consider legislation in their 2019 legislative sessions.
In the past five years, the aggregate assessments levied against us have not been material. We have established liabilities for guaranty fund assessments that we consider adequate. See “Risk Factors — Regulatory and Legal Risks — State insurance guaranty associations” and Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information on the guaranty association assessments.
Insurance Regulatory Examinations and Other Activities
As part of their regulatory oversight process, state insurance departments conduct periodic detailed examinations of the books, records, accounts, and business practices of insurers domiciled in their states. State insurance departments also have the authority to conduct examinations of non-domiciliary insurers that are licensed in their states. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, BHNY and NELICO did not receive any material adverse findings resulting from state insurance department examinations of them or their respective insurance subsidiaries.
Regulatory authorities in a small number of states, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”) and, occasionally, the SEC, have had investigations or inquiries relating to sales and/or administration of individual life insurance policies, annuities or other products by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, BHNY and NELICO. These investigations have focused on the conduct of particular financial services representatives, the sale of unregistered or unsuitable products, the misuse of client assets, and sales and replacements of annuities and certain riders on such annuities. Over the past several years, these and a number of investigations by other regulatory authorities were resolved for monetary payments and certain other relief, including restitution payments. We may continue to receive, and may resolve, further investigations and actions on these matters in a similar manner. 
In addition, claims payment practices by insurance companies have received increased scrutiny from regulators. See Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for further information regarding unclaimed property inquiries and related litigation and sales practices claims.
Policy and Contract Reserve Adequacy Analysis
Annually, our insurance subsidiaries, including BRCD, are required to conduct an analysis of the adequacy of all statutory reserves. In each case, a qualified actuary must submit an opinion which states that the statutory reserves make adequate provision, according to accepted actuarial standards of practice, for the anticipated cash flows required by the contractual obligations and related expenses of the insurance subsidiary. The adequacy of the statutory reserves is considered in light of the assets held by the insurer with respect to such reserves and related actuarial items including, but not limited to, the investment earnings on such assets, and the consideration anticipated to be received and retained under the related policies and contracts. An insurance company may increase reserves in order to submit an opinion without qualification. Since the inception of this requirement, our insurance subsidiaries, which are required by their states of domicile to provide these opinions, have provided such opinions without qualifications.
NAIC
The NAIC is an organization, whose mission is to assist state insurance regulatory authorities in serving the public interest and achieving the insurance regulatory goals of its members, the state insurance regulatory officials. Through the NAIC, state insurance regulators establish standards and best practices, conduct peer reviews, and coordinate their regulatory oversight. The NAIC provides standardized insurance industry accounting and reporting guidance through its Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual (the “Manual”), which states have largely adopted by regulation. However, statutory accounting principles continue to be established by individual state laws, regulations and permitted practices, which may differ from the Manual. Changes to the Manual or modifications by the various states may impact our statutory capital and surplus.
In 2015, the NAIC commissioned an initiative to identify changes to the statutory framework for variable annuities that can remove or mitigate the motivation for insurers to engage in captive reinsurance transactions. In September 2015, a third-party consultant engaged by the NAIC provided the NAIC with a preliminary report identifying motivations for using variable 
36

annuity captives. In August 2016, the third-party consultant released several sets of recommendations regarding AG 43 and Life Risk Based Capital Phase II Instructions (“RBC C3 Phase II”) reserve requirements. These recommendations generally focus on (i) mitigating the asset-liability accounting mismatch between hedge instruments and statutory instruments and statutory liabilities, (ii) removing the non-economic volatility in statutory capital charges and the resulting solvency ratios and (iii) facilitating greater harmonization across insurers and their products for greater comparability. After considering recommendations from the third-party consultant and industry, the NAIC requested the third-party consultant to undertake a study to evaluate and parameterize the recommended structural revisions further. That work occurred between February and October 2017, and in December 2017, the third-party consultant issued a report containing 28 recommended revisions to AG 43 and RBC C3 Phase II reserve requirements. Over the next few months, the NAIC held multiple public conference calls to allow state insurance regulators, industry representatives, actuaries and the third-party consultant to discuss and refine the proposed recommendations. In July 2018, the regulators on the NAIC working group and committee overseeing the revised framework proposal reached consensus on the proposed recommendations and presented such revisions for adoption by the NAIC Executive and Plenary (the “Plenary”), a body comprised of all U.S. state insurance commissioners and the NAIC Executive Committee. On August 7, 2018 the Plenary formally approved the revised framework proposal as amended by the regulators during their discussion. Since adoption by the Plenary, other NAIC working groups and task forces have been working on drafting specific revisions to AG 43 and RBC C3 Phase II reserve requirements in order to implement the agreed-upon recommendations. The adopted framework will apply to all of our existing variable annuity business and may materially change the sensitivity of reserve and capital requirements to capital markets including interest rate, equity markets and volatility, our estimates of which historically did not reflect the impact of variable annuity capital reform or changes in tax rates, as well as prescribed assumptions for policyholder behavior. Since the implementation details are very early in their development, it is not possible to predict what impacts this reform will have on current risk mitigation and hedging programs. See “Risk Factors — Risk Related to Our Business — Our analyses of scenarios and sensitivities utilized in connection with our variable annuity risk management strategies involve significant estimates based on assumptions that may result in material differences from actual outcomes compared to the sensitivities calculated under such scenarios” and “Risk Factors — Regulatory and Legal Risks — Our insurance business is highly regulated, and changes in regulation and in supervisory and enforcement policies may materially impact our capitalization or cash flows, reduce our profitability and limit our growth.”
In addition, following the reduction in the statutory tax rate pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), the NAIC reviewed the methodology by which taxes are incorporated into the RBC calculation. On August 7, 2018 the NAIC Plenary adopted changes to the RBC calculation effective December 31, 2018 to reflect the lower statutory tax rate, which resulted in a reduction to our insurance subsidiaries’ RBC ratios. As of the date of the most recent annual statutory financial statements filed with insurance regulators, the TAC of each of our insurance subsidiaries was in excess of RBC levels required by regulators.
The NAIC has adopted a new approach for the calculation of life insurance reserves, known as principle-based reserving (“PBR”). PBR became operative on January 1, 2017 in those states where it has been adopted, to be followed by a three-year phase-in period for business issued on or after this date. With respect to the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, the Delaware Department of Insurance implemented PBR on January 1, 2017, and New York enacted legislation adopting PBR in December 2018. At the same time, the NYDFS adopted a temporary regulation to implement PBR while it develops a final regulation. PBR legislation was signed into law in Massachusetts in January 2019. See “Risk Factors — Regulatory and Legal Risks — Our insurance business is highly regulated, and changes in regulation and in supervisory and enforcement policies may materially impact our capitalization or cash flows, reduce our profitability and limit our growth.”
The NAIC is considering revisions to RBC factors for bonds and real estate, as well as developing RBC charges for longevity risk. We cannot predict the impact of any potential proposals that may result from these studies.
We can give no assurances that any of our expectations will be met regarding the capital and reserve impacts or compliance costs, if any, that may result from the above initiatives.
37

Surplus and Capital; Risk-Based Capital
The NAIC has established regulations that provide minimum capitalization requirements based on RBC formulas for insurance companies. Insurers are required to maintain their capital and surplus at or above minimum levels. Regulators have discretionary authority, in connection with the continued licensing of an insurer, to limit or prohibit the insurer’s sales to policyholders if, in their judgment, the regulators determine that such insurer has not maintained the minimum surplus or capital or that the further transaction of business will be hazardous to policyholders. Each of our insurance subsidiaries is subject to RBC requirements and other minimum statutory capital and surplus requirements imposed under the laws of its respective jurisdiction of domicile. RBC is based on a formula calculated by applying factors to various asset, premium, claim, expense and statutory reserve items. The formula takes into account the risk characteristics of the insurer and is calculated on an annual basis. The major categories of risk involved are asset risk, insurance risk, interest rate risk, market risk and business risk, including equity, interest rate and expense recovery risks associated with variable annuities that contain guaranteed minimum death and living benefits. The RBC framework is used as an early warning regulatory tool to identify possible inadequately capitalized insurers for purposes of initiating regulatory action, and not as a means to rank insurers generally. State insurance laws provide insurance regulators the authority to require various actions by, or take various actions against, insurers whose TAC does not meet or exceed certain RBC levels. As of the date of the most recent annual statutory financial statements filed with insurance regulators, the TAC of each of our insurance subsidiaries was in excess of each of those RBC levels. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Risk Factors — Regulatory and Legal Risks — A decrease in the RBC ratio (as a result of a reduction in statutory surplus and/or increase in RBC requirements) of our insurance subsidiaries could result in increased scrutiny by insurance regulators and rating agencies and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.”
Regulation of Investments
Each of our insurance subsidiaries is subject to state laws and regulations that require diversification of investment portfolios and limits the amount of investments that an insurer may have in certain asset categories, such as below investment grade fixed income securities, real estate equity, other equity investments, and derivatives. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations would cause investments exceeding regulatory limitations to be treated as non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring surplus and, in some instances, would require divestiture of such non-qualifying investments. We believe that the investments made by each of our insurance subsidiaries complied, in all material respects, with such regulations at December 31, 2018.
NYDFS Insurance Regulation 210
On March 19, 2018, NYDFS Insurance Regulation 210: Life Insurance and Annuity Non-Guaranteed Elements took effect. The regulation establishes standards for the determination and readjustment of non-guaranteed elements (“NGEs”) that may vary at the insurer’s discretion for life insurance policies and annuity contracts delivered or issued in New York. In addition, the regulation establishes guidelines for related disclosure to NYDFS and policy owners prior to any adverse change in NGEs. The regulation applies to all individual life insurance policies, individual annuity contracts and certain group life insurance and group annuity certificates that contain NGEs. NGEs include premiums, expense charges, cost of insurance rates and interest credits.
Cybersecurity Regulation
On February 16, 2017, the NYDFS announced the adoption of a new cybersecurity regulation for financial services institutions, including banking and insurance entities, under its jurisdiction. The new regulation became effective on March 1, 2017 and was implemented in stages. Among other things, this new regulation requires these entities to establish and maintain a cybersecurity program designed to protect consumers’ private data. The new regulation specifically provides for: (i) implementation and maintenance of, and a governance framework for overseeing, the cybersecurity program and a cybersecurity policy based on a risk assessment conducted periodically; (ii) development of access controls and other technology standards for data protection, and the monitoring and testing of the cybersecurity program, in accordance with the entity’s risk assessment; (iii) implementation of policies and procedures designed to ensure the security of private data accessible to or held by third-party service providers; (iv) minimum standards for cyber breach responses, including an incident response plan, preservation of data to respond to such breaches, and notice to NYDFS of material events; and (v) annual certifications of regulatory compliance to the NYDFS. In addition to New York’s cybersecurity regulation, the NAIC adopted the Insurance Data Security Model Law in October 2017. Under the model law, companies that are compliant with the NYDFS cybersecurity regulation are deemed also to be in compliance with the model law. The purpose of the model law is to establish standards for data security and for the investigation and notification of insurance commissioners of cybersecurity events involving unauthorized access to, or the misuse of, certain nonpublic information. A number of states have enacted the model laws and additional states are considering it in 2019.

Department of Labor and ERISA Considerations
We manufacture annuities for third parties to sell to tax-qualified pension plans, retirement plans and retirement accounts and individual retirement annuities (“IRAs”), as well as individual retirement annuities sold to individuals that are subject to the Employee Retirement Security Act (“ERISA”) or the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Tax Code”). Also, a portion of our in-force life insurance products and annuity products are held by tax-qualified pension and retirement plans. While we currently believe manufacturers do not have as much exposure to ERISA and the Tax Code as distributors, certain activities are subject to the restrictions imposed by ERISA and the Tax Code, including the requirement under ERISA that fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Title I of ERISA (an “ERISA Plan”) must perform their duties solely in the interests of the ERISA Plan participants and beneficiaries, and those fiduciaries may not cause a covered plan to engage in certain prohibited transactions. The applicable provisions of ERISA and the Tax Code are subject to enforcement by the Department of Labor (“DOL”), the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (“PBGC”).
In addition, the prohibited transaction rules of ERISA and the Tax Code generally restrict the provision of investment advice to ERISA qualified plans, plan participants and IRA owners if the investment recommendation results in fees paid to an individual advisor, the firm that employs the advisor or their affiliates that vary according to the investment recommendation chosen. Similarly, without an exemption, fiduciary advisors are prohibited from receiving compensation from third parties in connection with their advice. ERISA also affects certain of our in-force insurance policies and annuity contracts, as well as insurance policies and annuity contracts we may sell in the future.
On July 11, 2016, the DOL, the IRS and the PBGC proposed revisions to the Form 5500, the form used for ERISA annual reporting. The DOL included the proposed revisions in its Fall 2017 regulatory agenda released December 14, 2017. The revisions affect employee pension and welfare benefit plans, including our ERISA plans and require audits of information, self-directed brokerage account disclosure requirements and additional extensive disclosure. Efforts to finalize the proposed revisions have been suspended. We cannot predict the effect these proposals, if enacted, will have on our business, or what other proposals may be made, what legislation may be introduced or enacted or the impact of any such legislation on our results of operations and financial condition.
In addition, the DOL has issued a number of regulations that increase the level of disclosure that must be provided to plan sponsors and participants. The participant disclosure regulations and the regulations which require service providers to disclose fee and other information to plan sponsors took effect in 2012.
In John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company v. Harris Trust and Savings Bank (1993), the U.S. Supreme Court held that certain assets in excess of amounts necessary to satisfy guaranteed obligations under a participating group annuity general account contract are “plan assets.” Therefore, these assets are subject to certain fiduciary obligations under ERISA, which requires fiduciaries to perform their duties solely in the interest of ERISA plan participants and beneficiaries. On January 5, 2000, the Secretary of Labor issued final regulations indicating, in cases where an insurer has issued a policy backed by the insurer’s general account to or for an employee benefit plan, the extent to which assets of the insurer constitute plan assets for purposes of ERISA and the Tax Code. The regulations apply only with respect to a policy issued by an insurer on or before December 31, 1998 (“Transition Policy”). No person will generally be liable under ERISA or the Tax Code for conduct occurring prior to July 5, 2001, where the basis of a claim is that insurance company general account assets constitute plan assets. An insurer issuing a new policy that is backed by its general account and is issued to or for an employee benefit plan after December 31, 1998 will generally be subject to fiduciary obligations under ERISA, unless the policy is a guaranteed benefit policy.
The regulations indicate the requirements that must be met so that assets supporting a Transition Policy will not be considered plan assets for purposes of ERISA and the Tax Code. These requirements include detailed disclosures to be made to the employee benefits plan and the requirement that the insurer must permit the policyholder to terminate the policy on 90 days’ notice and receive without penalty, at the policyholder’s option, either (i) the unallocated accumulated fund balance (which may be subject to market value adjustment), or (ii) a book value payment of such amount in annual installments with interest. We have taken and continue to take steps designed to ensure compliance with these regulations.
Standard of Conduct Regulation
As a result of overlapping efforts by the DOL, the NAIC, individual states, and the SEC to impose fiduciary-like requirements in connection with the sale of annuities and life insurance policies, which are each discussed in more detail below, there have been a number of proposed or adopted changes to the laws and regulations that govern the conduct of our business and the firms that distribute our products. As a manufacturer of annuity and life insurance products, we do not directly distribute our products to consumers. However, regulations establishing standards of conduct regulations in connection with the distribution and sale of these products could affect our business by imposing greater compliance, oversight, disclosure and notification requirements on us. We cannot predict what other proposals may be made, what legislation or regulations may be introduced or enacted, or what impact any future legislation or regulations may have on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See 
39

“Risk Factors — Regulatory and Legal Risks — Our insurance business is highly regulated, and changes in regulation and in supervisory and enforcement policies may materially impact our capitalization or cash flows, reduce our profitability and limit our growth — Standard of Conduct Regulation.”
Department of Labor Fiduciary Rule
The DOL issued regulations on April 6, 2016 that became applicable on June 9, 2017 (the “Fiduciary Rule”) but were subsequently vacated by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals effective June 21, 2018. While the Fiduciary Rule was in effect, it substantially expanded the definition of “investment advice,” thereby broadening the circumstances under which distributors and manufacturers of insurance and annuity products could be considered fiduciaries under ERISA or the Tax Code, and subject to an impartial conduct or “best interests” standard in providing such advice. Under the rule, certain communications with plans, plan participants and IRA owners, including the marketing of products, and marketing of investment management or advisory services, were deemed fiduciary investment advice, thus causing increased exposure to fiduciary liability if the distributor did not recommend what was in the client’s best interests. It is uncertain whether the DOL will propose new investment advice fiduciary regulations to replace the nullified Fiduciary Rule.
State Law Standard of Conduct Rules and Regulations
The NAIC, as well as certain state regulators, are also considering implementing regulations that would apply an impartial conduct standard to recommendations made in connection with certain annuities and, in the case of New York, life insurance policies. In particular, on July 18, 2018, the NYDFS issued a final version of Regulation 187 (“Regulation 187”), which adopts a “best interest” standard for the sale of life insurance and annuity products in New York. The regulation generally requires a consumer’s best interest, and not the financial interests of a producer or insurer, to influence a producer’s recommendation as to which life insurance or annuity product a consumer should purchase. In addition, Regulation 187 imposes a best interest standard on certain consumer in-force transactions. Regulation 187 will become effective for annuity products on August 1, 2019 and for life insurance products on February 1, 2020. We are continuing to assess the impact of the regulation on our business. The regulation, when implemented, may have adverse effects on our business and consolidated results of operations. In November 2018, the three primary agent groups in New York launched a legal challenge against the NYDFS over the adoption of Regulation 187. It is not possible to predict whether this challenge will be successful.
Proposed SEC Rules Addressing Standards of Conduct for Broker-Dealers
On April 18, 2018, the SEC released a comprehensive set of proposed rules for broker-dealers and investment advisers that would, among other things, (i) enhance the existing standard of conduct for broker-dealers that provide securities recommendations or advice to retail investors to require them to act in the best interest of their clients and mitigate conflicts of interest; (ii) clarify the nature of the fiduciary obligations owed by registered investment advisers to their clients; (iii) impose new disclosure requirements on broker-dealers and investment advisers aimed at ensuring investors understand the nature of their relationship with their investment professionals; and (iv) restrict certain broker-dealers and their financial professionals from using the terms “adviser” or “advisor.” Although the full impact of the proposed rules can only be measured when the implementing regulations are adopted, the intent of the provisions is to impose an enhanced standard of care on broker-dealers which is more similar to that of an investment adviser. Among other things, this would require broker-dealers to mitigate conflicts of interest arising from financial incentives in selling securities products. The SEC projects that the proposal will be finalized by September 2019.
Federal Tax Reform
On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed the Tax Act into law, resulting in sweeping changes to the Tax Code. The Tax Act reduced the corporate tax rate to 21%, limited deductibility of interest expense, increased capitalization amounts for deferred acquisition costs, eliminated the corporate alternative minimum tax, provided for determining reserve deductions as 92.81% of statutory reserves, and reduced the dividend received deduction. Most of the changes in the Tax Act were effective as of January 1, 2018.
Our actual results may materially differ from our current estimate due to, among other things, further guidance that may be issued by U.S. tax authorities or regulatory bodies and/or changes in interpretations and assumptions we have preliminarily made.
Regulation of Over-the-Counter Derivatives
Dodd-Frank includes a framework of regulation of the over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives markets which requires clearing of certain types of derivatives and imposes additional costs, including new reporting and margin requirements, and will likely impose additional regulation on us. Our costs of risk mitigation are increasing under Dodd-Frank. For example, Dodd-Frank imposes requirements for (i) the mandatory clearing of certain derivatives transactions (derivatives that must be cleared and 
40

settled through central clearing counterparties), and (ii) mandatory exchange of margin for “OTC-bilateral” transactions (OTC derivatives that are bilateral contracts between two counterparties) entered into after the applicable phase-in period. The initial margin requirements for OTC-bilateral transactions will be applicable to us in September 2020. The increased margin requirements, combined with increased capital charges for our counterparties and central clearinghouses with respect to non-cash collateral, will likely require increased holdings of cash and highly liquid securities with lower yields causing a reduction in income and less favorable pricing for cleared and OTC-bilateral derivatives transactions. Centralized clearing of certain derivatives exposes us to the risk of a default by a clearing member or clearinghouse with respect to our cleared derivative transactions. We use derivatives to mitigate a wide range of risks in connection with our businesses, including the impact of increased benefit exposures from certain of our annuity products that offer guaranteed benefits. We have always been subject to the risk that hedging and other management procedures might prove ineffective in reducing the risks to which insurance policies expose us or that unanticipated policyholder behavior or mortality, combined with adverse market events, could produce economic losses beyond the scope of the risk management techniques employed. Any such losses could be increased by higher costs of entering into derivative transactions (including customized derivatives) and the reduced availability of customized derivatives that might result from the implementation of Dodd-Frank and comparable international derivatives regulations.
Dodd-Frank also mandated the SEC and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) to study whether “stable value contracts” should be treated as swaps under the Dodd-Frank regulatory framework. Pursuant to the new definition of “swap” and related SEC and CFTC interpretive regulations, products offered by our insurance subsidiaries that are stable value contracts are not currently treated as swaps. Should other products become regulated as swaps, we cannot predict how the rules would be applied to them or the effect on such products’ profitability or attractiveness to our clients.
Federal banking regulators have adopted new rules that apply to certain qualified financial contracts, including many derivatives contracts, securities lending agreements and repurchase agreements, with certain banking institutions and certain of their affiliates. These rules, which became effective on January 1, 2019, generally require the banking institutions and their applicable affiliates to include contractual provisions in their qualified financial contracts that limit or delay certain rights of their counterparties arising in connection with the banking institution or an applicable affiliate becoming subject to a bankruptcy, insolvency, resolution or similar proceeding. To the extent that any of the derivatives, securities lending agreements or repurchase agreements that we enter into are subject to these rules, it could increase our risk or limit our recovery in the event of a default by such banking institutions or their applicable affiliates.
Securities, Broker-Dealer and Investment Advisor Regulation
Some of our activities in offering and selling variable insurance products, as well as certain fixed interest rate contracts, are subject to extensive regulation under the federal securities laws administered by the SEC and/or state securities law. Federal and state securities laws and regulations treat variable annuity contracts, variable life insurance policies, and certain fixed interest rate or index-linked contracts products as securities that must be distributed through registered broker-dealers. In addition, because our variable contracts are required to be sold by broker-dealers that are FINRA members, sales of our variable contracts also are subject to the requirements of FINRA rules. Brighthouse Securities is registered with the SEC as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and approved as a member of, and subject to regulation by, FINRA, and is registered as a broker-dealer in all applicable U.S. states. Its business is to serve as the principal underwriter and exclusive distributor of the SEC-registered life insurance policies and annuity contracts issued by its affiliates, and the principal underwriter of the registered mutual funds advised by its affiliated investment advisor and used to fund variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies. While not required under securities laws, Brighthouse Securities may also distribute other non-variable insurance policies and annuity contracts issued by its affiliates.
We also issue variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies through separate accounts that are registered with the SEC as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). Each registered separate account is generally divided into sub-accounts, each of which invests in an underlying mutual fund which is itself a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act. Another of our subsidiaries is registered as an investment advisor with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and its primary business is to serve as investment advisor to the registered mutual funds that underlie our variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies.
In addition, the variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies issued by these registered separate accounts are registered with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). We also issue fixed interest rate or index-linked contracts with features that require them to be registered as securities under the Securities Act. Certain variable contract separate accounts sponsored by our subsidiaries are exempt from registration under the Securities Act and the Investment Company Act but may be subject to other provisions of the federal securities laws. 
Federal, state and other securities regulatory authorities, including the SEC and FINRA, may from time to time make inquiries and conduct examinations regarding our compliance with securities and other laws and regulations. We will cooperate 
41

with such inquiries and examinations and take corrective action when warranted. See “— Insurance Regulation — Insurance Regulatory Examinations and Other Activities.”
Federal and state securities laws and regulations are primarily intended to ensure the integrity of the financial markets, to protect investors in the securities markets, and to protect investment advisory or brokerage clients, and generally grant regulatory agencies broad rulemaking and enforcement powers, including the power to limit or restrict the conduct of business for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.
Environmental Considerations
As an owner and operator of real property, we are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Inherent in such ownership and operation is also the risk that there may be potential environmental liabilities and costs in connection with any investigation or required remediation of such properties. In addition, we hold equity interests in companies that could potentially be subject to environmental liabilities. We routinely have environmental assessments performed with respect to real estate being acquired for investment and real property to be acquired through foreclosure. We cannot provide assurance that unexpected environmental liabilities will not arise. However, based on information currently available to us, we believe that any costs associated with our compliance with environmental laws and regulations or any remediation of our properties will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
Unclaimed Property
We are subject to the laws and regulations of states and other jurisdictions concerning identification, reporting and escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned funds, and are subject to audit and examination for compliance with these requirements. Litigation may be brought by, or on behalf, of one or more entities, seeking to recover unclaimed or abandoned funds and interest. The claimant or claimants also may allege entitlement to other damages or penalties, including for alleged false claims.
Company Ratings
Financial strength ratings represent the opinion of rating agencies regarding the ability of an insurance company to pay obligations under insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. Credit ratings indicate the rating agency’s opinion regarding a debt issuer’s ability to meet the terms of debt obligations in a timely manner. They are important factors in our overall funding profile and ability to access certain types of liquidity and capital. The level and composition of regulatory capital at the subsidiary level and our equity capital are among the many factors considered in determining our financial strength ratings and credit ratings. Each agency has its own capital adequacy evaluation methodology, and assessments are generally based on a combination of factors. Rating agencies may increase the frequency and scope of their credit reviews, may request additional information from the companies that they rate and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — The Company — Rating Agencies” and “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business — A downgrade or a potential downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could result in a loss of business and materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.”
Competition
Both the annuities and the life insurance markets are very competitive, with many participants and no one company dominating the market for all products. According to the American Council of Life Insurers (Life Insurers Fact Book 2018), the U.S. life insurance industry is made up of 781 companies with sales and operations across the country. We compete with major, well-established stock and mutual life insurance companies in all of our product offerings. Our Annuities segment also faces competition from other financial service providers that focus on retirement products and advice. Our competitive positioning overall is focused on access to distribution channels, product features and financial strength. 
Principal competitive factors in the annuities business include product features, distribution channel relationships, ease of doing business, annual fees, investment performance, speed to market, brand recognition and the financial strength ratings of the insurance company. In particular for the variable annuity business, our living benefit rider product features and the quality of our relationship management and wholesaling support are key drivers in our competitive position. In the fixed annuity business, the crediting rates and guaranteed payout product features are the primary competitive factors, while for index-linked annuities the competitiveness of the crediting methodology is the primary driver. For income annuities, the competitiveness of the lifetime income payment amount is generally the principal factor. 
Principal competitive factors in the life insurance business include customer service and distribution channel relationships, price, the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries and financial stability. For term life, we also focus on our relatively low pricing compared to our competitors, high internal death benefit risk retention and policy conversion guidelines.

Employees
At December 31, 2018, we had approximately 1,260 employees. We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory.
