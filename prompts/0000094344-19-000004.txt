Item 1. Business
Stewart Information Services Corporation (NYSE:STC) is a global real estate services company, incorporated in Delaware in 1970, and offering products and services through our direct operations, network of independent agencies and family of companies. From residential and commercial title insurance and closing and settlement services to specialized offerings for the mortgage industry, we offer the comprehensive service, deep expertise and solutions our customers need for any real estate transaction. We and our predecessors have been engaged in the title business since 1893.
Our international division delivers products and services protecting and promoting private land ownership worldwide. Our primary international operations are in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and Central Europe.
We currently report our business in two segments: title insurance and related services (title), and ancillary services and corporate. Refer to Note 19 to our audited consolidated financial statements and Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) for financial information related to the title and ancillary services and corporate segments.
Merger Agreement
During November 2017, we announced that our Board formed a strategic committee to actively assess a full range of strategic alternatives available to Stewart and that we retained Citi as financial advisor and Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP as legal advisor to assist us in the strategic alternatives review process. During March 2018, Stewart entered into an agreement and plan of merger (merger agreement) with Fidelity National Financial, Inc. (FNF), in which the outstanding shares of Stewart will be exchanged for a combination of cash and shares of FNF, and the Company will be merged into a subsidiary of FNF (the Mergers). After the merger announcement, the parties commenced the regulatory approval process by submitting applicable filings to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the states of Texas and New York, where our two main underwriters are domiciled, and other states and jurisdictions where necessary. 
We continue to work through the regulatory process with FNF to satisfy all of the conditions for closing the Mergers, including those of the FTC, the Texas Department of Insurance (TDI) and the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). We have received approval from a majority of the other states and all of the international jurisdictions we notified about the Mergers. As previously disclosed in a Form 8-K filing, on January 31, 2019, the NYDFS provided written notice of its disapproval of FNF's application to acquire control of Stewart Title Insurance Company, our New York domiciled title insurance underwriter. Stewart and FNF are in the process of reaching out to the NYDFS to discuss the notice and seek to resolve the concerns raised therein, with which we and FNF respectfully disagree.
For details on the merger agreement, refer to Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements.
Title Segment
Title insurance and related services include the functions of searching, examining, closing and insuring the condition of the title to real property. The title segment also includes home and personal insurance services and Internal Revenue Code Section 1031 tax-deferred exchanges.
Examination and closing. The purpose of a title examination is to ascertain the ownership of the property being transferred, debts that are owed on it and the scope of the title policy coverage. This involves searching for and examining documents such as deeds, mortgages, wills, divorce decrees, court judgments, liens, paving assessments and tax records.
At the closing or “settlement” of a sale transaction, the seller executes and delivers a deed to the new owner. The buyer typically signs new mortgage documents. Closing funds are disbursed to the seller, the prior lender, real estate brokers, the title company and others. The documents are then recorded in the public records. A title insurance policy is generally issued to both the new lender and the owner.

Title insurance policies. Lenders in the United States generally require title insurance as a condition to making a loan on real estate, including securitized lending. This is to assure lenders of the priority of their lien position. The purchasers of the property want insurance to protect against claims that may arise against the title to the property. The face amount of the policy is normally the purchase price or the amount of the related loan.
Title insurance is substantially different from other types of insurance. Fire, auto, health and life insurance protect against future losses and events. In contrast, title insurance insures against losses from past events and seeks to protect the public by eliminating covered risks through the examination and settlement process. In essence, subject to its exceptions and exclusions, a title insurance policy provides a warranty to the policyholder that the title to the property is free from defects that might impair ownership rights, or in the case of a lender's policy, that there is priority of lien position. Most other forms of insurance provide protection for a limited period of time and, hence the policy must be periodically renewed. Title insurance, however, is issued for a one-time premium and the policy provides protection for as long as the owner owns the property, or has liability in connection with the property, or a lender under its policy has its insured lien on the property. Also, a title insurance policy does not have a finite contract term, whereas most other lines of insurance have a definite beginning and ending date for coverage. Although a title insurance policy provides protection as long as the owner owns the property being covered, the title insurance company generally does not have information about which policies are still effective. Most other lines of insurance receive periodic premium payments and policy renewals thereby allowing the insurance company to know which policies are effective.
Losses. Losses on policies occur when a title defect is not discovered during the examination and settlement process. Reasons for losses include forgeries, misrepresentations, unrecorded or undiscovered liens, the failure to pay off existing liens, mortgage lending fraud, mishandling or defalcation of settlement funds, issuance by independent agencies of unauthorized coverage and defending policyholders when covered claims are filed against their interest in the property.
Some claimants seek damages in excess of policy limits. Those claims are based on various legal theories. We vigorously defend against spurious claims and provide protection for covered claims up to the limits set forth in the policy. We have from time-to-time incurred losses in excess of policy limits.
Experience shows that most policy claims and claim payments are made in the first six years after the policy has been issued, although claims can also be incurred and paid many years later. By their nature, claims are often complex, vary greatly in dollar amounts and are affected by economic and market conditions and the legal environment existing at the time claims are processed.
Our liability for estimated title losses comprises both known claims and our estimate of claims that may be reported in the future. The amount of our loss reserve represents the aggregate future payments (net of recoveries) that we expect to incur on policy losses and in costs to settle claims. In accordance with industry practice, these amounts have not been discounted to their present values.
Estimating future title loss payments is difficult due to the complex nature of title claims, the length of time over which claims are paid, the significant variance in dollar amounts of individual claims and other factors. The amounts provided for policy losses are based on reported claims, historical loss payment experience, title industry averages and the current legal and economic environment. Estimated provisions for current year policy losses are charged to income in the same year the related premium revenues are recognized. Annual provisions for policy losses also include changes in the estimated aggregate liability on policies issued in prior years. Actual loss payment experience relating to policies issued in previous years, including the impact of large losses, is the primary reason for increases or decreases in our annual loss provision.
Amounts shown as our estimated liability for future loss payments are continually reviewed by us for reasonableness and adjusted as appropriate. We have consistently followed the same basic method of estimating and recording our loss reserves for more than 10 years. As part of our process, we also obtain input from third-party actuaries regarding our methodology and resulting reserve calculations. While we are responsible for determining our loss reserves, we utilize this actuarial input to assess the overall reasonableness of our reserve estimation.
See “Critical Accounting Estimates - Title Loss Reserves” under Item 7 - MD&A for information on current year policy losses and consolidated balance sheet reserves.

Factors affecting revenues. Title insurance revenues are closely related to the level of activity in the real estate markets we serve and the prices at which real estate sales are made. Real estate sales are directly affected by the availability and cost of money to finance purchases. Other factors include consumer confidence and demand by buyers. In periods of low interest rates, loan refinancing transactions are also an important contributor to revenues. These factors may override the seasonal nature of the title business. Generally, our first quarter is the least active and our second and third quarters are the most active in terms of title insurance revenues. Refer to "Industry Data" of Item 7 - MD&A for comparative information on home sales, mortgage interest rates and loan activity.
Customers. The primary sources of title insurance business are attorneys, builders, developers, home buyers and home sellers, lenders, mortgage brokers, and real estate brokers and agents. No individual customer was responsible for as much as 10% or more of our consolidated revenues in any of the last three years. Titles insured include residential and various asset classes of commercial properties, including but not limited to, office, multi family, industrial, retail, undeveloped acreage, farms, ranches, wind and solar power installations and other energy-related projects.
Service, location, financial strength, company size and related factors affect customer acceptance. Increasing market share is accomplished primarily by providing superior service. The parties to a closing are concerned with accuracy, timeliness and cost. The rates charged to customers are regulated, to varying degrees, in most states.
The financial strength and stability of the title underwriter are important factors in maintaining and increasing our business, particularly commercial business. We are rated as investment grade by the title industry’s leading rating companies. Our principal underwriter, Stewart Title Guaranty Company (Guaranty), is currently rated “A” by Demotech Inc., "A-" by Fitch Ratings Ltd., "A-" by A.M. Best and "B+" by Kroll Bond Rating Agency Inc. Similarly, our second largest underwriter, Stewart Title Insurance Company (STIC), is also highly rated by such rating companies.
Market share. Title insurance statistics are compiled quarterly by the title industry’s national trade association. Based on 2018 unconsolidated statutory net premiums written through September 30, 2018, Guaranty is one of the leading title insurers in the United States.
Our largest competitors are FNF, which includes Chicago Title Insurance Company, Fidelity National Title Insurance Company and Commonwealth Land Title Insurance Company; First American Financial Corporation (First American), which includes First American Title Insurance Company; and Old Republic Title Insurance Group (Old Republic), which includes Old Republic National Title Insurance Company. We also compete with other title insurer companies, as well as abstractors, attorneys who issue title opinions and attorney-owned title insurance funds. A number of homebuilders, financial institutions, real estate brokers and others own or control title insurance agencies, some of which issue policies underwritten by Guaranty.
Refer to "Title revenues by geographic location" within the Results of Operations discussion under Item 7 - MD&A for the breakdown of title revenues by major geographic location. 

Regulations. Title insurance companies are subject to comprehensive state regulations covering premium rates, agency licensing, policy forms, trade practices, reserve requirements, investments and the transfer of funds between an insurer and its parent or its subsidiaries and any similar related party transactions. Kickbacks and similar practices are prohibited by most state and federal laws. See Item 1A - Risk Factors: Our Insurance Subsidiaries Must Comply With Extensive Government Regulations.
Ancillary Services and Corporate Segment
The segment is comprised of the parent holding company, our centralized administrative services departments and our ancillary services operations. Our ancillary services operations primarily provide search and valuation services to the mortgage industry through Stewart Lender Services (SLS).
Factors affecting ancillary services revenues. As in the title segment, ancillary services revenues are closely related to the level of activity in the real estate market, which includes the volume of new or refinancing originations.
Companies that compete with our ancillary services businesses vary across a wide range of industries and include the major title insurance underwriters mentioned under “Title Segment - Market share” as well as other real estate technology and business process outsourcing providers.

Customers. Customers for our ancillary services products and services primarily include mortgage lenders and servicers, mortgage brokers and mortgage investors. Many of the services and products offered by our ancillary services business are used by professionals and intermediaries who have been retained to assist consumers with the sale, purchase, mortgage, transfer, recording and servicing of real estate transactions. To that end, timely, accurate and compliant services are critical to our customers since these factors directly affect the service they provide to their customers. Financial strength, scale, robust processes to ensure legal and regulatory compliance, marketplace presence and reputation as a reliable, compliant solution are important factors in attracting new business.
General
Investment policies. Our investment portfolios reside in two domestic and two international regulated insurance underwriters. These underwriters maintain investments in accordance with certain statutory requirements for the funding of premium reserves and deposits, or, in the case of our international operations, for the maintenance of certain capital ratios required by regulators. The activities of the portfolios are overseen by investment committees comprised of certain senior executives. Their oversight includes such activities as policy setting, determining appropriate asset classes with different and distinct risk/return profiles so as to prudently diversify the portfolio, and to approve all service vendors (managers and custodians). We also utilize the expertise of third-party investment advisors to maximize returns while managing risk. Our investment policies are designed to comply with regulatory requirements as applicable law imposes restrictions upon the types and amounts of investments that may be made by the regulated insurance subsidiaries.
Our investment policies further provide that investments are to be managed with a view to balancing profitability, liquidity, and risk (interest rate risk, credit risk, currency rate risk and liquidity risk) while mindful of negatively impacting earnings per share and income taxes.
As of December 31, 2018, approximately 95% of our combined debt and equity investment portfolios consisted of fixed income securities. As of that date, approximately 90% of the fixed income investments are held in securities that are A-rated or higher, and substantially all of the fixed income portfolios are rated investment grade. Percentages are based on the market value of the securities. In addition to our debt and equity investment securities portfolios, we maintain certain money-market and other short-term investments. For more details on market risks related to our investment securities portfolio, refer to Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
Trademarks. We have developed and acquired numerous automated products and processes that are crucial to both our title and ancillary services segments. These systems automate most facets of the real estate transaction. Among these trademarked products and processes are AIM+®, AgencySecure®, PropertyInfo®, SureClose®, TitleSearch®, eTitleSearch®, Virtual Underwriter® and Stewart Now®. We consider these trademarks, which can be renewed every ten years, to be important to our business. 
Employees. As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 5,400 people. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Available information. We electronically file annual, quarterly and other reports and information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). Our electronic filings can be accessed at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. We also make available upon written request, free of charge, or through our Internet site (www.stewart.com), our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, Code of Ethics and, if applicable, amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.
